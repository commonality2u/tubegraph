Stuffed shells are a classic Italian-American entrée, often characterized by different configurations of pasta, red sauce, and ricotta cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This recipe details how to prepare this comforting dish, including a rich tomato sauce, a flavorful [[cheese_filling_for_stuffed_shells | cheese filling]], and instructions for baking and serving, along with a side of garlic bread.

## Tomato Sauce Preparation

The first step is to get a giant pot of sauce going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It's recommended to make extra sauce and freeze it for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Ingredients and Initial Steps
*   Chop two large onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   Peel and chop at least half a head of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Heat a big pot over medium-high heat with plenty of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Add the onions and stir frequently until they soften and begin to brown, which takes about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Open three or four 28-ounce (approximately 800 grams each) cans of crushed tomatoes in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Cooking the Sauce
*   Once the onions are browning, add the chopped garlic. While it could be added from the start, it may burn if not stirred constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Stir in one 6-ounce (170 grams) can of tomato paste and fry it for a moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   Before the tomato paste burns, add the first can of crushed tomatoes to deglaze the pan, scraping the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Add two or three more large cans of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Optionally, add a glass of red or white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Grind in black pepper and preferred dried herbs such as oregano, thyme, and dried basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Add a generous pinch of salt and more olive oil to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Stir everything together and simmer the sauce over medium-low heat, stirring frequently between other tasks to prevent the bottom from burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning. Salt helps to offset bitter notes in canned tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. A pinch of sugar can also be added, which is known as "Clemenza's trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   If the sauce is too thick, loosen it with some water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It can be hit with a stick blender for a smoother consistency, though a chunky sauce is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## [[preparing_filling_ingredients | Cheese Filling Preparation]]

The [[cheese_filling_for_stuffed_shells | cheese filling]] is critical for the stuffed shells. This recipe yields enough for a one-pound bag of shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   1.5 pounds (680 grams) of ricotta cheese. Full-fat ricotta is preferred for taste, but part-skim is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Ricotta is a relatively lean, high-protein cottage cheese type product, recooked from whey, making it the primary bulk of the dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   1 pound (450 grams) of mozzarella, preferably fresh, for smoothness and meltiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Grate it as fine as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   7 ounces (200 grams) of pecorino romano for stronger flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This hard grating cheese, popular in Southern Italy, is similar to parmesan but made with sheep's milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Reserve some for dusting at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   A couple of garlic cloves, grated finely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Four eggs (optional but makes the filling more cakey and less crumbly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   A large amount of black pepper; no salt is needed as the pecorino is salty enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Fresh herbs: parsley (remove thick stems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, chopped finely. Reserve some for garnishing at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   (Optional) Blanched or frozen spinach, thoroughly drained, can be added to the filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Mixing the Filling
*   Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Use your hands to smash and mix everything until a nice, homogeneous mixture, almost like a dough, is formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Shell Preparation and Assembly

### Cooking the Pasta
*   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Use jumbo shells, as smaller ones are difficult to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. A 500-gram package (a little over one pound) is standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Boil the shells for about 12 minutes, or three minutes less than the package directions suggest. This ensures they are pliable for filling but still slightly crunchy, as they will cook further in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Stir frequently to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Drain the shells in a colander and rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process, rinse off starch (to prevent sticking), and cool them for handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Assembling the Dish
*   Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Spread a good layer of tomato sauce in a baking dish, enough so the shells will be "up to their shoulders" in sauce once placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   Fill each parboiled shell with the cheese mixture. While spoons or piping bags can be used, smashing the filling in with fingers is an effective method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Smooshing the shell can help expand the opening for easier filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   Position the filled shells cheese-side up in the sauce so the cheese can brown slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   Avoid topping with more sauce and mozzarella if you want to maintain individual shells rather than create a single mass like [[lasagna_recipe | lasagna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Baking and Serving
*   Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 15-20 minutes until bubbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This steam-cooks the shells, preventing them from drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Remove the foil and turn on the broiler (grill) for a few minutes to get some color on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   Serve by saucing the plate first, then adding the shells. Having extra sauce allows for mopping up with bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   While some prefer a softer, wetter texture, a drier, firmer texture is achieved by reducing the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Garlic Bread

To complement the stuffed shells, make [[pizza_bread_recipe | garlic bread]].

### Ingredients and Preparation
*   Melt two sticks (half a pound / 225 grams) of softened butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Add half a head of chopped garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   Season with a lot of pepper and enough salt to make it slightly too salty, as it will season the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. If using salted butter, less additional salt is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   Herbs can be mixed in, but sprinkling them on at the end is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   Cut a large baguette in half, then split each half lengthwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Slather a generous amount of garlic butter onto the bread, ensuring enough to melt down through the bread during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   Place the bread on a tray, as the butter will leak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Broil (grill) for a few minutes until brown and crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   Garnish with fresh herbs and chop into chunks before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Freezing and Reheating

This recipe makes approximately 25 shells, enough for four to five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. If you have extra filling and shells, you can prepare additional pans for freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Freezing Instructions
*   Cover the pans of unbaked, filled shells and freeze them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Reheating Instructions
*   Place the frozen, covered pan into a cold oven.
*   Turn the oven heat to 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Bake for 45 minutes to an hour, or until thawed and cooked through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Be careful not to overcook the filling, which can make it gritty. It should be bubbling but still appear wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   Remove the foil and turn on the broiler for a few minutes to brown the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Baked pasta dishes often improve when reheated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

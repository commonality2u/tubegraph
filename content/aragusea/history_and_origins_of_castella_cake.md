From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Castella is a simple sponge cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is primarily an egg sponge cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Historical Introduction

Portuguese traders introduced Castella to Japan in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Regional Variations

While a version of Castella that includes cheese has become more popular in Japan today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, the original style, without cheese, is more commonly associated with Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Characteristics

Castella is often baked on a very large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, contributing to its signature [[Texture and Flavors of Jiggly Cake | "wubba wubba"]] or jiggly characteristic when cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This unique texture is a primary focus when baking this cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

The cake is largely composed of egg, with egg mass making up literally half of the cake's total mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The [[ingredient_proportions_for_castella_cake | ingredient proportions for Castella Cake]] are often based on simple whole number ratios by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The structural matrix of the cake is primarily egg, not wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Flavor Profile

When the cake is very warm, it can initially have a sulfurous taste due to its high egg content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. However, this taste dissipates as the cake cools, resulting in a pleasant flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The primary appeal of the cake is its novelty value and its [[Texture and Flavors of Jiggly Cake | springy and pillowy]] texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Flavor variations can be achieved by adding different extracts or ingredients like chocolate chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

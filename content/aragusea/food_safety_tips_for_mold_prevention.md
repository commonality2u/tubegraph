[[moldy_food_and_its_potential_health_risks | Moldy food]] should generally be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While consuming a small amount of mold might not cause immediate harm unless you have an allergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, ingesting large quantities at once can lead to severe sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Scientists believe that repeated consumption of small amounts of mold over many years could result in serious health issues, including cancer, kidney, and liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## What is Mold?

Molds are a type of fungi, similar to mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Unlike plants, fungi do not photosynthesize or produce their own food; instead, they consume existing organic matter, similar to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Molds are considered the smaller, distant cousins of mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

According to mycologist Dr. Megan Bianco Daniels, who specializes in food spoilage, mushrooms are complex organisms with distinct parts like roots, trunks, leaves, stems, caps, and gills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In contrast, [[mold_structure_and_how_it_spreads | molds]] are largely composed of threads of fungal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The individual threads are called hyphae, and their interconnected network is known as the mycelium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### How Mold Spreads

Mold threads begin from an individual spore and grow by releasing enzymes into the environment to dissolve nutrients from food, which they then absorb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The visible blue-green or black-gray fuzzy substance on the surface of moldy food is typically the spores themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Spores are loose on the surface and easily become airborne, which allows them to spread to other wet and nutrient-rich environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Health Risks of Mold

Ingesting mold can be dangerous not only for those with allergies but also due to toxins produced by molds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Molds produce secondary metabolites, which are chemical compounds not essential for their basic growth but can serve purposes like communication or defense against other microbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. When these metabolites are toxic to humans, they are called mycotoxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Mycotoxins can cause acute toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They are not limited to the visible spores on the surface; the majority of the mold organism, the mycelia, spreads unseen throughout soft, open structures like bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Therefore, by the time visible spores appear, extensive mycelia are likely present throughout the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Furthermore, mycotoxins themselves can migrate beyond the mold's body into the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Chronic exposure to small amounts of mycotoxins over time has been linked to various health problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Mycotoxins can:
*   Suppress the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   Damage DNA, potentially leading to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   Damage organs responsible for filtering ingested substances, such as the liver, kidneys, and spleen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Food Handling Guidelines for Moldy Food

The majority opinion among food safety experts is to err on the side of caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Foods to Discard

For soft or wet foods, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends discarding them if they are moldy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This includes:
*   Bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   Yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   Soft cheeses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   Soft fruits and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

### Foods Where Mold Can Be Removed

For firm foods, it may be possible to cut away the moldy part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This applies to:
*   Carrots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>
*   Firm cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>
*   Dry cured meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
When cutting mold off these foods, remove at least an inch of the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Preventing Mold Growth

To minimize the risk of mold growth on susceptible foods, keep them wrapped very tightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Mold spores are airborne, and once they land on food, mold requires air to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Sealing food away from air will help it last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. However, mold will eventually grow as long as nutrients are available and the food is not too acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Exceptions: Intentionally Molded Cheeses

Some cheeses, like blue cheese or brie, are intentionally inoculated with mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. These molds break down fats in the cheese, creating distinct flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The molds used in these cheeses have been intentionally cultivated and domesticated by humans to produce favorable flavors and appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. These domesticated mold strains show a "down regulation" in secondary metabolites that could lead to off-flavors and potential mycotoxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Despite this, some individuals may still have adverse reactions to the molds in these cheeses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Learning how to crack an egg and understand its freshness are fundamental [[kitchen_techniques_for_beginners|kitchen techniques for beginners]] in cooking.

## Cracking Eggs

Cracking an egg requires some practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

*   **Hitting too hard** can cause the egg to break excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   **Hitting not hard enough** requires you to dig in with your thumbs to break it further, which risks sending a shard of shell up inside the egg and breaking the yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Cracking on the side of a bowl** or similar rounded surface is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This method can send spiky bits of shell up inside the egg, potentially stabbing the yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. A bowl also tends to create many small shards that are difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

Instead, it is better to crack an egg on a flat surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Understanding Egg Freshness

The appearance of an egg once cracked into a pan can indicate its freshness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

*   **Moderately Fresh Egg**: There will be a small plateau of elevated white circling the yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This plateau is the white that was attached to the upward-facing side of the yolk inside the shell, which is still attached but slumping over the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The white may also appear a little liquid, running out in small, messy offshoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Really Old Egg**: The white would have broken down significantly, meaning you would not see the plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The white would be super liquid and sit very flat in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Really Fresh Egg**: The white is viscous enough that it holds a very tidy shape in the pan and does not spill out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

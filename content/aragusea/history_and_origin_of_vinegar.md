From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Vinegar, literally meaning "sour wine," is an ancient condiment whose accidental discovery was inevitable due to natural fermentation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The fundamental process of vinegar creation was discovered by ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians (around 5,000 years ago), Egyptians, Chinese, and Greeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Inevitable Discovery

The process begins with a sweet drink, such as fruit juice or grain wort. Ubiquitous environmental yeast consume sugars in the drink, producing alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. If this alcoholic liquid is left exposed to air, another class of microorganisms, known as *acetobacter* bacteria, settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These bacteria consume the alcohol and produce acetic acid, which is what gives vinegar its sour taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

If the *acetobacters* are thriving, they form a gelatinous layer on the surface of the liquid, known as [[the_mother_of_vinegar | the mother of vinegar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This "mother" is a community of acetic acid bacteria that produce cellulose, creating an environment that helps them access air (necessary for vinegar production) and contact the alcohol in the brew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Historically, the biological nature of the "mother" as bacteria was not understood until the late 19th century by Louis Pasteur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It was called "mother" because transferring a piece of it from one vat to another could initiate new vinegar fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Early [[Cultural and Historical Uses of Vinegar | Uses]] and Global Spread

Ancient civilizations likely discovered that this "sour juice" could improve the taste of bland or "off" meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A series of "happy accidents" led to the realization that if food was left in sour juice and sealed from air, it would not spoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This process, known as pickling, allowed food to be preserved in a liquid too acidic for other microbial life to survive, enabling survival during lean times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This vital [[history_of_food_preservation_methods | food preservation method]] contributed to vinegar's global spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Vinegar Production and Aging

Ancient people also learned that at a certain point in the [[vinegar_production_and_fermentation_process | vinegar production process]], the vinegar must be sealed off from oxygen to prevent the *acetobacter* bacteria from consuming all the alcohol and then starting to break down the acetic acid itself, weakening the vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Modern vinegar makers aim for an acetic acid content of 5-7% by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Once sealed, the flavor of the vinegar develops as it ages for months or even years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Balsamic Vinegar

Perhaps the most celebrated vinegar in the world is balsamic, originating from Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The first solid historical mention of balsamic vinegar dates back to 16th century Italy, primarily the Modena region, where it is still predominantly made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Its name, "balsamico," likened its syrupy quality to a balsam, a resin used for perfumes, cosmetics, or medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Unlike other vinegars that use wine, traditional balsamic vinegar uses grape must (boiled-down grape juice) which is then fermented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The most traditional and expensive balsamic vinegar is aged for at least 12 years in a series of successively smaller barrels made from different woods like oak, juniper, ash, and cherry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. As the vinegar ages, it slowly evaporates and reduces due to the slight permeability of the barrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Cheaper versions, such as "Balsamic Vinegar of Modena," are typically grape must mixed with red wine vinegar and aged for only about 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Vinegar and Alcohol

Vinegar is always made from alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Industrial acetic acid can be produced chemically, but in most countries, it cannot be sold as food-grade vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The alcohol content of the precursor liquid cannot be too high (e.g., above 10% booze) for the *acetobacters* to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

This fact has historically presented a dilemma in the Islamic world, where intoxicants are forbidden, yet the Prophet Muhammad himself reportedly loved vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Historically, vinegar in the Islamic world was manufactured through a process of "double fermentation," where grape juice ferments directly into vinegar without an intermediate stable wine stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Finished food-grade vinegar typically retains a small amount of alcohol, usually between 0.2% and 0.4% by volume, which contributes to flavor but is not enough to cause intoxication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Historical Anecdote: French Navy

A notable anecdote from the history of vinegar involves the French Navy during the Seven Years' War, which used vinegar to swab ship decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Unscrupulous contractors attempted to pass off wine as vinegar by having workers urinate in it to make it acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Surprisingly, this accelerated the fermentation process, making the fraudulent vinegar convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Making Vinegar at Home

An open bottle of wine left for a few days may taste sour, but it's not yet true vinegar due to other chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Sulfites, commonly added to wine since ancient times to prevent it from turning into vinegar, also delay this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. To accelerate the process, one can add hydrogen peroxide to neutralize sulfites and dilute the wine if its alcohol content is too high for bacteria to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. While wild *acetobacters* can eventually colonize the diluted wine, a more reliable and faster method is to "seed" the wine with some [[the_mother_of_vinegar | mother of vinegar]], typically obtained from unpasteurized apple cider vinegar with live mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. After a few weeks, with proper aeration, the mother will form, and vinegar will be produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Once made, sealing the vinegar in an airtight container in a dark pantry can preserve it for a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

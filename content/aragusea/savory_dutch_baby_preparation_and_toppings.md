From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

A savory Dutch baby is a variation of the traditional popover, which is a very wet, unleavened pancake batter that steams significantly in the oven and "pops over" the pan's rim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While the [[traditional_sweet_dutch_baby_recipe | traditional sweet version]] is often considered bland, the savory Dutch baby is designed for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The term "Dutch" in "Dutch baby" is likely an anglicization of "deutsche," indicating a German origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Batter Preparation

The batter for a savory Dutch baby is similar to a sweet one, but with specific additions to enhance flavor.

### Ingredients and Ratios
*   **Eggs:** The recipe uses two eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Salt:** A big pinch of salt per egg is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Sugar:** Even for a savory recipe, a teaspoon of sugar per egg is added; this does not make it dessert but helps bring the taste alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. No vanilla is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Flour:** A third of a cup (40 grams) of flour per egg is the traditional ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Starch:** Replacing up to half of the flour with cornstarch or any other starch makes the final product more tender, though potentially less "poofy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Milk:** A third of a cup (80 milliliters) of warm milk per egg is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Cheese:** A spoonful of soft, spreadable cheese like ricotta, brie, or mascarpone significantly improves the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Adding cheese may reduce how much the baby puffs up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Preparation Steps ([[dutch_baby_batter_preparation_techniques | Dutch baby batter preparation techniques]])
1.  **Warm Ingredients:** To achieve a bigger rise, warm refrigerated eggs in hot tap water for a minute or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Warm cold milk in the microwave for about 30 seconds, ensuring it's not hot enough to cook the eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Mix Eggs and Seasonings:** Crack eggs into a bowl, add salt and sugar, and whisk until the eggs are loose and frothy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
3.  **Incorporate Flour and Starch:** Whisk in the flour and starch first, creating a thick mixture that is easier to de-lump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
4.  **Add Milk and Cheese:** Gradually whisk in the warm milk until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Then, whisk in the soft cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
5.  **Rest the Batter:** Let the batter sit for at least 20 minutes to allow particles to hydrate and proteins to autolyze, resulting in a more elastic batter that can expand like a balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Some people let it sit overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Cooking Process

### Pan and Oven Preparation
*   **Oven Temperature:** Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Heat the Pan:** Place the pan (traditionally cast iron, but non-stick can be used) into the oven while it heats, as this is more efficient than heating on the stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Butter:** Once the pan is very hot, melt a good layer of butter in it; it should melt enthusiastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Less butter might be needed in a non-stick pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Pour Batter:** Pour the batter into the hot pan immediately before the butter burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The batter should appear watery, as water creates steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A 10-inch (25 cm) pan can accommodate a two-egg popover for a thinner product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Baking
*   **Baking Time:** Close the oven and try not to open it until the Dutch baby is puffy and golden brown, which takes about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Keeping the heat and steam in is crucial to prevent collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Collapsing:** The Dutch baby will deflate once removed from the oven as the steam subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It's recommended to document its puffed state for "the gram" before it collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Pan Recommendation:** [[quality_cookware_recommendations_for_making_dutch_babies | Non-stick pans]] can be used, requiring less butter and allowing for easy removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Misen non-stick pans are noted for their durability and oven-safe handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. For cast iron, extra butter on the bottom can help with removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Savory Toppings

Toppings are prepared while the Dutch baby bakes to be ready for immediate addition.

### Ingredients
*   **Green Onion:** Sliced at an extreme angle, green onion provides oniony flavor, crunch, and a pretty green garnish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Eggs:** Two eggs are cracked and seasoned in advance (e.g., with harissa powder) for easy sliding onto the Dutch baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This is similar to [[preparing_a_frittata | preparing a frittata]] in terms of egg usage.
*   **Salami:** Slices of fancy salami are used, but any [[toppings_and_seasoning_for_pan_pizza | pizza topping]] that works well could be substituted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Application
1.  **Initial Bake:** Bake the Dutch baby until it's basically done and has puffed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
2.  **Add Toppings:** When the Dutch baby is slightly underdone and before it cools too much, slide the pre-cracked eggs onto the middle, scatter the green onions, and tear on the salami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A strip of salami can be placed down the middle to keep eggs separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
3.  **Final Bake:** Return to the oven for about five minutes until the eggs are cooked to your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Eggs will continue cooking slightly as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Serving

*   **Cooling Rack:** Pull the Dutch baby out onto a cooling rack to prevent the bottom from getting soggy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Cutting:** Once the bottom has steamed out, cut the Dutch baby. A large slice can be cut, with a smaller slice served on the side for dipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Taste:** This savory version is considered good enough to eat, unlike some traditional Dutch babies, and is notably easier than a "breakfast pizza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

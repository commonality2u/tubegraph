Traditional white pizza sauces are often based on ricotta cheese, which can result in a bland flavor profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. An alternative approach involves creating a more flavorful garlicky cream sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This recipe is designed to yield enough sauce for one 12 or 13-inch pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Ingredients for Garlicky Cream Sauce

*   **Garlic**: Approximately four or five cloves, chopped finely (about 24 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Hard Cheese**: Grated Pecorino Romano is recommended for its acidity, which helps replace the acidity normally found in tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Parmesan can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The amount should be roughly the same volume as the chopped garlic, or about 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Butter**: A small amount for sautéing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Heavy Cream**: Approximately 151 grams, or about half a cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Pepper**: To taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Note that salt is generally not needed due to the cheese's salt content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Sauce Preparation Steps

1.  **Prepare Garlic and Cheese**: Chop the garlic finely and grate the hard cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
2.  **Sauté Garlic**: Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped garlic and cook until it just begins to turn golden, ensuring it does not burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
3.  **Add Cream**: Pour in the heavy cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Bring the cream to a boil, then immediately turn off the heat before it boils over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
4.  **Cool and Combine**: Allow the cream to cool down until bubbling has stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This is crucial; adding hard cheese to boiling sauce can cause proteins to overcoagulate, resulting in a grainy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Once cooled, grind in some pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  **Check Texture**: The sauce is at a perfect consistency when it leaves a clear trail when a spatula is dragged across the bottom of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This consistency resembles [[innovative_sauce_and_flavor_combinations_for_pizza | Alfredo sauce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Achieving Optimal Sauce Texture on Pizza

For a successful [[making_a_white_pizza_with_a_garlicky_cream_sauce | white pizza]], applying a very thin layer of sauce is essential due to its richness and intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **Adjusting Viscosity**: As the sauce cools, it may stiffen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. To ensure it can be spread thinly, mix in additional fresh cream as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Aim for the thinnest possible application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. A silicone spatula can be used like a putty knife to spread the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Baking Considerations**: When [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking the pizza]], it is vital not to overcook the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. If the sauce gets too hot, the fat will separate, forming an undesirable yellow grease layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Post-Bake**: After [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking]], rest the pizza on a cooling rack to help maintain crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Freshly chopped rosemary can be sprinkled on top after a few minutes of cooling; the residual heat will soften the herb without browning it instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

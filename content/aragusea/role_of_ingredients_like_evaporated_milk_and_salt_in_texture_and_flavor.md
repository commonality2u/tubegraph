Certain ingredients play crucial roles in defining the texture and flavor of homemade ice cream, especially when made without a traditional ice cream maker.

## Evaporated Milk

Using evaporated milk in a Philadelphia-style ice cream recipe can significantly improve the final product compared to regular milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The higher protein content in evaporated milk contributes to a smoother ice cream texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Adding dried milk powder to an ice cream mix achieves a similar result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For a Philadelphia-style ice cream, one cup (235 ml) of evaporated milk or regular milk can be used in combination with cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. In French-style ice cream, regular milk is typically used because the egg yolks provide sufficient protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Salt

Salt serves multiple purposes in ice cream making, primarily for chilling and flavor enhancement:

### For Chilling
Salt is stirred into the ice surrounding the inner bowl in the "two bowls method" of ice cream making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Lowering Melting Point**: Salt lowers the melting point of ice, creating supercooled water that effectively chills the inner bowl containing the ice cream mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Type and Ratio**: Normal kosher salt can be used, with a rough ratio of one part salt to four parts ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Ice Cream Salt**: While "ice cream salt" is available and sometimes preferred for its larger grains (which some claim disperse more evenly), its main advantage is often its lower cost due to impurities, as it is not intended for human consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Crushed ice, due to its increased surface area, makes better contact with the salt and inner bowl, though normal ice cubes also work effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### For Flavor
A pinch of salt can significantly improve the flavor of nearly any ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

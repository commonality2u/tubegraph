Vinegar, which literally means "sour wine," often begins its life with the formation of a [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|Mother of Vinegar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Accidental Discovery and Formation

The accidental creation of vinegar is a process that has been discovered repeatedly throughout [[history_and_origin_of_vinegar | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This "inevitable" transformation was known to [[history_and_origin_of_vinegar | ancient Babylonians]] around 5,000 years ago, as well as [[history_and_origin_of_vinegar | ancient Egyptians]], [[history_and_origin_of_vinegar | Chinese]], and [[history_and_origin_of_vinegar | Greeks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Reginald Smith, author of "Vinegar: The Eternal Condiment," experienced this firsthand. After home-brewing a maple wine that "tasted absolutely horrible," he left it on his counter over a Christmas vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Upon returning, he found a "gelatinous layer" on top, which he identified as a [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This unintentional fermentation led him to start his own company, Supreme Vinegar, which produces boutique vinegars and supplies [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] to other makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## What is a Mother of Vinegar?

The formation of a [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] is a key step in the [[vinegar_production_and_fermentation_process | fermentation process]] of vinegar.
1.  It begins with a sweet drink, such as fruit juice or a wort made from grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  Ubiquitous yeast in the environment consume the sugars, producing alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
3.  As the alcoholic liquid continues to sit, a different type of microorganism, `acetobacter` bacteria, settle in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
4.  These bacteria consume the alcohol and produce acetic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
5.  If conditions are favorable, these `acetobacter` bacteria form a "gelatinous layer" or "little house," which is known as the [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

A [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] is essentially a large collection of bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These acetic acid bacteria produce cellulose, the same compound found in leaves and grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This cellulose structure provides an environment that helps the bacteria access the air they need to make vinegar, as well as contact the alcohol in the brew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Naming and Understanding

The term "mother" was used because, historically, people observed that transferring this gelatinous mass from one vat of wine to another could "start another vinegar fermentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. It wasn't until the late 19th century, with the work of Louis Pasteur, that it was understood that the [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] was made from bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Using Mother of Vinegar

In modern [[vinegar_production_and_fermentation_process | vinegar production]], it is much faster and more reliable to introduce a piece of [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] into alcohol rather than waiting for wild `acetobacter` from the environment to colonize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Making Vinegar at Home

To make vinegar at home, you can use an existing [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]]:
1.  **Prepare the Wine**: If using an open bottle of wine, it may have preservatives called sulfites that delay the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. These can be broken down by adding about half a teaspoon of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution per bottle and shaking it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Dilute the Alcohol**: Most commercial wines have a high enough alcohol concentration to kill bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. It's recommended to cut your wine with an equal part of water to dilute the alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Introduce the Mother**: Seed your wine with some [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother of vinegar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. A common method is to use apple cider vinegar with live [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother]] at the bottom; shake the bottle to redistribute it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. Reginald Smith suggests using about eight ounces of this per bottle of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
4.  **Ferment**: Cover the container with breathable material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. In a couple of weeks, the [[Vinegar Production and Fermentation Process#Mother of Vinegar|mother]] will form on top, and your vinegar will be ready underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
5.  **Seal and Store**: Once ready, seal the vinegar in an airtight container in a dark pantry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. If left exposed to air, the `acetobacter` will consume any remaining alcohol and then start breaking down the acetic acid itself, weakening the vinegar until only water is left or it spoils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

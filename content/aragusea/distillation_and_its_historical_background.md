## What is Liquor? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>
By a broad definition, liquor refers to any alcoholic beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. An alcoholic beverage is generally defined as anything drinkable containing at least one or two percent ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Ethanol is the specific type of alcohol consumed recreationally, chemically composed of two carbon atoms, several hydrogen atoms, and a hydroxyl group (an oxygen atom stuck to a hydrogen atom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Drinks with less than about one percent ethanol are virtually impossible to get intoxicated by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Biological Ceiling of Alcohol Content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
Traditionally made beer or wine has a biological ceiling on its ethanol content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These beverages are made by introducing yeast to a sweet, nutrient-rich liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The yeast metabolizes this liquid, producing ethanol as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, ethanol is poisonous, and yeast can only raise its concentration in the brew so high before it becomes toxic to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. High concentrations of ethanol disrupt proteins and cell membranes in yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Consequently, beer and wine generally max out at an alcohol content somewhere in the teens (percentage points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Introduction to Distillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
To create a beverage with a higher alcohol content than yeast can naturally produce, the alcohol must be extracted and refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This process is called distillation, which yields "liquor" in the narrow definition of the word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Historical Background of Distillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
Distillation dates back to the ancient world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Illustrations show [[pot_still_versus_column_still_distillation | pot stills]] used by a Greek alchemist in 3rd century CE Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, with even earlier evidence in Mesopotamia and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Ancient people likely discovered distillation by observing that boiling a liquid transforms it into steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. They would have noticed that this steam condenses back into a liquid on nearby surfaces, but the condensed liquid was not the same as the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For example, muddy water would yield clear, pure water upon distillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

An early, low-tech method was "rag distillation," where a fibrous material (like a dish rag or wool) was tied around a stick and held over boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The liquid would condense onto the fibers and could then be squeezed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This demonstrates how unwanted substances are left behind when the desired substance evaporates and is collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Ancient civilizations used clay and later metals to create "retorts" – fat jugs holding liquid over a fire, with a narrow neck for vapors to rise, cool, and drip into a "receiver" cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The discovery of alcohol distillation might have occurred if ancient people noticed ethanol condensing from simmering wine-based stews, recognizing its potent "kinesthetic sense of heat" compared to un-distilled alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Types of Stills

### Pot Still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
The [[pot_still_versus_column_still_distillation | pot still]] is the original and simplest type of still, easy to clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Distilleries like Cardinal Spirits use them for "dirty," "sticky," or "chunky" precursor liquids, such as grain-based washes or rum fermented from molasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This method is a "batch distillation," producing one batch at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

#### The Process in a Pot Still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
To distill ethanol, a fermented liquid (e.g., wine) is heated. Ethanol boils at about 78°C (173°F), significantly lower than water's boiling point of 100°C (212°F) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This difference allows the ethanol to vaporize while most of the water remains liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The ethanol gas travels up a column and then enters a condenser (e.g., a serpentine condenser tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The condenser cools the gas, often using circulating water, causing it to condense back into a liquid that drips into a receiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Column Still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>
A [[pot_still_versus_column_still_distillation | column still]] is a more efficient, continuous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Instead of a batch pot, it continuously pumps liquid (e.g., wine) into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. In a column still, ethanol vapors rise up through multiple columns, while water tends to fall down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Each column effectively acts as a distillation step, allowing for continuous "rectification" or cleanup of the alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Column stills are used to strip out "heads" (toxic early distillates) in later columns, leaving the desired product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Congeners and Cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>
Distilled spirits contain "congeners," which are substances other than ethanol that also evaporate at low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. These can include non-poisonous elements like tannins and esters, which contribute to flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, congeners also include harmful "fusel alcohols," such as methanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Methanol, which has one carbon atom instead of two, can cause permanent blindness in small amounts (10 milliliters) and be fatal in larger doses (30 milliliters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

To remove methanol, distillers perform "cuts" during the distillation run:
*   **Head Cuts (or Foreshot):** The first portion of distillate that comes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Methanol is more volatile than ethanol, so most of it comes up at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This highly poisonous initial output is traditionally discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Heart Cuts:** The middle portion of the run, which is the purest ethanol and the desired product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Tail Cuts:** The last bits of distillate, which also contain more unwanted congeners and are typically discarded or re-distilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Traditionally, distillers would use their senses of smell and taste to determine the cut-off points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Modern distilleries use scientific instruments for more precise separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Rectification and Spirit Types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
Rectification refers to repeating the distillation process multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Vodka:** If the spirit is rectified enough times, nearly all congeners are stripped out, leaving 95% ethanol and a small amount of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This highly rectified spirit, often diluted with water to reduce intensity, is vodka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Vodka can be made from various fermented bases, including grapes, potatoes, corn, wheat, rye, or oats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Flavorful Spirits (Brandy, Whiskey, Gin):** If distillation only removes most of the water and methanol while retaining other non-poisonous congeners, the result is a more flavorful spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. For example:
    *   **Brandy:** From grape juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **Whiskey:** From beer (grain-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   **Gin:** A juniper-flavored vodka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Aging in Barrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>
After distillation, spirits are often aged in wooden barrels, originally for storage but later for flavor development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### Barrel Charring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>
Barrels, especially new white oak ones for bourbon, are often charred on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Historically, charring might have been for cleaning or sterilizing barrels and removing lingering flavors from previous contents (e.g., salted fish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. However, it was soon realized that this imparts smoky flavors, such as vanilla and cherry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### Flavor Transfer and Maturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
In environments not fully climate-controlled, barrels expand and contract with temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This process repeatedly pulls the liquor into and out of the wood, infusing it with wood flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The alcohol itself also undergoes chemical changes during aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Achieving a smooth spirit can take years or even decades, which is why many famous aged spirit companies are centuries old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Newer distilleries often sell unaged spirits like vodkas, gins, or un-aged rums to generate income while their aged products mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

Aging is an unpredictable "magic" where barrels from the same batch can yield vastly different results, some perfect and others needing more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Master distillers often blend liquor from different barrels to achieve specific qualities and create special spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

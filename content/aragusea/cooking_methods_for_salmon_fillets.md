Salmon is an excellent fish for beginners to cook due to its forgiving nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It remains good whether cooked perfectly medium, undercooked, raw, or even somewhat overcooked, thanks to its high fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Selecting Salmon Fillets
When buying salmon, fillets are a common choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Farmed vs. Wild Salmon
*   **Color**: Farmed salmon has a pale orange color, while wild salmon, particularly Sockeye, has a more intense reddish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The color in farmed salmon comes from added astaxanthin pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, whereas wild salmon obtain it naturally from crustaceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Fat Content**: Farmed salmon usually has a higher fat content, visible as white ribbons through the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Omega Fatty Acids**: Wild salmon is generally considered superior due to its favorable omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Farmed salmon has a proportionally higher omega-6 content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Fresh vs. Frozen
Unless you live near a fishery like in Alaska, wild salmon is likely frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Modern flash freezing is highly effective at preserving quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Fillet Shapes and Preparation
Fillets come in three basic shapes, which can affect [[identifying_different_cuts_of_salmon_fillets | cooking techniques]]:
*   **"Car" shape**: Often a favorite due to its uneven thickness, providing a sampler of different doneness levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The thinner belly part has more fat and benefits from being slightly overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **"Flat" pieces**: Thinner and more even in thickness, ideal for even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **"Tail" piece**: Also an even thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Before [[how_to_cook_salmon_fillets_perfectly | cooking salmon fillets]]:
*   **Pin Bones**: Remove any remaining pin bones by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Skin**: The scales are usually removed, and the skin can be eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It is generally easier to remove the skin after the fish is cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## [[cooking_techniques | Cooking Techniques]] for Salmon Fillets

### Pan-Searing
Pan-searing is a common and effective [[cooking_techniques | cooking technique]] for salmon. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, which browns nicely at salmon [[cooking_techniques | searing temperatures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Use olive oil, ensuring it shimmers but doesn't smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

*   **Cooking Process**: Cook most of the way on the flesh side to develop a delicious crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. A "window" on the side of the fillet allows you to monitor the cooking progress by observing the color change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A mild sizzle is ideal for the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Doneness**: Flip when the color change indicates it's cooked about halfway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. For medium-rare, pull the fish when the "window" still shows a hair of raw center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Undercooked salmon, warm but raw in the center, is safe if it was frozen (killing parasites) and the surface was cooked (sterilizing bacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Overcooked salmon may crumble but remains moist due to melting fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

#### Pan Types:
*   **Stainless Steel Pan**: Can lead to sticking and breaking if the crust isn't fully set before flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Teflon Pan**: The easiest option for [[how_to_cook_salmon_fillets_perfectly | cooking salmon fillets]] due to its non-stick properties, making flipping effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Cast Iron Pan**: A good alternative to Teflon, but may still stick if not well-seasoned or if confidence is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. After flipping, you can add butter and lemon juice for basting, creating a beurre blanc-like sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Broiling (Grilling)
Broiling is another simple and effective [[cooking_techniques | cooking technique]] for salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Process**: Use an oven-safe pan with oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Set the broiler to its highest heat unless the fillet is very thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Season with pepper, but initially omit salt if using a salty glaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Glaze**: A quick glaze can be made with honey and soy sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Apply an initial brushing, then brush again after some cooking time to prevent excess honey from burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Doneness**: The salmon is cooked when small spaces begin to open up between the flakes of meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. There's no need to flip when broiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Mashed Potato Crusted Salmon
This [[nontraditional_cooking_methods | cooking method]] is a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: Heat mashed potatoes until soft and spreadable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Mix in fresh herbs like dill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> and a generous handful of shredded cheese (e.g., Parmesan) to help bind it into a crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Assembly**: Place salmon (preferably a flat piece for even cooking) in an oiled, oven-safe pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Season the salmon with salt separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Press a thin layer of the cheesy mash over the salmon, leaving a small exposed section to monitor doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Cooking**: Broil under high heat until the crust is brown and the salmon flakes begin to open up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Wild Sockeye Salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska, is highlighted as a sustainable and healthy choice, rich in omega-3s and astaxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Salmon is a versatile and forgiving fish, making it ideal for those new to [[how_to_cook_salmon_fillets_perfectly | cooking fish]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

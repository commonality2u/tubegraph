Pizza bread is a crispy and flavorful loaf of bread made from aged pizza dough, which kids often call "pizza bread" due a texture and flavor profile reminiscent of pizza crust but in bread form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method simplifies traditional pre-ferment processes by using refrigeration to develop flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## [[pizza_dough_ingredients_and_preparation | Pizza Dough Ingredients and Preparation]]

This [[recipe_for_homemade_pizza_bread | recipe for homemade pizza bread]] starts with a large batch of standard [[pizza_dough_ingredients and preparation | pizza dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   Warm water: ½ cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Sugar: 2 teaspoons (for yeast activation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, plus 2 tablespoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> (to enhance browning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Yeast: 2 teaspoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Additional warm water: 4 cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Salt: 2 tablespoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Olive oil: About ¼ cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:15]</a>, plus extra for coating containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Bread flour: 10 cups (start with this amount, anticipate adding more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:20]</a>

### [[pizza_dough_preparation | Dough Preparation]]
1.  **Activate Yeast:** Combine ½ cup warm water with 2 teaspoons sugar and 2 teaspoons yeast. Stir and let bloom for 5 minutes to ensure yeast is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  **Combine Wet Ingredients:** Add 4 more cups of warm water, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of salt, and about ¼ cup of olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Mix and Knead:** Begin incorporating 10 cups of bread flour, mixing as much as possible with a spatula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:22]</a>. Then, use your hand to bring the dough together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:28]</a>.
4.  **Achieve Desired Consistency:** Add just enough flour to make kneading possible, keeping the dough wet and sticky for better flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
5.  **Knead for Gluten Development:** Knead the dough until it can be stretched thin without tearing, which took seven minutes in the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
6.  **Portioning and Oiling:** Divide the dough into 300-gram portions, which is good for one 12 or 13-inch pizza or one pizza bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:15]</a>. Weighing is recommended for consistency when making larger batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:21]</a>. Coat each portion with olive oil and use the dough ball to oil its container, covering it tightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Glass containers are preferred as they do not leach chemicals during long rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## [[aging_pizza_dough | Aging Pizza Dough]]

The key to flavorful, crispy pizza bread is [[aging_pizza_dough | aging the pizza dough]] in the refrigerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Refrigerating the dough immediately after preparation, without a prior room temperature rise, is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Evolution of Dough Over Time
*   **Day 0 (No aging):** Dough rises on the table for two hours. The underside is smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:46]</a>. The baked bread is soft and pillowy with large bubbles, bland flavor, and is not crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This is considered an inferior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Day 1 (24 hours cold rise):** Dough has risen significantly in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The underside becomes rough and bubbly, which helps it hold more oil and crisp in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The texture is less pillowy with finer bubbles, offering a bit of crunch and chew, though flavor is still flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Cold dough is also stiffer and easier to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Day 2 (48 hours cold rise):** Dough becomes stickier and starts to smell faintly like beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:38]</a>. The flavor improves, developing a yeasty, fermented taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Day 3 (72 hours cold rise):** Dough is very sticky with a noticeably uneven, bubbly underside that holds oil well for crisping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The baked surface becomes much crispier, possibly due to starches breaking down into simpler sugars that caramelize more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. A glassy top starts to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Day 4 (4 days cold rise):** A delicious smell like ripe banana develops in both raw and cooked dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Day 5 (5 days cold rise):** Dough becomes very gooey, almost impossible to handle if not cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:54]</a>. The "ripe banana" note persists, adding a funky, complex flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Day 6 (6 days cold rise):** The top surface is becoming extremely crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:09]</a>. The interior is much chewier; wet dough, given enough time, can develop gluten on its own, essentially "kneading" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Day 7 (1 week cold rise):** Dough is super gooey and sticky, requiring it to be cold for handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:25]</a>. The underside (which becomes the top when baked) is craggy and soaks up oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The texture is amazing, with an incredibly crispy top and a flavor akin to sourdough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Topping and Baking
1.  **Prepare for Baking:** Once ready to bake, take an aged dough portion from the fridge. Place the dough with the rougher, bubbly underside facing up on a plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
2.  **Add Toppings:** Coat the surface generously with olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Grind on pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, shake on plenty of garlic powder (gives an umami taste, prefer over fresh for this recipe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, and sprinkle a good amount of large, crunchy flaky salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Be careful not to let the garlic powder burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
3.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to maximum convection temperature (e.g., 550°F / 290°C) with a pizza stone inside for at least half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. A pizza stone is preferred over a pizza steel for this bread as the steel tends to burn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
4.  **Bake:** Carefully pull the hot pizza stone out of the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Drop the dough onto the stone, baking until brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This usually takes 7 or 8 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
5.  **Cool and Serve:** Pull the baked bread off with tongs onto a cooling rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Slice it once lengthwise and then into smaller strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:29]</a>.

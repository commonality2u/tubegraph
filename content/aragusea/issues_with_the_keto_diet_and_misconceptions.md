The ketogenic (keto) diet is a popular [[low_carb_dieting_strategies | low carb]] diet that restricts starch and sugar, similar to Atkins and [[flaws_of_raw_and_paleo_diets | paleo]] diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. While often promoted for weight loss, the modern ketogenic diet was originally invented in the early 20th century as a preventive treatment for seizures, not obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

## Medical Application and Mechanism

The ketogenic diet has been known for decades to help control epileptic seizures in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. This is essentially the extent of its medically evidenced benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

The diet works by forcing the body to produce ketone bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. This happens when nearly all carbohydrate calories are replaced with fat calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. The brain then uses these ketone bodies instead of its normal fuel, glucose (blood sugar), which helps prevent epileptic seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Misconceptions

Despite its specific medical application, people have adopted keto as a fad diet for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. However, a significant issue is that very few people who believe they are following a keto diet actually achieve the extreme fat-to-carb ratio necessary to put their body into ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

A true ketogenic diet, like those designed for children with epilepsy, might involve consuming heavy whipping cream with every meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. Most individuals, unless they are elite athletes or have an obsessive-compulsive personality, find it difficult to stick to a true ketogenic diet for more than three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. They tend to reintroduce carbohydrates into their diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>, as staples like bread and pasta are highly appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. To truly reach ketosis, carbohydrate intake needs to be as low as about 50 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

According to Dr. Tim Crowe, a nutrition researcher, the primary dietary problem in affluent societies often stems from consuming too many calories from refined carbohydrates, processed foods, sugary junk, and fast food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. Therefore, any diet plan, including keto, that eliminates most of these items is likely to be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

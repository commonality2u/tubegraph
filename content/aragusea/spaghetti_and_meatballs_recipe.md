This spaghetti and meatballs recipe is described as "Italian-American culture on a plate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, big, sloppy, loud, and awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Meatball Preparation

This recipe's meatballs are made similarly to "grandma ragu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Ingredients

*   **Breadcrumbs**: An essential ingredient that prevents meatballs from becoming tiny hamburgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Approximately 20 grams or 1/3 of a cup of breadcrumbs are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Stale bread can be grated to make fresh breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Milk**: Used to soak the breadcrumbs. Soaking in milk, rather than water, improves the flavor and allows milk sugars to caramelize on the outside of the finished meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Cheese**: Pecorino or Parmesan cheese is used for "insane flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. About 20 grams, or 1/3 of a cup, is added to the meat mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Grating on the finest side is preferred for topping the pasta later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Ground Meat**: About a pound of ground meat, specifically beef chuck, is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Fattier meat makes better meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Lamb can also be mixed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Seasonings**:
    *   **Garlic Powder**: Rehydrates in the meat and provides a stronger flavor than fresh garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> (about half a teaspoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   **Onion Powder**: Easier to use and can taste better in this application than fresh onions, which would need pre-cooking or pureeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   **Black Pepper**: A good amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   **Cayenne Pepper**: A little shake (from Chef John's preference, also done by grandma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It adds a background flavor, making the meatballs taste fuller without making them spicy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   **Salt**: At least half a teaspoon, or a "real big pinch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Remember the cheese is salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Mixing and Shaping

*   **Breadcrumbs**: Lift the soaked breadcrumbs out of the milk, leaving loose milk behind. You can also squeeze them, but leaving more milk in generally results in better-tasting meatballs, though they will be softer and harder to cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **No Egg**: Eggs are considered unnecessary and can make meatballs rubbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Mixing Technique**: Use fingertips to almost toss the mixture together, avoiding overmixing, which can make the meatballs tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Keeping the mixture somewhat heterogeneous leaves "fault lines" that allow them to crumble pleasantly in the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Seasoning Test**: Cook a tiny bit of the mixture (e.g., in the microwave) to kill bacteria, then taste and adjust seasonings, especially salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Shaping**: Roll meatballs to about a ping-pong ball size, or slightly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Smaller sizes can make browning difficult without breaking them, while larger sizes reduce browned surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Coating**: Do not coat in flour before frying, as it can create a slimy texture after soaking in sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Resting**: Ideally, cover and refrigerate the meatballs for a while, even overnight. This improves flavor and helps them hold together during [[cooking_techniques_for_meatballs | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Cooking the Meatballs

*   **Pan**: Use a pan large enough to cook both the meatballs and the tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A well-seasoned cast-iron or Teflon pan is best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Heat & Oil**: Add olive oil to the pan over moderate heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Ensure the oil is hot before adding meatballs to get a good crust, which prevents them from breaking when flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Browning**: Roll the meatballs around to brown as much surface area as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The goal is not perfectly round meatballs, which are often achieved by deep-frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Be conservative with heat to prevent the fond (browned bits at the bottom of the pan) from burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Tomato Sauce Preparation

The sauce is made in the same pan after browning the meatballs to incorporate the dissolved meatball fond and rendered beef fat for amazing flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

*   **Tomato Paste**: Add a big squeeze of tomato paste and let it fry for a second before it burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This provides "incredible instant depth" to a quick [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | tomato sauce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Crushed Tomatoes**: Add a high-quality 28-ounce can (about 800 grams) of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Deglaze**: Deglaze the bottom of the pan to scrape up the fond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Reduction**: Use a small quantity of tomatoes in a wide pan to reduce them quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A "tight texture" on [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | tomato sauce]] for pasta is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The sauce should be done in about ten minutes, by the time the spaghetti boils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Pan Material**: A cast-iron pan can be used for the sauce, even though it reacts with acid, as it takes a long time for a noticeable amount of iron to leach into the sauce, and this sauce cooks quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Spaghetti Preparation

*   **Water**: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Spaghetti**: Add half a pound of spaghetti (half a box, 225-250 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Breaking**: The spaghetti can be broken in half to make it easier to get the desired amount on each forkful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Combining and Serving

*   **Cheese & Herbs in Sauce**: When the pasta is almost done, turn off the heat for the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Mix some grated cheese (Pecorino or Parmesan) and fresh herbs (like parsley) directly into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Taste for seasoning as the cheese adds salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Pasta Texture**: Drain the pasta. For a looser texture, some pasta water can be kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Mixing**: Add the sauce into the pasta pot, rather than the other way around. This helps ensure the pasta isn't over-sauced and allows for a "tight, verging on dry" texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Serving Presentation**:
    *   Undersauce the spaghetti in the pot to preserve heterogeneity or layering of textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   Place the spaghetti on the plate, then scoop more sauce and some meatballs on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. It's nice to have some meatballs sitting right on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   For garnishing, place parsley or basil on first, then cheese on top. This allows the cheese to stay white and look like "fresh fallen snow on the leaves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Portions**: Half a box of pasta with the added bulk of meatballs provides enough food for three or four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, offering a higher meat-to-pasta ratio than traditional grandma recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Desired Meatball Texture

The meatballs should crumble pleasantly when cut with a fork, rather than having a rubber ball texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This soft texture is achieved by avoiding egg as a binder and not overmixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

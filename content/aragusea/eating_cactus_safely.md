While it may seem unusual to those unaccustomed to it, nearly every part of the [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | prickly pear cactus]] (genus *Opuntia*) is edible and potentially quite tasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This plant is abundant in the warmer parts of the Western Hemisphere and is very common in Latin American cuisine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, there are significant [[dangers_of_glochids_on_cacti | hazards]] associated with preparing and consuming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Identifying Edible Parts and Ripeness

The [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | prickly pear cactus]] produces large purple fruits called *tuna* (no relation to tuna fish, it's an indigenous American word) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. These are true berries with soft, sweet, and sour flesh containing a pulpy core of small, hard seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The *tuna* grow from the outer leaves, known as paddles or pads, or *nopales* in Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Both the *tuna* and the *nopales* are edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

*   **Tuna (Fruit)**: Generally ripen in the fall, but can still be found ripening in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Ripe *tuna* are no longer green and twist almost effortlessly off the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Their taste is described as generically fruity with a slight vegetal note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Less ripe fruits are more acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The seeds are hard but not poisonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Nopales (Paddles)**: The best *nopales* are typically new growth paddles that sprout in the springtime; these are lighter green and more tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They have a texture similar to okra due to mucilage, a gluey polysaccharide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Their taste is described as a fruity tasting vegetable, like sour green beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Harvesting pads in the morning can result in lower acid content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## The Danger of Glochids

The primary [[dangers_of_glochids_on_cacti | hazard]] when handling prickly pear cacti are nearly microscopic, barbed thorns called *glochids* (or *glochidia*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   **Characteristics**: Glochids are barbed, hooking into the skin and releasing from the plant easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. They are small enough to pass through a strainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Symptoms**: You might not notice them going in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. When pressure is applied, they cause a minor but sharp pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. They can also cause a generalized dull aching or inflammation/dermatitis that can last for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Some people have a particularly strong reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Removal**: Once embedded, the barbed tips break off and remain under the skin even if the exposed part is pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   In the 1980s, researchers found that immediately removing exposed glochid parts with tweezers and then applying and ripping off household glue (like a "bikini wax") can almost entirely prevent inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Harvesting and Preparing Prickly Pear Fruit (Tuna)

[[Harvesting and preparing prickly pear fruit | Harvesting prickly pear fruit]] requires caution to avoid glochids.

*   **Harvesting**: Always use tongs to handle the fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Use a twisting motion, not pulling, to remove the fruit from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Glochid Removal from Fruit**: Even ripe fruits may still have many glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Washing/Scrubbing**: Some methods suggest scrubbing the fruit with a stiff brush under running water and rinsing multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This might work better for store-bought varieties that appear to have fewer glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   **Sand**: An ancient indigenous method is to vigorously roll the fruits in sand, theoretically dislodging the prickles, then washing them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   **Fire**: A traditional and effective method is to singe the fruit over a flame (e.g., a gas stove burner or campfire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. You can see glochids ignite and shrivel up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Do not keep them in the heat too long or they will burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. After flaming, wash them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Peeling**:
    *   Some suggest simply peeling the skin off with fingers after glochid removal, especially for larger store-bought fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Trimming the blossom and stem ends first can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, hold the fruit upright with a fork and fillet off the skin with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Consumption**: The fruit can be eaten raw by filleting the edible flesh off the seed core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. However, since there isn't much flesh and the seeds are hard, it's often juiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   Blend the peeled fruit with a little water to help with blending, then strain out the seeds and pulp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
    *   The juice can be boiled down to make candies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Stir in simple syrup and lime juice for *agua fresca de tuna* (a soft drink) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It can also be spiked with tequila for a cocktail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Preparing Nopales (Paddles)

[[Preparing nopales for consumption | Nopales]] also come with glochids and mucilage that need to be addressed.

*   **Glochid Removal from Paddles**: Similar to the fruit, paddles can be singed over fire to kill the glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. While you can shave them off with the skin, the glochids might get stuck in the sticky mucilage of the paddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Store-bought *nopales* often only have the large conspicuous thorns that can be easily shaved off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Managing Mucilage**:
    *   When eaten raw, the slime may not be bothersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   When cooked, the slime can become more unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. In Mexican cuisine, *nopales* are often boiled, then strained and washed to remove much of the slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Consumption**: Well-prepared *nopales* can make a very tasty taco filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

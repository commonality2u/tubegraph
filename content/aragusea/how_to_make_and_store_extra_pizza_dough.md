Making extra pizza dough is a common practice because it requires "basically the same amount of work to make four portions as it is to make one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This allows for [[experimenting_with_new_pizza_recipes_using_extra_dough | experimentation]] and provides convenient access to dough for various culinary creations.

## [[Pizza dough preparation | Dough Preparation and Initial Storage]]

The standard dough recipe involves kneading the dough, portioning it into individual oiled containers, and immediately placing it into the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This process facilitates a cold ferment, which can last for "many days, maybe a week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Retrieving Dough from the Fridge

When ready to use, gently pull the dough away from the edge of the container to lift it out, aiming to deflate it as little as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Freezing Leftover Dough

[[Preparing and handling pizza dough | Pizza dough]] freezes remarkably well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. For best results, freeze the dough after it has fully risen and is ready to bake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Freezing Process
*   **Container to Freezer**: A glass container holding risen dough can be transferred directly to the freezer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Dough is full of air, so it typically won't break glass containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Optimal Storage**: For better results, remove the dough from the glass container and wrap it in plastic wrap or place it in a freezer bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Shape for Quick Thawing**: If the dough is spread out "nice and flat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> and full of air bubbles, it will freeze and thaw quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Thawing Frozen Dough
*   **Counter Thawing**: Dough can thaw on the counter in approximately 30 to 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Thawing**: To speed up thawing, place the dough on aluminum, which is "extremely thermally conductive," and flip it halfway through once the side touching the metal feels soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This can thaw the dough in about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Yeast Viability**: Freezing may kill some yeast, but this is generally not an issue for flatbreads like pizza, as long as the dough was allowed to rise before freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Uses for Leftover Dough

Beyond making more pizza, leftover dough can be transformed into:
*   Garlic knots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Fried dough (dinner rolls or cinnamon sugar dessert) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
*   [[Recipe for homemade pizza bread | Pizza bread]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   [[Experimenting with new pizza recipes using extra dough | Experimenting with new recipes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> (e.g., summer squash pizza)

[[Best practices for pizza dough preparation | Experimenting with new recipes]] using extra dough is recommended, as it allows for trying "weird new pizza" without the disappointment of failure after putting in the work of making and [[aging pizza dough | fermenting dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

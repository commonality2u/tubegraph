From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Pork is considered a highly [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | polarizing meat]], possibly the most polarizing food globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While it accounts for over a third of global meat consumption, roughly a third of humanity avoids eating pigs, largely because it is seen as "inherently unclean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Islam strictly forbids pork, and Hinduism is generally not in favor of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Despite widespread avoidance, there is no clear scholarly consensus among anthropologists, archaeologists, and theologians regarding the historical origins of the [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | pork taboo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Scriptural References

### The Torah (Old Testament)
The [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | pork taboo]] is first codified in Abrahamic religious law within the Torah, specifically in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, written around the first millennium BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Ancient Jewish law states that pork is forbidden because pigs have a "cloven hoof but don't chew their cud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

*   **Cloven Hoof:** This refers to a hoof divided into multiple toes, like those of deer, cows, goats, and sheep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Chew their Cud (Ruminants):** Ruminant animals (like cows, goats, and sheep) can digest cellulose (the main structural bulk of most plants) by swallowing grass whole, fermenting it with gut bacteria, then regurgitating and re-chewing it to break it down further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Humans cannot digest cellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Pigs, despite having a cloven hoof, do not chew their cud; their digestive systems are very similar to humans, meaning they consume the same types of food as people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, the Torah does not explicitly state *why* these characteristics make pork forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### The Qur'an
The Qur'an states that "the flesh of swine is forbidden" unless one is starving to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This prohibition is listed alongside carrion (rotten meat, often from an animal that died on its own) and blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Both carrion and blood are particularly likely to harbor dangerous pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Theories on the Origins of the Taboo

### 19th Century Health and Safety [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | Theories]]
Many people interpret the listing of pork alongside carrion and blood in the Qur'an as an ancient health and safety code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

#### Trichinosis Theory
This [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | theory]] gained significant traction in the 19th century when scientists linked the parasitic disease trichinosis to roundworms found in undercooked pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. With trichinosis pervasive in 19th-century Europe and the Americas, intellectuals sought to reconcile religious teachings with new scientific knowledge, finding a "scientific logic" in the Old Testament prohibition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

#### Counterarguments to Health and Safety [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | Theories]]
More recent scholarship, including an influential book by American anthropologist Marvin Harris in the 1980s, casts doubt on the trichinosis [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

*   **Pork is Not Exceptional:** Harris argued there is "absolutely nothing exceptional about pork as a source of human disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. All domestic animals are potentially hazardous, and diseases like anthrax (a bacterial infection passed from cattle and sheep to humans) were likely more prevalent and observable in the ancient world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** There is no evidence that trichinosis was particularly pervasive in the ancient Middle East or that ancient people were aware of its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Meat parasites cause relatively mild illnesses, often asymptomatic, and serious problems can take years to unfold, making it difficult for ancient people to link them to meat consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The popularity of the trichinosis [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | theory]] is seen as a projection of 19th-century European and American experiences onto ancient peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Maimonides and Pig Cleanliness
One of the earliest specific arguments for the [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | pork taboo]] comes from Maimonides, a Sephardic Jewish rabbi and philosopher who served as Saladin's court physician in Egypt around 800 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Maimonides wrote that the principal reason for the prohibition was the pig's "very dirty and loathsome" habits and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. He argued that if pork were allowed, streets and houses would be filthier, as observed in the "country of the Franks" (Crusaders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Pigs are conspicuously perceived as gross because they eat anything—trash, roadkill, and even human excrement—and wallow in mud, potentially their own excrement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

#### Marvin Harris's Environmental Theory
Marvin Harris found this [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | theory]] most persuasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. He argued that pigs only resort to filth when humans give them no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

*   **Pigs in Forests:** In the ancient Middle East, which was once more forested, wild or domesticated pigs were not as "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They would root for seeds, nuts, and truffles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Wallowing for Cooling:** Pigs have no sweat glands and small lungs, making panting ineffective for shedding heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. In hot, sunny climates, wallowing in mud is their primary way to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Given the option, they prefer clean mud, but will wallow in their own excrement if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Deforestation and Urbanization:** As the Iron Age progressed, population growth in the Middle East led to deforestation and desertification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This forced pigs to wallow for cooling, and with urbanization, they were attracted to city dumps filled with food scraps and human waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Competition for Resources:** In this new context, pigs became both "gross and uneconomical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Unlike ruminants, pigs eat the same foods as humans, such as grains, leading to competition for resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. In less arid environments like ancient Rome or rapidly urbanizing China, pigs could clean streets and convert waste into protein without direct competition, making them favored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This shift in perception and practicality, Harris argued, led to the religious prohibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

#### Counterarguments to Harris's Theory
Despite its persuasiveness, Harris's [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | theory]] also faces counterarguments:

*   **Other "Gross" Animals:** Goats also eat "absolutely anything, including poop," yet Jews and Muslims have no religious opposition to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Chickens, whose coops can be as gross as pigsties and who also eat grains that humans could consume, are also not forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Chicken as a Replacement:** Recent scholarship, such as a 2015 paper by archaeologist Richard Redding, suggests that chickens may have simply supplanted pork in the Middle Eastern diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Chickens can live in cramped urban spaces and convert food scraps into protein more efficiently than pigs, produce eggs, and are smaller, allowing for entire animals to be cooked and eaten immediately in hot climates where meat spoils quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. If this were merely a matter of practicality, a religious prohibition might not have been necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Cultural Identity and Distinction
Archaeological evidence indicates that pig eating never completely ceased in the Middle East and was not limited to non-Israelites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This suggests that laws are typically made against behaviors that are occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Once the [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | pork taboo]] took hold, it clearly became a means for people to [[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | distinguish themselves]] from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   A recent paper suggests that the law in the Torah may have been a mechanism to assimilate Israelites from the northern kingdom, who were still eating pork, into the southern culture that eschewed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   Over time, the [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | pork taboo]] helped Israelites [[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | distinguish themselves]] from the Romans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   Later, it became a way for Muslims, who inherited the Abrahamic tradition, to [[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | distinguish themselves]] from groups like the "dirty Crusading Franks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

While the reasons for its spread and persistence are evident, the exact historical origin of the [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | pork taboo]] remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

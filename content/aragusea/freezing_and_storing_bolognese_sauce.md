[[making_bolognese_sauce | Bolognese sauce]] is ideal for making in large batches because it freezes exceptionally well, allowing for convenient future meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Freezing Methods

Once the prepared bolognese sauce has cooled down, it can be transferred into ice cube trays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This method simplifies portion control, making it easy to thaw out the exact amount needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Alternatively, the sauce can be frozen in a large plastic bin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

After the sauce cubes are frozen, typically overnight, they can be easily released from the trays by twisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The frozen cubes should then be transferred to a large ziplock bag for long-term storage in the freezer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Thawing and Reheating

To thaw and reheat frozen bolognese sauce, a common method is to place three cubes per person into a bowl and microwave until thawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Serving Tips for Thawed Sauce

After thawing, it's recommended to add a little more balsamic vinegar while the sauce is still hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This helps to brighten the flavor of the sauce after it has been frozen for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The heat of the sauce will cause the harsh scent of the vinegar to boil off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The reheated sauce can then be served over [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | pasta]], providing a deeply flavored, slow-simmered home-cooked meal in approximately 10 minutes, or however long it takes to boil the [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | pasta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Leftover unfrozen sauce can also be used for other dishes, such as lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

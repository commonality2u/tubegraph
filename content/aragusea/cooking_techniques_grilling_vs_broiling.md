Indian American restaurant-style tandoori chicken is well-suited for the home kitchen and can be prepared either on a [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] or under a [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Preparing the Chicken
Using only chicken legs is recommended as dark meat tastes better and is more forgiving, becoming "soft and sticky and delicious" without drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:50">[02:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>. Score the chicken legs with deep cuts down to the bone to help them cook faster and create more delicious surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. While different chicken parts can be used, cooking only one cut ensures they finish at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

For the marinade, layer ingredients directly onto the meat:
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>
*   Homemade masala (spice mixture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>
*   Kashmir chili powder for color and mild heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>
*   Bottled ginger garlic paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>
*   Juice of one lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a> (avoid excessive acid to prevent mushy texture if marinating for longer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>
*   Full-fat Greek yogurt (or curd) to create a thick paste without excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>
*   Optional: Red food coloring for the classic "candy apple red" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>

The chicken can be cooked immediately, but flavors intensify if marinated for a few hours, though not more than a day to prevent mushiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Grilling Method
A charcoal [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] is considered the best substitute for a tandoor, providing intense heat and smoky flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### Setup and Cooking
1.  **Charcoal**: Use natural chunk charcoal as it burns hotter than briquettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Light it using a chimney starter with paper towels and grease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Once glowing, dump it out and add a heavy layer of fresh charcoal to ensure enough fuel for cooking the chicken through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Grill Preparation**: Place the top grate on the [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] and wait five minutes for new charcoal to ignite and residual sludge to burn off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Clean the grate with a wire brush and grease it (e.g., with tongs and spray) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
3.  **Chicken Placement**: Place chicken on the [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]], ensuring no excess marinade drips to prevent flare-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
4.  **Heat Management**: Close the [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] lid immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Keep bottom vents wide open for air, and top vents half-closed for ideal airflow and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Keep the [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] covered to contain heat and bake the chicken's interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
5.  **Flipping and Monitoring**: After about five minutes, side one will be charred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Juggle pieces if the heat is uneven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Flip all pieces and cover again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. The coals will naturally die down, reducing heat for a slow-cook finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
6.  **Doneness**: Total cooking time is about 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. Check for clean bone and clear juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Dark meat should reach at least 170째F (77째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. If the fire dies, the chicken can be finished in an oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

### Grilled Vegetables (Optional)
While ideal to [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] vegetables, if the [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] fire isn't hot enough, use a cast iron pan on high heat with a little neutral oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Add thick-sliced onions and bell peppers, salt them, and cook briefly without moving them to get brown edges while keeping the interior almost raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

## Broiling Method
For those without a [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]], the [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]] (what Brits call a [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]]) is a viable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Setup and Cooking
1.  **Equipment**: Use a sheet pan with a rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Initial [[broiling_method_for_cookies | Broiling]]**: Place the chicken on the very top shelf, directly under the [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]] element, set to its hottest setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. This provides an intense heat level similar to a tandoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
3.  **Flipping**: After 10 minutes, the chicken should have a great char <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Flip the pieces and [[broiling_method_for_cookies | broil]] the second side for another 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
4.  **Baking Finish**: Turn off the [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]] and set the oven to bake at 350째F (175째C) or any moderate temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Move the chicken to the middle rack and continue baking for 15 minutes to "overcook" the dark meat, making it soft and sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
5.  **Drip Management**: If drippings in the tray burn and cause smoke, pour a little water into the tray under the rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

## Comparison and Conclusion
Both methods yield delicious tandoori chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. The oven [[broiling_method_for_cookies | broiling]] method offers easier heat control and results in more even color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. However, it lacks the smoky flavor imparted by a [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | grill]] or a traditional charcoal-fueled tandoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Adding smoke to oven-baked dishes
> A popular Indian [[cooking_techniques | technique]] involves igniting a single coal on the stovetop and placing it in a dish with ghee to fill the oven with smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

Making a large batch of tandoori chicken is recommended, as it can be used later for other dishes like chicken tikka masala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

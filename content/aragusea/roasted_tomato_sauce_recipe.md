This roasted tomato sauce recipe is ideal for [[using_garden_tomatoes_for_sauce | garden tomatoes]] in the summer, offering an intense, sweet, almost smoky, and roasted flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While canned tomatoes might be preferred most of the year, this particular sauce is designed to showcase the quality of fresh, homegrown tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | homemade tomato sauce]] is not well-suited for [[making_quick_tomato_sauce | making a big quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, as each tomato piece requires its own space to roast thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Preparation

### Equipment
*   Roasting pan or skillet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Wooden spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

### Ingredients
*   Tomatoes (preferably [[using_garden_tomatoes_for_sauce | garden tomatoes]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   Garlic cloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Shallots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Salt and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

### Optional Ingredients
*   Butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   Fresh basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   Cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>

## Method

1.  **Preheat Oven**: Crank the oven to 450°F (232°C), using convection if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Prepare Tomatoes**:
    *   Cut away any imperfections (e.g., pecked or bug-eaten parts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Cut all tomatoes at least in half, and larger ones into more pieces, aiming for roughly equal size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  **Arrange for Roasting**:
    *   Coat a pan with olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Arrange tomato chunks skin-side up in a single layer, ensuring each piece has its own space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Do not pile them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
4.  **First Roast**: Place the pan into the hot oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Roast for about 30 minutes until the skins are burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Burnt skins protect the flesh and are important for the [[roasting_technique_for_tomato_sauce | roasting technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
5.  **Continue Roasting**: Continue cooking until the liquid at the bottom of the pan has reduced and started to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This took an additional 15 minutes in the video, but times may vary based on the tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
6.  **Add Aromatics**: While the tomatoes are roasting, chop a few cloves of garlic and one or two shallots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Once the tomatoes are nearly done (liquid reduced and browned), add the chopped garlic and shallots to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Roast for another 4-5 minutes, ensuring they do not go darker than light brown on the bottom of the pan, as this indicates they are on the edge of burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
7.  **Remove Skins**:
    *   Most burnt skins should lift off easily like "little hats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   For skins that stick, especially on smaller pieces, shake the tomato flesh out of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   If some burnt skin bits remain, leave them; they will add a nice smoky note to the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
8.  **Mash and Deglaze**:
    *   Using a wooden spoon, mash the tomatoes directly in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   As liquid releases, use it to deglaze the pan, scraping up the deeply caramelized tomato juice stuck to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This combines the caramelized flavor with the fresh tomato flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Continue mashing and scraping; the residual heat will finish cooking any remaining garlic and shallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
9.  **Season**: Add salt and pepper to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The sauce can be pureed for a smooth consistency, or left chunky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Optional Additions

*   **Butter**: Melt in some butter using the residual heat of the pan, keeping the temperature low to prevent separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This creates a thick, glossy emulsion with a flavor akin to an Italian version of Indian butter chicken gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Basil**: Tear in fresh basil at the last second to keep it fresh and green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Cheese**: Grate a little cheese over the top when serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Serving

This sauce is excellent for [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | pasta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. When adding pasta, include some of the cooking water to adjust consistency if the sauce seems too thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Tips and Variations

*   This recipe is best when the tomatoes' flavor is allowed to shine through "virtually unadulterated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   The sauce highlights everything fresh tomatoes can do, from bright sweetness to deep umami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Other [[optional_ingredients_for_tomato_sauce | ingredients]] like roasted carrots or white wine at the deglazing stage have been tried, but often the simple method is preferred to let the tomatoes be the star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Roasting shallots whole with tomatoes made the sauce too sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

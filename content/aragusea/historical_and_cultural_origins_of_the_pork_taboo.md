Pork is considered by some to be the most polarizing meat, and possibly the most polarizing food globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While it accounts for over a third of global meat consumption, about a third of humanity [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | studiously avoids eating pigs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This avoidance is often rooted in the belief that pork is "inherently unclean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Despite extensive debate among anthropologists, archaeologists, and theologians, there is no clear scholarly consensus on the historical origins of the pork taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Religious Prohibitions

[[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | Islam strictly forbids eating pork]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | Hinduism is generally not favorable towards it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The earliest codified [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | pork taboo in Abrahamic religious law]] appears in the Torah, specifically in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, written in the first millennium BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Ancient Jewish law states pork is forbidden because pigs have a cloven hoof but do not chew their cud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Cloven Hoof**: Refers to a hoof divided into multiple toes, like a deer, cow, goat, or sheep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Chewing the Cud**: This describes ruminants (like cows, goats, and sheep) that can digest cellulose (the main structural bulk of plants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. They swallow grass, allow gut bacteria to ferment it, then regurgitate and chew it further before re-swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Humans and pigs cannot digest cellulose and have similar digestive systems, consuming similar foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The Torah does not explain *why* these characteristics make pork bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The Qur'an also forbids the flesh of swine, along with carrion and blood, unless one is starving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Theories on the Pork Taboo's Origins

### [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | Health and Safety Code Theory]]

Many people infer from the Qur'an's list (carrion, blood, swine) that the prohibition was an ancient [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | health and safety code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | theory gained traction in the 19th century]] when scientists linked [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]], a parasitic disease, to roundworms in undercooked pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The prevalence of [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]] in 19th-century Europe and the Americas made this scientific explanation appealing for reconciling religious teachings with new scientific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

However, more recent scholarship casts doubt on the [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Anthropologist Marvin Harris's Critique**: In his influential 1980s book on meat taboos, Harris argued there is "absolutely nothing exceptional about pork as a source of human disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. All domestic animals can be hazardous to human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Ancient Evidence**: There is no evidence that [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis was particularly pervasive in the ancient Middle East]], nor that ancient Middle Easterners were aware of its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. In contrast, there's evidence that ancient people knew about anthrax, which may be referenced in the Book of Exodus and Homer's *Iliad* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Difficulty of Causal Link**: Meat parasites cause mild illnesses, often asymptomatic, with serious problems unfolding over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It would have been difficult for ancient people to link meat consumption to such parasitic diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Modern Projection**: Harris concludes that the [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | trichinosis theory]] is a case of modern people projecting their 19th-century experiences onto ancient societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Dirtiness and Economic Inefficiency Theory (Marvin Harris)

One of the earliest explicit arguments for the pork taboo comes from the medieval philosopher Maimonides (12th century), who served as Saladin's court physician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. He wrote:
> "The principal reason why the law forbids swine's flesh is to be found in the circumstances that its habits and its foods are very dirty and loathsome. If it were allowed to eat swine's flesh, the streets and houses would be dirtier than any cesspool, as may be seen in the country of the Franks." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

Indeed, pigs are notably "gross" compared to most farm animals: they eat trash, roadkill, and even human excrement, and wallow in mud or their own waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

Harris's theory suggests that pigs only resort to such filthy habits when humans leave them no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Pigs in Forests**: In ancient Middle Eastern forests, pigs would root for seeds, nuts, and truffles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. They also wallow in mud for cooling, as they lack sweat glands and have small lungs, making panting inefficient for heat regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Given the option, they prefer clean mud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Environmental Changes and Urbanization**: The Iron Age saw population growth in the Middle East, leading to deforestation and desertification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This forced pigs to wallow for coolness and attracted them to urban waste (food scraps, human excrement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. As people increasingly saw pigs in this unflattering context, pork became viewed as inherently unclean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Competition for Food**: Unlike ruminants, pigs cannot eat grass and compete with humans for grains and other foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In the arid Middle East, pigs became both "gross and uneconomical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. In contrast, in less arid environments like ancient Rome, pigs cleaned streets and converted waste into protein without competing with humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This "natural synergy" also made pork popular in urbanizing China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Harris argues the religious prohibitions followed this "double whammy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Chicken Replacement Theory (Richard Redding)

Archaeologist Richard Redding (2015 paper) proposes a counter-argument to Harris's theory, suggesting chickens may have simply supplanted pork in the Middle Eastern diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Chickens can live in cramped urban spaces and convert food scraps into protein, similar to pigs, but more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Additional Products**: Chickens also produce eggs, which pigs do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Portion Size and Preservation**: Chickens are smaller, allowing for a single animal to be slaughtered, cooked, and consumed immediately, a significant advantage in hot climates where meat spoils quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Supplantation**: Redding argues that chickens were better suited to the Middle East than pigs and, upon their later arrival, simply supplanted pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, this theory raises the question of why a religious prohibition would be needed if people would naturally favor the more efficient option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## [[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | Cultural Identity and Dietary Distinctions]]

Recent archaeological findings indicate that pig eating never completely ceased in the Middle East and was not limited to non-Israelites like the Philistines; ancient Jews in some regions also consumed pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This suggests that "nobody makes laws against things that nobody is doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Once the [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | pork taboo]] became established, it served as a means for people to [[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | distinguish themselves from others]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Internal Assimilation**: For instance, evidence suggests that Israelite migrants from the northern kingdom, who likely ate pork, were assimilated into the southern culture that eschewed pork around the 7th century BCE, with the Torah's law possibly acting as a mechanism for this assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **External Distinction**: Over time, the [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | pork taboo]] helped the Israelites differentiate themselves from the Romans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Later, Muslims adopted this Abrahamic tradition to distinguish themselves from groups like the "dirty crusading Franks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

While the exact origin of the [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | pork taboo]] remains uncertain, its spread and persistence are easily understood, influencing dietary practices and cultural identity to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

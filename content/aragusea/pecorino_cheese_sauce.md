From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

A key component of a multi-day lasagna recipe, this pecorino cheese sauce is designed to be the primary source of salt and acidity for the entire dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. It's deliberately made "too salty" to balance the other flavors in the lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>
*   1 stick of butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>
*   1 whole head of garlic, chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>
*   Up to 1 cup of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>
*   1/2 gallon of milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>
*   7 oz block of Pecorino cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>
*   Salt, to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>

## Preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>

1.  **Melt Butter & Add Garlic**: Melt a stick of butter in a large pan over medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. While it melts, chop a whole head of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Make a Roux**: Whisk in enough flour (no more than a cup) to the melted butter to create a thick paste, forming a roux that will thicken the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Add the chopped garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Incorporate Milk**: Gradually whisk in half a gallon of milk, a little at a time, to prevent sloshing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
4.  **Cool & Add Cheese**: Once all the milk is incorporated, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool until it stops bubbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Grate the entire 7-ounce block of Pecorino cheese directly into the cooled sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Adding cheese while the sauce is boiling will make it grainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
5.  **Whisk & Season**: Whisk the cheese into the sauce; it doesn't need to be perfectly smooth as it will melt completely in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Taste and add more salt, making it intentionally too salty to serve as the primary source of salt for the entire lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Usage in Lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>
This cheese sauce is used as an alternating layer with [[nontraditional_bolognese_sauce | non-traditional bolognese sauce]] and homemade pasta in a lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. It helps if the cheese sauce is warm when spreading to ensure a thin, even layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

### Cheese Selection
Pecorino cheese is preferred over Parmesan due to the acidity of sheep's milk cheese, which "cuts better" through the sauce and brightens the overall flavors in the lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

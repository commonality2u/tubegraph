The spice mixture, or *masala* in Hindi, is a crucial component for making Indian American restaurant-style tandoori chicken at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Key Ingredient: Kashmir Chili Powder

A key ingredient for tandoori chicken is Kashmir chili powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This specific chili powder provides a beautiful red color without overwhelming the dish with heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It can often be found at Indo-Pak grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

If Kashmir chili powder is unavailable, a combination of cayenne pepper (for heat) and paprika (for color) can be used as a substitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The amount used should result in mild to moderate heat for Western palates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Food coloring can also be added for a "candy apple red" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Homemade Masala vs. Premade

While a premade *garam masala* mixture can be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, preparing a homemade masala by toasting and grinding whole spices is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This not only results in a better taste but is also more convenient for infrequent cooks, as whole spices have a much longer shelf life compared to pre-ground masalas which can lose flavor quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A simplified homemade masala can be superior to a more elaborate store-bought one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Even a basic blend using just cumin, coriander, and cardamom (the "three C's") can provide an authentic Indian food flavor profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Whole Spice Ingredients

The foundational spices for a homemade masala include:
*   Cumin seeds (1 tablespoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Coriander seeds (1 tablespoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Black peppercorns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Black cardamom pods (4 pods, noted as stronger than green ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Fenugreek seeds (1 teaspoon, optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Cinnamon stick (half a stick, broken with scissors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

### Preparation of Homemade Masala

The whole spices are toasted on medium-high heat in a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Toasting continues until they become fragrant and tiny wisps of smoke are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While some Indian cooks toast spices one by one for specific timing, this method combines them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

After toasting, the spices are ground in a dedicated coffee grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It may be necessary to dislodge larger pieces to ensure thorough grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Application to Chicken

When [[preparing_tandoori_chicken_at_home | preparing tandoori chicken]], the spices are added directly to the meat, rather than mixing them into a paste beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This allows for eyeballing the amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. First, salt is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, followed by a heavy but not excessive dusting of the homemade masala. Too much can result in a powdery, pasty texture on the finished chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Finally, the Kashmir chili powder is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

This spice mixture is then combined with other ingredients like lemon juice, bottled ginger-garlic paste, and full-fat Greek yogurt to form the [[marinating_chicken_for_tandoori | marinade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

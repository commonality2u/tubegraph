## Defining Alcoholic Beverages and Ethanol

Broadly defined, liquor is any alcoholic beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While different governments have varying definitions, an alcoholic beverage can be considered anything drinkable that contains at least one or two percent ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Ethanol is the specific type of alcohol consumed for recreational purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its chemical structure consists of two carbon atoms bonded to several hydrogen atoms, all of which are attached to a hydroxyl groupâ€”an oxygen atom bonded to a hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Drinks with less than approximately one percent ethanol are virtually impossible to become intoxicated by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>; for example, most fruit juices found in grocery stores contain about half a percent ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Most beverages recognized as alcoholic generally contain at least a few percentage points of ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Production and Biological Limits

In traditionally made beer or wine, there is a biological ceiling on the maximum ethanol content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. These beverages are produced by introducing [[fermentation_process_and_biological_limits_of_yeast | yeast]] to a sweet, nutrient-rich liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The [[fermentation_process_and_biological_limits_of_yeast | yeast]] metabolizes the liquid, and ethanol is among the byproducts they produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Ethanol's Toxicity

Ethanol is a poison, even when consumed in moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. In high concentrations, ethanol damages proteins and cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Depending on the type of [[fermentation_process_and_biological_limits_of_yeast | yeast]] and other factors, [[fermentation_process_and_biological_limits_of_yeast | yeast]] typically cannot survive when the ethanol content reaches the teens (percentage by volume) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This biological limit explains why beer and wine usually max out their alcohol content in the teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

For beverages with higher alcohol content, the ethanol must be extracted and refined from the fermented product, a process known as [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Congeners and Methanol

When ethanol is [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distilled]], other volatile substances, known as congeners, can also evaporate at low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. These can include non-poisonous compounds like tannins and esters, which contribute to the flavor of the finished spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

However, congeners also include "fusel alcohols" (German for "bad liquor"), which are alcohols other than ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The most notable of these is methanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Methanol is structurally similar to ethanol but has only one carbon atom instead of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. As little as 10 milliliters of methanol can permanently destroy the optic nerve, causing blindness, and 30 milliliters can be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

Fortunately, methanol is slightly more volatile than ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, meaning most of it vaporizes and comes through the [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | still]] at the beginning of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Distillers typically discard this initial portion, known as the "head cuts" or "foreshot," because of its poisonous content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The "heart cuts," the purest ethanol, come next, followed by the "tail cuts" at the end, which also contain undesirable congeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

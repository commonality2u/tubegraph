Impostor syndrome is characterized by a feeling that one's achievements are not due to their own abilities, but rather to external factors or the contributions of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Individuals experiencing this often attribute their success to being "carried" by the people around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Experience of Impostor Syndrome

When told they are doing well or performing admirably, individuals with impostor syndrome tend to believe it is not genuinely due to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This can manifest as:
*   **Attributing success to others:** The belief that accomplishments are a result of being surrounded by talented people who "carry" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. An analogy is being a "new band" surrounded by "pro players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Minimizing personal effort:** Viewing one's own work ethic as merely "basic" or "regular" performance, rather than something exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **High "evasion rate for appreciation":** Actively deflecting compliments or positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Even when it is "nice to hear," the person may feel "zero credit" or "not that much happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This rejection of praise can be an "instant rejection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## Impact on Self-Perception

Impostor syndrome deeply affects an individual's [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | sense of self-value and intrinsic worth]]. It can lead to:
*   **Self-perception as "less than":** Individuals may perceive themselves as less capable or valuable than how others see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Difficulty defining self:** A lack of clear self-definition, where one doesn't "really know" how they think about themselves, but are certain of how they *don't* see themselves (e.g., not resilient) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This can be exacerbated if one has largely existed "in relation to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

### Connection to External Validation
The need for external metrics, such as "numbers" in an industry, can further complicate one's [[struggles_with_selfworth_and_selfesteem | self-worth]] if they struggle with impostor syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. However, some individuals find that these numbers become "hollow" over time, leading them to prioritize personal happiness and enjoyment of their work over quantitative success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.

### Psychological Mechanisms
The "dodging" of appreciation can be seen as a form of [[psychological_effects_of_rejection_and_cognitive_biases | cognitive bias]], where positive input is consistently filtered or dismissed because it doesn't align with an internal, lower self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

[!NOTE] The individual's primary self-perception of being a "support" player who helps others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, trying to "make everyone happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, contrasts with the idea of taking credit for their own achievements.

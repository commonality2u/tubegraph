Dr. K, a psychiatrist who previously studied to become a monk, discusses how to prevent [[tips_on_conserving_motivational_energy | motivation from leaking away]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Introverts naturally possess an advantage in [[strategies_for_cultivating_internal_motivation_and_discipline | cultivating motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Secret Mantra Principle

The understanding of how to [[strategies_for_cultivating_internal_motivation_and_discipline | cultivate motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> can be traced back to India, where Dr. K studied with a Tantric Guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He was initiated into a secret mantra with the instruction to keep it secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The Guru stated that telling anyone the mantra would diminish its power, but chanting and cultivating it internally would make its power grow, leading to material and spiritual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Dr. K observed increased success in his own life after practicing this, and continues to chant the mantra without revealing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Scientific Basis: Venting Energy

This principle is also scientifically supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. In psychotherapy, when traumatized individuals vent their trauma, the energy within them diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. As negative emotions and shame are vocalized externally in a non-judgmental space, their power to control the individual's life diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Psychotherapy aims to take internal negativity and have it vocalized externally, thereby diminishing its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Conversely, a mantra works in the exact opposite way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. With a mantra, something positive is cultivated internally and is *not* vented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This compounds positive internal energy, which is theorized to lead to positive changes in one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Impact of Vocalizing Plans on Motivation

This concept directly relates to [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation leaking out]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. When people talk about what they are going to do, especially on social media, they often diminish their internal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   **External Reinforcement**: When individuals announce their intentions (e.g., "I'm going to be a doctor") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, they often receive positive external reinforcement, such as praise or impressiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Reinforcing Talking, Not Doing**: This external reward reinforces the act of talking about something, rather than actually doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The reward is received without any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Motivation Leakage**: As a result, the [[impact_of_vocalizing_plans_on_motivation | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> to follow through begins to leak away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is observed in various contexts, such as gamers who spend time theory-crafting and arguing online instead of playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The more one vents about their intentions, the less motivated and successful they tend to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Introverts, being less inclined to talk about what they do, often find success because they store internal energy and channel it into action instead of language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Language as a Substitute for Action

Sigmund Freud discovered that language can serve as a substitute for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For example, talking to a deceased loved one's grave serves as a substitute for actions one wished to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This principle, borne out in psychotherapy studies, highlights that language and action are intrinsically linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Yogis also understood that both language and action originate from the same pool of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This explains why there are typically "talkers" and "doers," but rarely individuals who excel at both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For instance, there are entrepreneurs who run companies and professors of entrepreneurship who teach about starting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Practical Strategies for Conserving Motivational Energy

To prevent [[tips_on_conserving_motivational_energy | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> from leaking away, consider the following:

1.  **Monitor Your Speech**: Pay attention to how often you talk about what you want to do and observe the inverse relationship between talking and acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
2.  **Reflect on Past Actions**: Think about times you've successfully completed something; chances are you talked about it less beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. For example, simply starting to go to the gym rather than talking to many people about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
3.  **Limit Public Disclosure**: "Shut the hell up," especially on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. If you have a goal, avoid telling anyone to keep that energy internal and prevent it from venting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Journaling and Re-Internalization

If you vent something, you need to re-internalize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Journaling**: While journaling can help vent negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, if you're journaling about positive aspirations, you should reread it to bring that energy back internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Mantras**: Similarly, listening to mantras being chanted can help re-internalize their effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Intentional Communication

It is acceptable to talk to people, but it must be intentional, scoped, and purposeful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Avoid random conversations where people merely talk about ideas without action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Recognize that every word spoken can deplete your [[tips_on_conserving_motivational_energy | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, so conversations should only occur when the benefit clearly outweighs this cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

By keeping positive goals and aspirations internal, allowing them to compound and build pressure, you can then channel that energy into action instead of words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

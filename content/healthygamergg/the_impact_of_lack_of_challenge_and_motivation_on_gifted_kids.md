The perception of a gifted child is often one of inherent advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, in experience, being gifted can frequently be a burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Gifted children are, in essence, "special needs children" because their needs differ from those of an average child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Society often unintentionally sets these children up for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, leading to a pathway from giftedness to [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | burnout]] and [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | perfectionism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## How Society and Education Affect Gifted Children

### Lack of Study Habits Development

A significant disadvantage for [[the_challenges_faced_by_gifted_children | gifted children]] is that school tends to be easy for them at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This ease means they "get by without the luxury of studying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. While seemingly an advantage, being intelligent as a child can paradoxically set them up for failure later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> because they never develop habituated study techniques needed for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The school system is designed with a graduated sense of increasing responsibility, where students progressively learn to study more over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Gifted children often skip this skill-building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, getting by with minimal or no study through elementary years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. They eventually "hit a wall" when their raw intellect is no longer sufficient for the schoolwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This sudden struggle, coupled with their ingrained reliance on intellect, can lead to [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | perfectionism]] and [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### The Burden of Expectation

[[the_educational_and_societal_expectations_on_gifted_kids | Gifted children]] are often told from a young age that they are "gifted," "smart," and have "so much potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This creates a very lofty goal in their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. There's a societal assumption that being gifted means things should be easier, requiring less work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. However, living up to a gifted child's potential actually involves *more* work, akin to building a mansion compared to a shack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

This gap between external and internal expectations and the reality of the effort required leads to [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | gifted kids]] feeling like they are failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. They may put in the same amount of work as peers, expecting a "mansion" level outcome, but only achieve a "shack" equivalent in terms of progress on a larger goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This leads to confusion and a feeling of inferiority, especially when external comparisons are made ("Why is the kid next door getting into college and you're not?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Since being average is not enough for a gifted child, they set out to build a "mansion," leading to disappointment when their efforts yield less visible progress than others' simpler goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Shame and Low Self-Esteem

The compounding effect of high expectations and perceived underperformance creates a "shame gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. When [[the_educational_and_societal_expectations_on_gifted_kids | gifted children]] fall short of their expectations, shame fills this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This shame further hinders [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation]] and contributes to [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Gifted children develop an ego tied to their "smart kid" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This identity leads to avoidance of opportunities perceived as below them (e.g., community college), as it would mean "relegating yourself to being a stupid kid" and shattering their strongest perceived strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The shame and ego reside in this gap between their perceived identity and their current reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Comparison as a Core Problem

The very word "gifted" implies a comparative framework; it has no meaning outside of comparison to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This leads to [[the_challenges_faced_by_gifted_children | gifted children]] constantly comparing themselves, whether it's to peers, siblings, or societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Their expectations are often artificial, based on these comparisons rather than on their own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. This comparative framework can doom them to failure, as one cannot effectively base their life's expectations on what someone else is doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_supporting_gifted_children | Strategies for Supporting Gifted Children]]

### 1. Stop Comparison

The fundamental step to overcoming these [[challenges_faced_by_smart_individuals | challenges]] is to stop comparing oneself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Since the concept of "gifted" is inherently comparative, letting go of this comparative mindset is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### 2. Recognize the Long Road

[[the_challenges_faced_by_gifted_children | Gifted children]] must understand that their path will likely be a long and challenging one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The greater one's potential, the longer it will take to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. This means not expecting faster progress or immediate results; a "mansion" takes significantly longer to build than a "shack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Early efforts may yield less visible returns compared to peers, which can shatter [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Patience and a refusal to compare are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

### 3. Address Shame Through Acceptance

The [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | shame and low self-esteem]] in gifted individuals stem from the gap between high expectations and actual accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. To eliminate this "shame gap," one can either work harder to meet expectations or, more effectively, lower expectations through acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. Accepting oneself as they are, without viewing potential as wasted, can dissolve shame and unlock true capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

Practicing acceptance involves actively challenging expectations. An exercise for this is to let go of expectations in everyday situations, such as asking a waiter to surprise you with a meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This helps to understand that disappointment often arises from unmet expectations, not necessarily from the reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

### 4. For Parents, Teachers, and Managers: Challenge More, Not Less

When a gifted child is failing, the tendency is to slow down, but the appropriate response is often to speed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. They need a bigger challenge, not an easier environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. This doesn't apply if there are underlying issues like [[developmental_impact_of_adhd | ADHD]], depression, or learning disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. However, in their absence, it's crucial to challenge them more, ask them to do more, and place them in positions of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

For example, a gifted child addicted to video games might be seeking the pace and challenge games provide that school does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Games perfectly match a player's challenge level, unlike school, which moves at the pace of the slowest person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. Providing real-world challenges, such as a demanding internship, can turn them around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. It's about having faith in their capabilities and pushing them to try, even if they might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

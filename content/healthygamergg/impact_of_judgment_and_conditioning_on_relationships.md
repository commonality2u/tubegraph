From: [[healthygamergg]] <br/> 

An individual described a struggle with feeling that "everyone is stupid except me" and becoming "pissed off by everyone" due to perceiving them as "dumb and a bad influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective has led to significant loneliness and depression, despite efforts to improve finances, fitness, and studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The individual desires deep philosophical discussions but finds others uninterested or riddled with logical fallacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Parental Conditioning and its Effects
The individual's challenges in forming relationships are deeply rooted in their [[impact_of_childhood_and_upbringing_on_mental_health_and_behaviors | upbringing]] and family dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Parental Influence on Judgment
The mother, despite being "amazing and cared so much," consistently expressed upset and anger about the individual spending time with "dumb kids" in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This conditioned the individual to be judgmental, teaching them that potential friends were "not good enough" or "going to hold you back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The mother's continuous advice to stop associating with people based on their problems reinforced the idea of rejecting others due to perceived flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Modeling Relationship Dysfunction
The father, described as "incredibly smart and very successful," also suffers from having "absolutely no friends" and is difficult to live with due to anger issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The individual has "bad memories" of the father getting upset for not understanding things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This directly modeled a lack of relationship-forming skills and an environment where anger was prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. The individual fears following the father's footsteps despite swearing not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Problem of Loneliness and Judgment
Feeling "very smart" can be incredibly isolating, leading to difficulties in meeting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This often results in immense isolation and loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Loneliness as a Protective Mechanism
The brain can use loneliness as a protective mechanism. If someone feels stuck in a situation where they are lonely and cannot make friends, it often means something else is going on beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. For individuals with [[impact_of_selfesteem_and_selfworth_on_dating | self-esteem]] issues, loneliness can lead to a "reject you before you reject me" defense mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Internalizing and Projecting Flaws
A key insight is that "we hate in others that which we cannot fix in ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The individual's rejection of "functioning alcoholics who waste their money" mirrors their own past "alcoholic phase" and "throwing money away" due to peer pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This is a survival mechanism where the brain learns to steer clear of past harmful experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

This phenomenon can manifest as:
*   **Projection:** Attributing one's own undesirable traits or feelings to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Displacement:** Taking anger or frustration felt towards oneself and directing it towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Reaction Formation:** Expressing the opposite of one's true feelings, often seen in individuals who strongly hate something they secretly identify with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## The Desire for Connection and Respect
The individual's desire for deep philosophical discussions is not just about knowledge, but a longing for connection, challenge, and ultimately, respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. They want to "challenge other people and for that person to live up to the challenge and in turn to be challenged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

However, relationships are a two-way street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. It's important to consider what the other person wants from a relationship and to engage with them even if their desires don't perfectly align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. [[the_impact_of_beliefs_on_perceptions_and_relationships | Mutual respect]] is crucial for friendship, and judgment hinders this by preventing genuine respect for the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## Overcoming Judgment and Conditioning
To overcome these challenges and foster meaningful relationships, several steps can be taken:

### 1. Self-Awareness and Conditioning
The first step is looking at one's [[role_of_selfawareness_in_overcoming_judgmental_attitudes | conditioning]] and understanding where these [[the_impact_of_beliefs_on_perceptions_and_relationships | beliefs]] and judgments originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Recognizing that certain thoughts are conditioned responses is the "lion's share" of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. This insight is critical for behavioral changes to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

### 2. Addressing Internal Problems
While it's wise to choose environments that support personal growth (e.g., avoiding active users when trying to get sober) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, relying solely on surrounding oneself with "the opposite" of one's flaws will not fix deep-seated internal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. These issues need to be "internally fixed in a supportive environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

### 3. Challenging [[Cognitive biases and their impact | Cognitive Biases]]
Be cautious of the mind looking for ways to dismiss people, especially those who might offer what is desired, out of fear of being perceived as "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Subconscious rejection or mental gymnastics to "knock them down a peg" can prevent genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### 4. Rewiring Neural Pathways
Conditioning creates "game trails" in the brainâ€”well-grooved neural pathways that are easy to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. To change [[understanding and changing relationship patterns | relationship patterns]], one must consciously choose the "hard path" and create new neural pathways by repeatedly engaging in desired behaviors, even when it requires more effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Over time, these new paths become easier, leading to reconditioning and lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

Ultimately, even those who feel they are "smarter than everyone else" are deserving of compassion, and by addressing the underlying [[effects_of_a_traumatic_upbringing_on_relationships | traumatic upbringing]], conditioning, and internal fears, it is possible to overcome loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

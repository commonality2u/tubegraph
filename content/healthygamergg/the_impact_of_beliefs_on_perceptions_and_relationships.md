Many individuals struggle to find a relationship, even when they believe they deserve one, often feeling that factors outside their control are preventing them from having it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often leads to questions about whether common advice for finding love actually works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. While there is no shortage of advice available online from various sources like YouTube, Reddit, and advice forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, a key missing component is the timeline for when this advice will yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## The Cycle of Working on Oneself

Motivated individuals seeking relationships often collect information and research, receiving advice to "work on yourself," "don't try too hard," "just be yourself," or "be the best version of yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The idea is that if you focus on yourself, the relationship will come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, people often dedicate significant time (six months, a year, or even two years) to self-improvement—getting in shape, receiving promotions, or attending therapy—without finding a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This can lead to discouragement, despair, and doubt about the efficacy of the advice, as there seems to be no payoff or "win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The fundamental issue is that no one explains how long this process takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## [[the_concept_of_core_beliefs_in_relationships | Core Beliefs]] and Samskaras

To understand why this happens, it's crucial to grasp how belief structures form and how information is disseminated online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Formation of Beliefs
Our brains simplify experiences and form conclusions, creating "formulas" to navigate the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For example, a child frequently yelled at may conclude "I'm a bad person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This belief can be adaptive, as conforming to negative expectations may reduce emotional pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. These deep-seated conclusions become [[the_concept_of_core_beliefs_in_relationships | core beliefs]], or *samskaras* as called by yogis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Impact on Thoughts, Emotions, and Perceptions
[[the_concept_of_core_beliefs_in_relationships | Core beliefs]] generate adaptations, leading to assumptions and rules for living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. These rules then spawn "automatic thoughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. For instance, if a partner doesn't text back immediately, the automatic thought might be, "She doesn't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Yogis describe *samskaras* similarly: undigested emotional experiences sink down and lie dormant, ready to be triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. When triggered, the thoughts and emotions associated with that past experience are applied to the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This is what's commonly referred to as "relationship baggage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. For example, if a past partner's delayed texts indicated an affair, the current partner's similar behavior might trigger thoughts of cheating, even without present justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The distrust originates internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

When entering the dating pool, understanding your beliefs is vital: Do you believe you can find someone? Are you lovable, worthy, and deserving of a good relationship? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Beyond these, "intermediate beliefs" like concepts of "sexual marketplace value" can arise as adaptive beliefs to compensate for fears like being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

A critically undervalued piece of information is that [[the_concept_of_core_beliefs_in_relationships | core beliefs]] don't just shape thoughts; they profoundly shape perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. If you believe you are unlovable, you will amplify particular negative signals and reduce positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. For instance, if you have a 50/50 experience (one person interested, another not texting back), your mind will focus more on the negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This [[cognitive_biases_and_their_impact | cognitive bias]] explains why it can feel like success never happens, as positive information is filtered out and negative information is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### The Internet's Amplification
The internet exacerbates this problem by amplifying negative information and reducing positive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Online communities for relationships are typically dominated by people struggling, not those in healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Posts about successful relationships are often downvoted as bragging or arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. This creates a skewed perception that makes finding love seem impossible, even though many people do find partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

## The Missing Timeline and the Role of Patience
The key missing piece of relationship advice is the timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. People are told what to do but not how long it will take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This lack of expectation leads to quitting prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Just as one wouldn't expect a fruit tree to bear fruit within a year of planting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, or a college degree to yield a job immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, finding a relationship often requires years of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

While the exact duration is individualized, it can take three, four, five, or even seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. For those with no social skills and stagnant lives, at least five years of consistent self-improvement (working on social skills, becoming professionally and financially independent, taking care of physical and mental health) is a reasonable expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

Setting a long-term target, like five years, helps manage expectations; you won't anticipate immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Interestingly, relationships are most likely to happen when you're not actively expecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, often when focusing on being cool or just hanging out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Being "oblivious" and "out of your own head" is beneficial because internal anxiety (worrying about self-presentation, not empathically connecting) can be off-putting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This internal focus makes it hard to be present and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

Therefore, advice like "focus on yourself," "put yourself out there," and "give it time" is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. The early years are about leveling up rather than expecting immediate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## Managing Resentment
Any resentment or hopelessness about the dating process is justified and needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. When resentment enters the dating sphere, it can lead to self-sabotage, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy that reinforces [[the_concept_of_core_beliefs_in_relationships | core beliefs]] like "people don't care about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Projecting resentment makes it difficult for others to fall in love with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. These emotions should be managed externally through avenues like therapy, coaching, talking to friends, or venting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## Coaching vs. Therapy for Goal Achievement
Traditional therapy often focuses on diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, panic attacks, marriage counseling for existing relationships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. Therapists are typically trained not to take responsibility for patient outcomes; instead, they might ask questions to help patients explore their own challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

Coaching, on the other hand, is goal-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. It helps individuals achieve specific goals, such as finding a romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. Coaching works to dismantle [[the_concept_of_core_beliefs_in_relationships | samskaras]] and process past emotions like resentment that hinder dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Coaches help individuals understand their values, motivations, roadblocks, and goals, then develop a path to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. This includes understanding self-sabotage and how to set effective boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Peer support services and coaching can lead to clinical improvements in depression and anxiety by helping individuals achieve life goals, rather than directly treating the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. This continuous feedback and iteration allow coaching programs to improve their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

"Gooning" is a relatively new phenomenon, described as min-maxing the act of masturbation to achieve maximal pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It involves a "goon cave" setup with multiple monitors and specific sensory elements like incense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The practice centers on "edging," where an individual increases stimulation without reaching orgasm, then slows down, aiming to prolong and intensify the sexual experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

While a recent internet trend, gooning is seen as another example of humans figuring out how to exploit their own internal biological systems, much like the development of highly processed foods or addictive video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Masturbation

Historically, attitudes towards masturbation have varied significantly:

*   **1600s:** Some views suggested masturbation could strengthen the penis in young boys, making them better able to procreate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **1800s:** A strong anti-masturbation sentiment emerged, notably influenced by Swiss doctor Tissot, whose 1839 medical text described severe negative symptoms associated with "venereal excess" (masturbation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Symptoms of "Onanism" (Masturbation) according to Tissot:
> *   **Physical:** Loss of flesh and strength, consumption-like symptoms, pale/yellowish complexion, bluish circles around eyes, puffy eyelids, soft/flaccid flesh, small/feeble pulse, profuse perspiration on forehead, chest, and palms, swollen hands and feet, general muscle weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This description has been likened to a "sweaty nerd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
> *   **Mental/Emotional:** Suffering of heart and mind, taciturnity, avoiding gaze, love of solitude, embarrassment, shame, sadness, ennui, restlessness, fatigue, regret, and remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This has been compared to the symptomatology of an "Internet troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

> It's important to note that, in 1839, these descriptions primarily referred to boys and men, as the medical community did not yet fully acknowledge female masturbation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Neuroscience and Physiology of Sexual Pleasure

The sexual system uniquely combines both the **parasympathetic nervous system** (rest and digest) and the **sympathetic nervous system** (fight or flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

*   **Erection/Engorgement:** The parasympathetic system is crucial for increasing blood flow, leading to erection in males and clitoral vasodilation in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Once erect, the sympathetic nervous system activates, closing one-way valves to trap blood, maintaining the erection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Orgasm Threshold:** This is the critical point of stimulation needed to achieve orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   **Lowered Threshold:** If an individual has not had sex for a while, the threshold decreases, making it easier and faster to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   **Raised Threshold:** Medications like SSRIs can raise this threshold, making it harder to orgasm. This effect is sometimes used to treat premature ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Total Pleasure (Area Under the Curve):** The total pleasure extracted from a sexual act can be visualized as the area under a curve, where the x-axis is stimulation/pleasure and the y-axis is the threshold to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. A faster orgasm typically results in a shorter orgasm duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Drugs and Sexual Pleasure

Substances like alcohol and marijuana act as CNS depressants, slowing down neuronal activity and activating the parasympathetic nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. THC, specifically, activates endocannabinoid receptors (also called anandamide receptors, with "anand" meaning bliss in Sanskrit), enhancing pleasure and sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

*   By activating the parasympathetic system, these drugs increase the threshold to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This means a higher degree of stimulation is needed, but it also allows for a longer sexual act and potentially more total pleasure (a larger area under the curve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   However, excessive substance use can raise the threshold so much that orgasm becomes impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Fetishism and Foreplay

Fetishism and foreplay allow individuals to experience pleasure and move along the stimulation curve without immediately reaching the critical orgasm point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This involves stimulating erogenous zones that are not directly climax-oriented, such as earlobes or feet, or engaging in activities like BDSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

*   By increasing foreplay, individuals prolong the experience of pleasure without direct genital stimulation, keeping the pleasure level lower on the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This ultimately increases the "area under the curve," representing a greater total amount of pleasure extracted from the sexual act (akin to dopamine release) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   In contrast, masturbation is often a quick, direct genital stimulation, leading to a smaller area under the curve compared to sexual acts with extensive foreplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Gooning and Edging Explained

[[Science of gooning | Gooning]] aims to maximize sexual input by systematically **edging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Practitioners meticulously increase stimulation intensity, approaching the orgasm threshold, then deliberately pull back to avoid climaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This process of getting close to orgasm and then backing off can actually raise the orgasm threshold over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. By repeatedly doing this, gooners significantly enhance the "area under the curve," extracting a much greater amount of total pleasure before eventually allowing orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Concerns and [[potential_societal_impacts_of_gooning | Potential Societal Impacts of Gooning]]

As a relatively new practice, there are currently no scientific studies on gooning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. However, concerns arise from the general principle that hyperactivating or exploiting the body's natural systems, designed for evolutionary goals, often leads to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

*   **Analogy to Food and Gaming:** Just as highly processed foods exploit our natural drive for calorie-dense nourishment (leading to obesity and health issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, and video game designers exploit our sense of identity and achievement (leading to addiction and unfulfilled lives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, gooning may represent a new exploit of the dopaminergic and sexual pleasure circuitry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   **Reinforcing Loneliness:** Maximizing sexual pleasure independently in a "goon cave" could reduce the need for intimate connection with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. When basic needs are met independently, it can disincentivize connection with other human beings, potentially exacerbating the loneliness epidemic by removing the fundamental drive to procreate that attracts individuals to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **Interference with Relationships:** There is existing data, not specifically on gooning, but on intensive pornography use and masturbatory behavior, suggesting a potential for interference with real-life sexual relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
    *   **Supernormal Stimulus:** Pornography often presents a "supernormal stimulus" (e.g., larger body parts, more intense sensations, 4K visuals) that is far more stimulating than real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
    *   **Conditioning:** If the body becomes conditioned to such an intense form of sexual pleasure, it can become difficult to achieve orgasm or find satisfaction in real-life relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. This is observed in cases where individuals, after years of specific masturbatory habits, struggle to orgasm through vaginal intercourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. There is concern that gooning could intensify these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Caution
> While an activity may be enjoyable, it does not automatically mean it is healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. Users are advised to be mindful that new internet trends, like gooning, are constantly emerging that can activate parts of the brain and body in novel ways, but the long-term impacts are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

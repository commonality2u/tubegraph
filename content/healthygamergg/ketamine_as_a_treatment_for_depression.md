Ketamine is recognized as a novel treatment for depression, notable for its rapid onset of action compared to traditional antidepressants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:33">[04:31:33]</a>.

## How Ketamine Works

Ketamine functions as a dissociative agent, causing individuals to "separate from yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:47">[04:45:47]</a>. Its key neuroscientific action is to shut off the [[the_role_of_perception_in_depression | default mode network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:34">[05:31:34]</a>. The [[the_role_of_perception_in_depression | default mode network]] is the part of the brain responsible for self-awareness and self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. In depressed individuals, this network is often overly active, leading to excessive self-focus and negative self-talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:53">[06:51:53]</a>. By deactivating the [[the_role_of_perception_in_depression | default mode network]], ketamine helps individuals stop being "stuck in myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:37">[05:35:37]</a>.

## Speed of Efficacy

Ketamine is considered one of the quickest acting treatments for depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:55">[04:52:55]</a>. Patients experiencing a depressive episode can show improvement within hours of administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:58">[04:56:58]</a>. This contrasts sharply with most antidepressant medications like SSRIs, which typically take weeks to show effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:02">[05:02:02]</a>.

## Important Precautions

It is crucial to note that ketamine is a substance of abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:37">[04:35:37]</a>. Recreational use is not recommended due to several risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:10">[05:08:10]</a>:
*   **Purity:** There is no purity guarantee with recreational use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:13">[05:11:13]</a>.
*   **Administration:** When used therapeutically, it is administered by a licensed professional with a nurse nearby due to potential dangerous side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:15">[05:13:15]</a>.
*   **Adverse Effects:** Misuse can fracture the sense of self and potentially lead to PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:51">[07:48:51]</a>.

Therefore, ketamine should only be used under the guidance and prescription of a physician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:26">[05:24:26]</a>.

## Connection to Other Treatments

Other hallucinogenic substances, such as [[role_of_psilocybin_in_mental_health_treatment | psilocybin]] and MDMA, are also being trialed for their potential in mental health treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:44">[05:42:44]</a>. These substances are thought to have a similar effect by separating individuals from their self-focused thinking and shutting off the [[the_role_of_perception_in_depression | default mode network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:50">[05:48:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:12">[06:10:12]</a>. By fracturing the sense of self, they help individuals stop being stuck in self-reflection, leading to improvement in depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:10">[08:08:10]</a>.

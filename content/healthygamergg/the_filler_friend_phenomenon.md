Have you ever felt like a "filler friend," someone who sits in a group, rarely contributing, unnoticed when they do, and often neglected when plans are made? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> This experience can be tricky, as it often feels like you're existing *with* a group, but not truly *a part of* it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While it's easy to blame the group for not being inclusive, the challenge often lies in understanding both group dynamics and one's own role in the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This article explores the [[challenges_in_forming_human_connections_and_relationships | challenges in forming human connections and relationships]] and offers actionable strategies to overcome the "filler friend" phenomenon.

## Understanding Perceived Interest

One of the most crucial factors determining who gets invited to group activities is "perceived interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. When considering who to invite, people don't typically prioritize social status or wealth; instead, they consider who seems most interested and easiest to be around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If someone never contributes to a conversation, their perceived interest in an activity will likely be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For instance, if a group is discussing an anime convention and one person remains silent, it's assumed they aren't interested in anime, thus unlikely to be invited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### The Role of Participation

To project interest, participation is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. If you're not speaking much, you're not participating much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. One significant barrier to participation is the "what if" syndrome â€“ worries about how participation will be perceived, such as "What if they don't listen?" or "What if no one cares?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This [[understanding_the_perceived_barriers_to_relationships | paralyzing anxiety]] prevents engagement, leading to a lack of perceived interest and, consequently, fewer invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Strategies for Engagement

### The "One-Two Punch" for Benign Participation

To overcome participation hurdles, a simple technique called the "one-two punch" can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This method involves two steps:

1.  **Make a comment:** Offer a reflection or reaction to what the other person is saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
2.  **Follow with a question:** Ask an inquiry that delves into an ambiguity or a deeper aspect of the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

**Example:**
*   **Statement:** "I love anime." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   **Reaction/Comment:** "Anime is dope." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   **Question (digging into ambiguity):** "Which anime do you like?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>

This approach avoids making conversations feel like an interrogation, as simply asking questions can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Aim to use this technique about 15-20% of the time in group conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Directly Asking for Inclusion

Another transformative, yet often terrifying, tip is to directly ask if you can join plans being made in front of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

> "Hey, that sounds awesome. Is it an open invitation? Is it cool if I come?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>

This bold move addresses the "what if" anxieties directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. If they say no, you have clarity, and you're not stuck wondering or feeling like a filler friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. If they say yes, you can reinforce your interest:

*   "I don't know if y'all are like friends and stuff, like if you guys really... I'm curious. I'd love to learn more, but I don't want to be like a fifth wheel or anything like that if you guys have like a thing going. Like I wouldn't want to intrude, but I'm really interested." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>

### Reinforcing Perceived Interest and Smiling

When you do get invited and attend an event, it's crucial to reinforce your perceived interest. Start by thanking them for the invitation or for setting it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. At the end, express that you had a good time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

> "Hey, thanks for inviting me. I really had a good time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>

If you're naturally quieter, you can even add, "I'm on the quieter side, I hope that's okay." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>

Finally, a simple yet impactful non-verbal cue is to **smile** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Smiling projects openness and perceived interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

> "Oh y'all are going paintballing! I've never been paintballing before. I'm probably going to get owned, but I'd love to try it. Is it okay if I tag along?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>

## Navigating Social Interactions

### When You Don't Like Small Talk

Many people dislike small talk, finding it fake, shallow, or a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Often, this dislike stems from not knowing how to do it effectively or feeling uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. However, most human interactions begin with "upper levels of the dialogue tree" (small talk) before reaching deeper connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

While you don't have to *like* small talk, you might need to be *willing to participate* in it to form [[challenges_of_forming_genuine_human_connections | genuine connections and relationships]] and receive invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. By becoming a "conversation expert," you can learn to advance conversations quickly to topics of genuine interest, as others often prefer to skip small talk too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

### When You Don't Relate to the Conversation

If you find yourself in a conversation you don't relate to, one of the best strategies is to be curious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. People often love explaining topics they are passionate about to someone genuinely interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

> "Yo, can someone explain to me what on Earth y'all are talking about? Can you tell me what an I bond is? Can you tell me what crypto is? Can you tell me what Tether is?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>

This [[empathy_and_understanding_in_forming_relationships | approach allows you to participate]] and learn, turning a potentially boring situation into an engaging one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

By understanding the importance of perceived interest, actively participating, confronting "what if" anxieties, and being proactively engaged in social interactions, individuals can break free from the "filler friend" cycle and foster more meaningful connections.

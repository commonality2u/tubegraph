The term "incel" is explored in a discussion, noting its literal definition and broader, often negative, connotations, contrasting it with an individual's self-perception.

## The Raw Definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>
The raw definition of [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]] stands for "involuntary celibate," which is simply another way of stating that someone "can't get a girlfriend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:41">[02:18:41]</a>.

## Paul's Self-Identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:33">[02:08:33]</a>
Paul, the individual in the discussion, submitted his application using the term "incel" as an "attention-grabber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>. However, he does not fully identify with the term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>. He acknowledges that the "raw definition" applies to him, but distances himself from the additional attributes often associated with the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>.

## Broader Perceptions and Stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>
Beyond its core definition, the term [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]] is described as a "loaded term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:43">[02:24:43]</a>. According to common perceptions, to be an [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]], one must also be a "misogynist" and "part of a conspiracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>. There is a thought that [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incels]] are a "product of their own flaws," specifically that they "hate women but also... want to be with them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Paul explicitly states he is "not a misogynist" and that his preferences for individuals are not based on gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:46">[03:35:46]</a>.

## Dr. K's Stance on Labels and Individual Issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:14">[06:19:14]</a>
Dr. K emphasizes that he does not assume a "class of people has a class of issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:39">[06:31:39]</a>. He believes "there aren't executive issues there aren't gamer issues there are just people issues and each person is individual and each person is unique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. He clarifies that his specialization is not in being an [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]] or even necessarily in helping people find girlfriends, but in understanding "how your mind works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:58">[05:11:58]</a>. He notes that the discussion would not be "healing [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incels]] today because you're not an [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]]" in the broader, toxic sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:13">[04:39:13]</a>.

Dr. K expresses a willingness to speak with individuals who *do* identify as "full-blown [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]] with all of the toxicity and hatred that I know that is perceived as" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:56">[04:56:56]</a>. This highlights his view that while the label itself can be problematic, the underlying individual experiences and struggles are what truly matter.

> "The whole problem around gamer mental health is that the rest of the world treats them like they're a different person and so we say like oh you're suffering because you're a gamer it's a gamer issue and they kind of like marginalize and get keep a community my whole belief is that like there aren't executive issues there aren't gamer issues there are just people issues and each person is individual and each person is unique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:47">[06:48:47]</a>

One of the significant challenges gamers face is transitioning into the real world and engaging in activities outside of gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite having hopes, desires, and dreams, many struggle to act on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This difficulty often stems from a sense of paralysis when attempting real-world tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Roots of Paralysis: The "Smart Kid" Identity

Research indicates that the average gamer tends to be smarter, possessing higher IQs than the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. From a young age, many gamers are told they are smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This consistent message leads to the development of an identity as a "smart kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

To reinforce this identity, individuals begin to engage in activities that are perceived as smart and avoid anything that might make them appear "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This pattern often works well in early schooling, where their natural intelligence allows them to excel without extensive effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, over time, these individuals start to avoid challenging situations because struggling makes them feel "stupid," which conflicts with their core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This avoidance becomes deeply ingrained in their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### The Fear of Incompetence

The most difficult tasks for gamers often involve situations where they are observed by others and feel incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This fear of being judged or appearing "less than smart" can be profoundly paralyzing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The problem is that most new endeavors in life inherently involve initial incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. To preserve the ego of being smart, individuals avoid any activity that requires them to learn from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Ultimately, the primary roadblock to progress is the inability to tolerate the idea of failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Strategies for [[Overcoming fear of failure]]

### Reframing from "Smart/Stupid" to "Experienced/Inexperienced"

To overcome this paralysis, the first step is a fundamental shift in mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Instead of valuing intelligence above all else, recognize that the world actually values and rewards experience and competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Many smart people achieve little because they are unable to translate their intelligence into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

The key reframe is to view success not as a measure of intelligence, but as a result of experience or inexperience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> "It's not that I'm smart or I'm stupid but that I'm experienced or inexperienced."

This change in perspective is crucial for [[overcoming self sabotage]] stemming from the fear of failure. When you approach a situation, such as a job interview, by acknowledging you are "inexperienced" rather than "stupid," you naturally understand that the solution is to practice and gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

By accepting inexperience, one becomes more accepting of failure, seeing it as a normal part of the learning processâ€”much like stumbling before learning to walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This shift is the initial step toward moving forward in life and overcoming the obstacle of feeling judged or stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

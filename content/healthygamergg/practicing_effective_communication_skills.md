Often, individuals find that their thoughts, which seem eloquent and clear in their minds, become jumbled, stuttered, or forgotten when spoken aloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This can lead to frustration and a reluctance to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The core reason for this discrepancy is that [[Techniques for Effective Communication | communication]] is a skill, not an automatic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Why Thoughts Don't Always Translate to Speech

Thoughts originate from various parts of the brain, not just the area responsible for speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For instance:
*   The **default mode network** handles self-reflection and is hyperactive during depression, leading to self-deprecating thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   The **limbic system** and **frontal lobes** manage risk assessment, anxiety, and mathematical reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Empathic circuits** help us understand others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

All these diverse thoughts must be channeled through the **linguistic cortex**â€”the part of the brain responsible for choosing words and formulating how to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. When this channeling process is inefficient, communication becomes unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Just as imagining a complex physical feat like a ninja kick doesn't mean the body can perform it, thinking articulately does not automatically translate into speaking articulately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Improving this process makes one a better communicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Three Ways to Improve Communication Skills

To effectively translate thoughts into spoken words, three key areas can be addressed:

### 1. Train the Linguistic Cortex (Practice)
Improving the neural pathways that convert thoughts into words requires practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Writing things out**: This helps clarify ideas and facilitates the flow of thoughts from the mind to articulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. For example, spending years writing a book, even if it's not published, can significantly clarify one's ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Role-playing conversations**: Practicing difficult or important conversations (e.g., with parents about holidays or a boss about time off) can help refine phrasing and build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Using a "sounding board"**: Talking through ideas with another person allows for verbal practice and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Rehearsal**: Practicing speeches or specific interactions before they occur can improve delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### 2. Address Assumptions (Empathy)
When thoughts are clear in one's own mind, they often contain unspoken assumptions that are perfectly understood by the thinker but not by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Effective [[importance_of_communication_skills_in_charisma | communication]] requires engaging your empathic circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Understand the audience's perspective**: Like an author who empathizes with their reader to reveal plot twists effectively, a communicator must consider what their audience already knows and what information is missing for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Meet people where they are**: Instead of expecting others to grasp your full understanding (e.g., "Why can't you understand?"), effective communicators start by understanding their audience's current knowledge and tailor their message to bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This is analogous to how coaches work with clients, addressing underlying issues like shame before moving to stated goals like job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This is crucial for [[healthy_communication_in_relationships | healthy communication in relationships]], including [[importance_of_communication_between_parents_and_children | communication between parents and children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### 3. Calm the Mind
An agitated or overly rapid mind can hinder clear speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Slow down thought processes**: In clinical examples like mania, rapid thoughts and speech lead to nonsensical communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Conversely, calming oneself generally leads to better communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Use calming techniques**:
    *   Breathing exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
    *   In clinical settings, medications like propranolol can slow the nervous system and reduce the effects of adrenaline, helping with public speaking or [[nervousness_and_communication | nervousness and communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[improving_communication_style_for_charisma | Improving communication style for charisma]] and effectiveness is a multifaceted endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. By consistently practicing the linguistic cortex, focusing on understanding the audience's assumptions, and calming the mind, individuals can significantly enhance their ability to convey thoughts clearly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

### Other Forms of Expression
It is also possible to rationalize thoughts and heal the mind through non-verbal forms of expression such as art, music, math problems, sports, and freeform games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Practice in Casual Conversations
The principles of practice apply not only to formal speeches but also to casual conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Like most things in life, conversational skills can be honed through consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

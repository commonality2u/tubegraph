An unprecedented number of people are quitting their jobs, often in "spectacular and social media karma farming" ways, as seen with the rapid growth of the anti-work subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This phenomenon, which may extend beyond America, indicates significant underlying psychological trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Internet as a Great Equalizer
The internet has become a significant equalizer, enabling drastic societal changes by leveling the playing field between unequal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Historically, the printing press and gunpowder served similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The internet's impact stems from its ability to disseminate information, making people aware of options beyond their immediate circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Fifty years ago, an individual in a small town with a poor job would likely have limited awareness of other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While social media has its downsides, such as fostering [[the_impact_of_social_expectations_and_obligations | over-comparison]] and FOMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, it also functions as a tool that reveals better possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This increased awareness that "the world doesn't have to be as crappy as your situation is" has been detrimental to employers who previously benefited from employee ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Lack of Negative Selection Pressure
Historically, employers faced "no negative selection pressure against poor practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. They had no incentive to make employees happy, leading to practices like those that unions were formed to counterbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Corporations often thrived by preying on employee ignorance, similar to how poor restaurants existed before widespread access to food reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Change
The COVID-19 pandemic served as a "blindfold coming off" moment for many employees, revealing long-held corporate assumptions were false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>:

*   **Commuting is not necessary**: Many realized they didn't need to be in an office, eliminating hours of daily commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **End of geographical predation**: Remote work opportunities broke down geographical restrictions, allowing employees to seek jobs globally rather than being confined to local "company towns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This mirrors how companies previously outsourced jobs overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluation of priorities**: The pandemic led people to question the value of money versus time and their actual needs for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The traditional "grind" of working long hours for decades to retire was re-examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Many discovered that marginal increases in salary were not worth significant sacrifices in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Evolutionary Theory and Selection Pressure
COVID-19 introduced a "selection pressure" on jobs, forcing companies to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Previously, unchecked corporate behaviors thrived due to a lack of consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Now, workers are collectively selecting for certain types of jobs and against others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The perception of a "labor shortage" is, in reality, a "wage shortage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Labor exists, but employees are unwilling to work for undesirable conditions that companies could previously impose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This has led to "bloated profit-driven" companies facing consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

An analogy from play behavior suggests that for a game to continue, participants must win at least 30% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. If they lose more than 70%, they stop playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Companies have been "racking up w's without taking l's" for too long, and employees are no longer willing to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This current situation is a "karmic seed coming to fruition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Shifting Employee Values and Corporate Adaptation
The desire for better work conditions is evident across all levels of employment, not just the lowest wage tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. For example:

*   **Investment Banking**: Coveted jobs at firms like Goldman Sachs are now often seen as temporary stepping stones, with employees seeking to leave after a couple of years for "easier fields" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. The traditional path of working hard for decades to relax later is no longer appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Medicine**: Some individuals opt for nurse practitioner roles over becoming doctors, accepting lower pay for a better work-life balance and less demanding training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Google as an Example**: Companies like Google, which may offer slightly lower salaries, retain employees by providing a positive work environment, flexibility, and perks like cafeterias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. They recognize what employees truly want, which extends beyond just money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

Employees increasingly seek meaningful and impactful work, rather than solely focusing on large financial gains for their employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Corporate Misconceptions and Invalidation
A major psychological error by employers is their tendency to invalidate the experiences of their workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Blaming employees as "lazy" or demanding "government handouts" only exacerbates the problem, similar to how punishing a misbehaving child makes their behavior worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

Instead of addressing root issues, companies often resort to Public Relations (PR) firms to manage perception, which is a "fundamental mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. This focus on "fixing the perception of the problem" rather than the problem itself leads to a lack of transparency and an "incredibly invalidating" environment for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

This invalidation can lead to "catastrophic problems," as seen with online trolls spamming job applications for strike-breaking companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. Companies have been able to "get away with it" because they haven't been held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

### The Automation Paradox
Companies are also experiencing consequences of their past actions in other areas. For example, they automated jobs (like grocery store checkouts) to increase profits without lowering prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. Now, when workers use automation to disrupt company operations (e.g., botting job applications), companies cry foul, despite having themselves automated processes to "screw over workers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. An example is a client who was fired for writing a script to automate his job, instead of being rewarded for ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

## The Path Forward
Companies have two choices:
1.  **Continue to invalidate and blame**: This will lead to mass resignations and company closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
2.  **Adapt and listen**: Employers must ask employees "what can I do to get you to stay?" and "what would make you happy here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

While employees may always feel they could be more fairly compensated due to human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, a middle ground exists where employers don't exploit or invalidate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Recognizing that high turnover indicates problems with compensation or work environment is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

Companies must understand the financial impact of turnover and the benefit of having happy, healthy, and productive employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. The notion of employees "earning" their compensation is complex, and high compensation in leadership roles is often justified by their ability to significantly increase profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. However, expecting employees to constantly sacrifice without seeing benefit or support (e.g., working holidays without reward) is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. This "working hardest employees to extinction" is an evolutionary outcome if not selected against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

## Conclusion
The "Great Resignation" is a long-anticipated phenomenon stemming from corporate invalidation of employee experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. Employees now realize they are not geographically restricted, can work from home, and that exploitation is no longer worth it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. While many good employers exist (e.g., Costco) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, companies that fail to address problems, call employees lazy, or rely solely on PR will continue to face challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. Until companies prioritize creating a desirable work environment and listening to their employees, the current trends of disengagement and quitting will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

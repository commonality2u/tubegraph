Relationships involving [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)]] can be challenging, often characterized by intense emotional swings and feelings of being on a "roller coaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, it's crucial to understand that individuals with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] can and do get better, forming very healthy and wonderful relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. [[Strategies for maintaining a healthy relationship with someone with BPD | Success in these relationships]] often involves a commitment to therapy and self-care for both partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Prognosis and the Role of Stable Relationships
Research indicates that [[Treatment and Prognosis for BPD | BPD often resolves]] over time. Approximately 35% of individuals with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] achieve remission within one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This rate significantly increases to 91% at 10 years and 99% at 16 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. A key factor in this resolution is often the presence of a stable relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Therefore, maintaining a stable relationship, rather than abandoning it due to [[Challenges and misconceptions about dating someone with BPD | the difficulties]], can be highly beneficial for the individual with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Therapy for the Individual with BPD
One of the [[Core features of BPD and their impact on relationships | core features of BPD]] is difficulty with emotional regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Individuals with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] experience negative emotions more rapidly, intensely, and for longer durations than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. To sustain a relationship, the individual with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] must develop emotional regulation skills that do not solely rely on their partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

*   **Professional Therapy:** Encouraging professional therapy is crucial. A trained therapist can help individuals with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] manage their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** [[Treatment and Prognosis for BPD | DBT]] is considered one of the most effective evidence-based treatments for [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.
    *   It combines cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness and Eastern concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
    *   A key aspect of DBT is encouraging the "dialectic," which helps individuals with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] move beyond black-and-white thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. This means learning that two seemingly conflicting things can be simultaneously true (e.g., "Someone can be mad at you and love you at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>, or "I can be frustrated with you and love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>).
*   **Alternative Emotional Regulation Skills:** Other techniques like meditation, mindfulness, and yoga can also contribute to managing emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Important Note
> For individuals with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]], seeking help from a trained therapist is strongly recommended over coaching, as [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] is a diagnosable condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

## Self-Care and Stability for the Partner
Being in a relationship with someone with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] can be emotionally exhausting due to the "wild ride" of emotional fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's easy for the partner to become responsible for the other person's emotional equilibrium, leading to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Therefore, the partner's self-care and stability are paramount for the relationship's success.

*   **Don't Give Up:** Despite the challenges, time is often on your side, as [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] symptoms tend to remit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Remaining neutral during difficult periods can help, as emotional highs and lows will eventually normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Set Boundaries with Compassion:** It is essential to set boundaries, but do so with empathy and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
    *   Avoid reactive or accusatory language when communicating boundaries (e.g., "I don't know why you constantly text me, what do you expect? I can't text you all hours a day, I have a life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>). Such statements can trigger fear of abandonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
    *   Instead, express regret for causing hurt, acknowledge their feelings, and clearly state what you can and cannot do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Don't Overreact to the Highs:** Just as it's important not to react to the lows, avoid becoming overly invested in the intense highs of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. The idealization phase can be very addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, but over-engagement with highs can lead to an inevitable plunge into lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Strive for emotional neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.
*   **Stay Stable Yourself:** The individual with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] often mirrors their partner's emotional state due to an undeveloped sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The more stable the partner is, the more stable the person with [[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | BPD]] can become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.
    *   Seeking your own therapy is highly recommended if you are in such a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. This provides a space to manage your own emotional well-being and develop resilience.

[[Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder BPD | Individuals with BPD]] are deserving of healthy relationships and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. While their adaptations and survival mechanisms, often stemming from childhood trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, can make relationships hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>, a concerted effort towards therapy and personal stability can lead to successful outcomes.

A significant challenge faced by gamers is transitioning effectively into the real world and engaging in activities outside of gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This struggle, often manifesting as paralysis in taking action, stems from deeply ingrained patterns developed early in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. To overcome this, it's crucial to understand its origins and the underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Roots of Paralysis: Childhood and Intelligence

Data indicates that the average gamer is often smarter than the general population, possessing higher IQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. When children are frequently told they are "smart," an interesting phenomenon occurs: they begin to develop an [[identity_development_in_smart_kids | identity]] as a "smart kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

This [[identity_development_in_smart_kids | identity]] compels them to engage in activities that reinforce their perceived intelligence and, crucially, to avoid anything that might challenge or contradict this self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Consequently, if a task might make them appear "stupid" or if they are not immediately good at it, they tend to steer clear of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### The Cycle of Avoidance

Over time, this pattern leads the "smart kid" to only pursue activities that are generally easier and make them appear intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, while actively avoiding things they find difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This approach often works well in early schooling (e.g., third to fifth grade), as a smart child might not need to study extensively to excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

However, as they age, these individuals increasingly [[intelligence_leads_to_avoidance | avoid challenging situations]] because encountering difficulty makes them feel "stupid," which conflicts with their established [[identity_development_in_smart_kids | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This [[intelligence_leads_to_avoidance | avoidance]] becomes deeply ingrained in their behavior and self-perception, hindering their ability to navigate the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The most difficult things for such individuals are often those where they are observed by others and feel incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This fear of appearing less than smart, or feeling silly or incompetent, can be paralyzing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This is problematic because most new life skills require an initial period of incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Reframing for Growth

The core problem, then, is an ego built around being "smart," leading to an [[intelligence_leads_to_avoidance | avoidance]] of learning and anything that might make them feel judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. To move forward, a fundamental shift in mindset is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Shifting from "Smart/Stupid" to "Experienced/Inexperienced"

The world often values and rewards experience and competence, not just raw intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Many smart individuals may feel they haven't achieved much, often attributing this to laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, success is more closely tied to experience than intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

> "Your success has nothing to do with your intelligence it has to do with your experience or inexperience and the degree of competence you have." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

Therefore, the first step is to [[reframing_intelligence_as_experience | reframe]] self-perception: instead of thinking in terms of "smart" or "stupid," think in terms of "experienced" or "inexperienced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

```ad-note
title: Actionable Advice
If you feel paralyzed or unable to move forward, ask yourself if the roadblock is due to a fear of being judged or feeling stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. If so, change your mindset: think of yourself as *inexperienced* rather than *stupid* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
```

### Embracing Failure as a Learning Opportunity

Recognizing oneself as inexperienced naturally leads to the understanding that the solution is to *try things* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. When you accept that you are inexperienced, you become more accepting of failure, seeing it as a normal and necessary part of the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This shift allows for growth, as stumbling is an inherent part of learning to walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Developing consistency in life is often misunderstood as a problem of motivation, discipline, or willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. However, the core issue with developing consistency lies in an ignorance of one's true self, also known as "aidia" by yogis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. People often wish they could be a more consistent version of themselves from the past, but the "you" actually fluctuates daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Understanding Future Discounting

Humans are wired to value immediate gratification more than future rewards, a phenomenon called [[cognitive_biases_and_their_impact | future discounting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This means we value a dollar today more than two dollars a year from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Our brains, specifically the nucleus accumbens, are wired to prioritize things that are immediate over those that are distant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This inherent bias fundamentally leads to procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

### Impact on Consistency and Procrastination

This bias explains why individuals often "screw over tomorrow you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. For example, tasks like sorting mail, doing laundry, or filling out applications are often deferred because the current self tells itself, "I will do it later," shifting the burden to the "next guy or girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This results in the "present self" enjoying today, while the "future self" wakes up frustrated with the undone tasks left by the previous day's person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

The fundamental problem is a failure to recognize that one only gets to live for the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. When there is no conception of the future or a sense of stewardship, people tend to make things worse for the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This is observed in public spaces, like public toilets, which are often left in disarray because users don't expect to use them again and feel no sense of responsibility for the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Similarly, in one's own life, a lack of consistency is a result of leaving tasks for a future self to deal with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

This fluctuation extends beyond just desires and emotions; it affects values, choices, and the life being crafted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. For instance, someone might decide to learn a musical instrument on January 1st, but by January 3rd, they no longer want to, indicating a change in the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

## The "Temporary Custodian" Mindset

To achieve consistency, one must understand that they do not exist beyond today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Life is like a multiplayer game where different "random people" wake up in one's life daily and get to live for one day at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Instead of living as if one is permanently in charge, individuals should view themselves as temporary custodians of their life for the "person who comes next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

This concept can be understood through gaming analogies:
*   **MOBA Game Scenario:** If playing a MOBA game for someone else for only five minutes, a player would still strive to play their best game, even if they won't experience the joy of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. They would improve things for the next player taking over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Games go wrong when players, after a bad start, intentionally harm the game for the next person because they believe it's already lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **Top Chef Challenge:** In a "Top Chef" challenge, a team of five chefs must make a dish, but each chef only works for five minutes before passing it to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. Each chef acts as a custodian, trying to improve the dish for the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

By acknowledging that one is merely a custodian for today, not someone who gets to "win" at the end, the way life is lived changes, ironically leading to greater consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. The question becomes: "What kind of life do I want to set up for the person tomorrow?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>

## The Role of Self-Compassion

A critical component in addressing future discounting is self-compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. If an individual doesn't love themselves, there's no point in making sacrifices for their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Sacrifices are made for those we love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. Therefore, a lack of self-love can make it difficult to make sacrifices today for a better tomorrow, as the "future self" is not cared about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

Ultimately, achieving consistency paradoxically requires recognizing that there is no inherent consistency within oneself; one only gets to live today as a temporary custodian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. The choice then becomes whether to set things up better for the next person or to be hedonistic and create a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. The problem arises when people mistakenly believe they can "make up for it tomorrow," which is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. This understanding connects ancient principles of "aidia" (ignorance leading to suffering) with modern behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

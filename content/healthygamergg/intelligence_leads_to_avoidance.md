One significant challenge many individuals, particularly gamers, face is transitioning desired actions from thought into real-world execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite having hopes, desires, and dreams, and even knowing what they should or shouldn't be doing, many struggle to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This "paralysis" often stems from how individuals are treated when they are very young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Problem: Paralysis in Action

A common issue, especially among gamers, is the difficulty in engaging with activities outside of their virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This inability to pursue real-world goals, despite knowing what needs to be done, is a "perfectly reasonable problem to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Understanding the root cause is crucial for gaining control over one's behavior and initiating desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## The Root Cause: Early Intelligence Identity

Data indicates that the average gamer tends to be more intelligent, often possessing higher IQs, than the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This high intelligence, combined with early environmental feedback, frequently leads to a specific psychological development:

### Formation of a "Smart Kid" Identity
Many intelligent children are consistently told they are smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This creates an [[impact_of_early_intelligence_identity | identity]] as a "smart kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Once this identity is established, children naturally gravitate towards actions that reinforce it and avoid anything that might contradict it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

For example, a child with this identity will choose tasks that make them appear intelligent and avoid anything they are not good at or that might make them "look stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Over time, this results in them only pursuing activities that are generally easier, ensuring they maintain their smart image, and staying away from things that are difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This strategy works well in early schooling (e.g., up to third, fourth, or fifth grade) because a smart child might not need to study extensively to excel and receive praise from parents and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Avoidance of Challenging Experiences
As these children mature, they continue to avoid challenging tasks because attempting them might lead to feeling "stupid," which conflicts with their core [[impact_of_early_intelligence_identity | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This avoidance becomes deeply ingrained and a fundamental part of their interaction with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

<div class="callout warning">
The hardest activities for such individuals, particularly gamers, involve situations where they are observed by others and feel incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Even when facing strangers they will never see again, the discomfort of appearing incompetent is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
</div>

This leads to a pervasive avoidance of any experience that makes them feel less than smart, silly, or incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This [[challenges_faced_by_smart_individuals | paralyzing effect]] is problematic because most new endeavors in life require initial incompetence and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The desire to preserve the ego of being smart prevents individuals from engaging in necessary learning processes, leading to a state where they know what they should do but are unable to act due to fear of judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## The Solution: Reframing Intelligence as Experience

To overcome this paralysis, a fundamental shift in mindset is required:

### From Smart/Stupid to Experienced/Inexperienced
Society often places a high value on inherent intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, the world truly values and rewards **experience** and **competence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Many highly intelligent individuals achieve little because intelligence alone is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The feeling of being smart but unable to accomplish much is a common sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The key is to [[reframing_intelligence_as_experience | reframe]] self-perception from a "smart or stupid" dichotomy to an "experienced or inexperienced" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Recognizing that success is tied to one's experience and competence, rather than raw intelligence, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

<div class="callout quote">
"It's not that I'm smart or I'm stupid but that I'm experienced or inexperienced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
</div>

### Embracing Inexperience and Failure
When individuals view themselves as inexperienced rather than stupid, the natural solution becomes clear: **try things** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This mindset shift makes the prospect of failure acceptable, even normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The inability to tolerate the idea of failing is a significant roadblock for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. By reframing, failure becomes an expected part of the learning processâ€”much like stumbling is a normal part of learning to walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

This change in mindset is the first step toward overcoming the obstacles of feeling stupid or judged, enabling forward movement in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Gooning, a relatively new phenomenon, involves "min-maxing" the act of masturbation to achieve maximal pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It's described as taking masturbation and adding a certain amount of edging to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This practice, growing in the "nether regions of the internet," seeks to understand and leverage the [[neuroscience_and_applied_neuroscience | neuroscience]] and physiology of sexual pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Historical Medical Perspectives on Masturbation

Historically, views on masturbation have varied greatly:

*   **17th Century:** Some believed masturbation could strengthen the penis in young boys, making them better able to procreate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **19th Century:** Attitudes shifted significantly. A prominent figure, Swiss doctor Tissot, published texts, such as one in 1839, detailing the supposed dangers of masturbation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Physical Symptoms:** Tissot described "venereal excess" leading to loss of flesh and strength, paleness, yellowish skin, blue circles around the eyes, puffy eyelids (edema), soft and flaccid flesh, and profuse perspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. He also noted general asthenia (muscular weakness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This description, according to the speaker, essentially depicts a "sweaty nerd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   **Mental and Emotional Symptoms:** The "onanist" (a term for masturbator) was said to suffer from taciturnity, avoiding eye contact, loving solitude, and feeling embarrassed or ashamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. They constantly experienced sadness, ennui, restlessness, and fatigue, compounded by feelings of shame, regret, and remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Tissot's descriptions resemble the "symptomatology of being an Internet troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. It's important to note that these historical medical texts primarily focused on boys and men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## [[Neuroscience of sexual pleasure and orgasm | The Neuroscience and Physiology of Sexual Pleasure]]

Understanding gooning requires an understanding of the basic mechanisms of sexual pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Autonomic Nervous System Involvement

The sexual system uniquely combines the **parasympathetic nervous system** (rest and digest) and the **sympathetic nervous system** (fight or flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

*   **Parasympathetic Activation:** Responsible for erection in males and clitoral vasodilation/engorgement in females, facilitating blood flow to the genitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Sympathetic Activation:** As stimulation increases towards orgasm, the sympathetic nervous system activates, causing one-way valves to close, trapping blood and maintaining erection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### The "Calculus of Orgasm"

Sexual pleasure can be conceptualized by plotting stimulation/pleasure on the x-axis and threshold to orgasm on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Orgasm occurs when the level of stimulation crosses the individual's threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

Factors influencing the orgasm threshold:

*   **Abstinence:** Not having sex for a while decreases the threshold, making it easier and faster to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **SSRIs:** Medications like SSRIs interfere with the ability to orgasm, raising the threshold. This can be used clinically for conditions like premature ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **CNS Depressants (e.g., alcohol, marijuana):** These drugs slow neuronal activity in the brain and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, thereby increasing the orgasm threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. While they can prolong the sexual act and increase the "area under the curve" (total pleasure experienced), excessive use can raise the threshold so much that orgasm becomes impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Foreplay and Fetishism

Activities like foreplay or engaging in certain fetishes (e.g., BDSM) allow for prolonged stimulation without immediately reaching the critical orgasm point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This is because they may not involve direct genital stimulation initially, or they might introduce stimuli like pain that can raise the orgasm threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. By prolonging the experience, these activities significantly increase the "area under the curve," representing the total amount of pleasure (and dopamine release) extracted from the sexual act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Masturbation, in contrast, is often a quick process with a smaller area under the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Gooning: The Art of Edging

Gooning is essentially an advanced form of edging, aiming to "min-max" sexual inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Practitioners often create "goon caves" with multiple monitors and ritualistic elements like incense to enhance stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The core practice involves increasing stimulation intensity without reaching orgasm, slowing down when close to the threshold, and then resuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This process of repeatedly nearing orgasm and backing off appears to raise the orgasm threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. By extending the duration of high-intensity stimulation, gooning significantly enhances the "area under the curve," extracting a maximal amount of pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Concerns and Predictions About Gooning

While gooning is a new phenomenon with no current studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, the speaker raises concerns by drawing parallels to other forms of biological system exploitation:

*   **Exploitation of Biological Systems:** The human body and brain are designed for evolutionary goals. When systems are hyperactivated or exploited (e.g., through highly processed foods that exploit our preference for high fat/sugar, leading to obesity and health issues), it generally does not end well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   **Disincentivizing Social Connection:** Gooning, by maximizing individual sexual pleasure, could reduce the need for interpersonal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This is likened to coping mechanisms that effectively remove the need to fulfill needs in a more natural, social way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. The concern is that if the fundamental drive to procreate, which attracts humans to each other, is removed through self-gratification, it could worsen the loneliness epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Interference with Real-Life Sexual Relationships:** Similar to the effects of intensive pornography use, gooning may condition the body to a "supernormal stimulus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This can make it difficult for individuals to achieve orgasm through typical sexual intercourse because their bodies are conditioned to a specific, often more intense, type of stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

The speaker advises caution, emphasizing that while such practices might be enjoyable and activate parts of the brain and body, they are not necessarily healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

The discussion centers on the concept of self-value, particularly how it manifests in professional and personal contexts, often through [[struggles_with_selfworth_and_selfesteem | struggles with self-worth and self-esteem]]. The conversation explores themes of [[focusing_on_personal_well_being_rather_than_external_validation | external validation]] versus intrinsic worth, the impact of [[impact_of_parental_expectations_on_selfworth | parental expectations on self-worth]], and the behavioral patterns that emerge when one's [[understanding_self_and_identity_to_improve_consistency | understanding of self and identity]] is disconnected from their perceived value.

## Manifestations of Low Self-Worth
Low self-worth can present in various ways, including:

*   **Self-Sabotage**
    *   Felix describes intentionally performing poorly in games or taking actions to lose viewers on his stream if he feels he is playing badly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This behavior is driven by a desire to lose a "rank" or viewership, so he can then work to "get it back" and feel he "deserves it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He would purposely "destroy a part of something just so I could feel like I deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   This constant need to prove worth is described as "tiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   When his audience remains despite poor performance, Felix feels "upset" and that he is "wasting their time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. He actively tries to "shave off viewers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
    *   This is a form of self-sabotage where Felix pushes away external validation because it contradicts his internal belief that he does not deserve it unless earned through struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.
*   **Imposter Syndrome**
    *   Felix mentions feeling "impostor syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, which is tied to the feeling of not deserving his own stage or success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
    *   He feels "discomforting" when people stay and watch him play poorly, because he thinks his value is determined by his gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. He cannot "fathom that someone would stay on the stage if you're playing bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
    *   This indicates a disconnect between his self-perception and how others value him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value
The discussion highlights two types of value:
*   **Intrinsic Value:** Value derived from one's inherent being and who they are as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Extrinsic Value:** Value shown by the external world, often based on performance or achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

Felix's sense of value appears to be heavily dependent on his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. He believes his worth is tied to his gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>, even though his Twitch audience often stays because they "like you, they value you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, not just for his skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. He finds it "confusing" that he has value outside of his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

## Parental Influence on Self-Worth
A significant factor in Felix's self-value issues appears to be his relationship with his father and the [[impact_of_parental_expectations_on_selfworth | impact of parental expectations on self-worth]].

*   **Conditional Love and Pride:** Felix's father "always wanted him to compete and look better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a> in various activities like skiing and biking, even if Felix didn't enjoy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. His father would be "super proud" when he won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.
    *   Felix felt he "went for myself and I went for him too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.
    *   When Felix did poorly in trampoline, his father's support was like "people not leaving the audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>, which Felix felt "doubles the pressure" to win the next time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
    *   Felix perceives his father's pride as complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, implying it might be contingent or conditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. He believes his father isn't proud because he didn't "perform in like like schooling" or sports his father wanted him to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>. His success in other areas, like streaming, doesn't fit his father's "model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.
*   **Unconditional Love:** In contrast, Felix's mother is described as "always there for me in whatever I want" and her reactions, whether he succeeded or failed, were "not intense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. When asked if his mom is proud of him, he gives a simple "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. This suggests his mother's love is unconditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>, unlike his father's.
*   **Impact of Parental Devaluation:** A specific moment where Felix's father devalued his accomplishment (212 Twitch subscribers) by asking "when does that make you go back to school?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a> was "crushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. This incident moved his "value as a human being" down, creating a need for external validation to fill that gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. This established a pattern where his "value as a human being depends on performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

## Rebuilding Self-Worth and Battling Negative Self-Beliefs
Overcoming these challenges involves:

*   **Challenging Core Beliefs:** Recognizing that one's value is not solely dependent on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Addressing the Root Cause:** Exploring the reasons behind the feeling of not having intrinsic value. For Felix, this involves understanding his relationship with his father and the conditional nature of his perceived pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. This can involve having conversations with parents to distinguish between fair and unfair expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.
*   **Embracing Unconditional Self-Acceptance:** Understanding that success comes from devotion to one's craft and continuously trying to improve, not from external validation or perceptions of being a "good person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **Connecting with Emotions:** Felix exhibits [[psychological_concepts_and_selfunderstanding | alexithymia]], a difficulty in recognizing and expressing emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>. Learning to identify and vocalize feelings like hurt and anger, rather than channeling them into "cold anger" or analytical thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:20">[01:37:20]</a>, is crucial for healing and healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.
*   **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Felix struggles with meditating because his mind is "always there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a> with "chess moves" or other "visuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a>. The suggested approach to meditation for Felix is not about stillness, but about active engagement and exhaustion of the mind by rapidly shifting attention between different sensory inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:59">[01:47:59]</a>. This method aims to achieve a "stillness that comes through maximal effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:08">[02:02:08]</a>, allowing the mind to naturally settle after being pushed to its limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:07">[02:03:07]</a>.

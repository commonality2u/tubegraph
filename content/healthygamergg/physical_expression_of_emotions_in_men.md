Therapy, particularly talk therapy, has historically been structured around methods that may not align with how men typically express emotions, leading to systemic biases that make it challenging for men to engage effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This approach stems from the fact that the majority of psychotherapy patients and therapists have historically been, and continue to be, women (60-70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This has led to a model where success is often measured by the ability to articulate feelings, which is more common among women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Systemic Biases in Emotional Expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

The American Psychological Association has pointed out a systemic bias in how men and women are diagnosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Diagnoses often given to women, such as depression and anxiety, are typically linked to feelings and the ability to articulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. In contrast, men are more often diagnosed with "externalizing disorders" like addictions, sociopathy, or antisocial personality disorder, which are characterized by behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This suggests that when men experience emotions, they tend to act on them rather than articulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Emotions as Problems to be Solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>

For men, an emotion is often viewed as a problem to be solved rather than something to be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. From a young age, boys are taught that articulating problems and crying can lead to punishment or being treated worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Instead, the expectation is to "fix the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. For example, if a man feels ashamed due to unemployment, the societal expectation is to "get a job and start making money," not to verbally express the shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The solution to an internal feeling is to take an action and change the external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Reluctance in Couples Counseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>

Men often show reluctance to engage in couples counseling because they "feel outgunned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. They perceive their partners as being much better at understanding and articulating feelings, enabling them to make their case more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Men may struggle to respond to questions about their feelings, often resorting to "I don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This is because they "don't speak the language of emotions" that therapists and partners may use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Different Communication Styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

Men communicate emotions differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. A common example is the "negative expression of a positive affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. When a man feels proud or happy for a friend, instead of verbalizing it, they might "dog" them, call them "whipped," or use other outwardly negative but affectionately intended remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This indirect communication style is not compatible with how psychotherapy is typically conducted, where therapists are trained to listen and ask open-ended questions about feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This can leave men feeling like "an idiot" in therapy because they cannot articulate what they feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## The Physicality of Male Emotional Experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>

Men often describe their emotional experiences in physical terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. For example, instead of saying "I feel unlovable" after a breakup, a man might say, "It felt like she ripped my heart out; it felt like she stomped on my balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Other men typically understand these physical metaphors immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Mind-Body Connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

There is a significant [[role_of_hormonal_and_emotional_awareness_in_mens_anxiety | physiological aspect]] to emotional health that is often overlooked in traditional talk therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Modern science confirms that emotions have physical ramifications; for instance, anxiety can affect digestion or activate the sympathetic nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This understanding highlights that emotions are deeply physiological in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. For men, this physical component can be more critical for emotional healing than verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Physical gestures, like hugs, can lead to significant emotional breakthroughs for men in therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Recommendations for Men Seeking Emotional Health

Despite these challenges, psychotherapy remains an evidence-based and effective approach for mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

1.  **Seek Multiple Therapists**: Try at least three different psychotherapists to find a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. A lot of psychotherapy success depends on the connection and communication style between the patient and therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
2.  **Be Transparent About Emotional Awareness**: Inform your therapist early on that you may not be fully aware of your feelings or good at articulating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Research the concept of normative male alexithymia—the idea that most men are "colorblind" to their internal emotional states—and discuss this with your therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
3.  **Request a Change in Style**: If a therapist's quiet, open-ended questioning style isn't working, ask them to be more active or offer more guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
4.  **Consider a Referral**: If therapy isn't helping after two or three sessions, communicate this to your therapist and ask for a recommendation for a different therapist who might be a better fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. A good therapist prioritizes the patient's well-being and will help them find the right support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Incorporate Bodily and Somatic Practices

Given that many emotions reside in the body, men may benefit significantly from approaches that incorporate physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Physical Activity**: Practices like Tai Chi and yoga are effective for mood disorders and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Adding a physical component to emotional health is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   **[[alternative_and_somatic_therapies_for_men | Somatic Therapies]]**: Explore therapies that integrate the body, such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique/Tapping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. These methods, though once viewed with skepticism, are gaining evidence for their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Men's Groups**: Look into men's groups that involve physical activities, rituals, or hikes, as these can provide a communal and physical outlet for emotional expression and bonding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

Understanding these [[impact_of_cultural_and_social_norms_on_male_anxiety | differences in emotional expression]] can help men navigate the path to emotional health, recognizing that their journey may require different approaches than those traditionally emphasized in talk therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. It's about leveraging the body and physical approaches to achieve emotional well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

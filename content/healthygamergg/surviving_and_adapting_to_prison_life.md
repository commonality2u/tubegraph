Anthony, at 41, spent 20 years in adult prison, having been charged with second-degree murder at the age of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. He received the maximum possible sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

## Initial Fears and Survival Mode

Upon entering prison, Anthony was terrified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. He understood that unlike school bullying, prison offered no escape or home to retreat to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. He knew that if he were victimized once, it would never stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This realization, coupled with the feeling that a 20-year sentence was "20 lifetimes," led him to abandon all "give a shits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. His primary goal was not to be a victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

### Behavioral Adaptations

To avoid victimization, Anthony's approach was to "go crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. If someone spoke disrespectfully, it would immediately escalate to a fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. This led to him stabbing people and receiving increased prison sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This behavior was an [[role_of_adaptation_and_survival_in_mental_health | adaptation]] to the prison environment where "flight" was not an option, forcing him to "fight" when an adrenaline response occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. His "resting face" also served as an [[role_of_adaptation_and_survival_in_mental_health | adaptive]] trait in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

## Psychological Impact

Despite the harsh realities, Anthony stated he never experienced depression during his 20 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Prison life, in his view, was primarily boring and offered no positive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### Numbing to Life's Prospects

To survive such a long and challenging sentence, Anthony had to actively [[coping_with_feelings_of_hopelessness_and_redefining_life_goals | numb himself to the prospect of life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. This meant [[coping_with_feelings_of_hopelessness_and_redefining_life_goals | killing any joy or goals]] and [[coping_with_feelings_of_hopelessness_and_redefining_life_goals | giving up on life entirely]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>. Hope, which would naturally "sprout up in your garden like a weed," had to be plucked out daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

### Rigidity and Routine

Prison enforced a rigid schedule for eating and daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:44">[01:56:44]</a>. Anthony found comfort and a sense of routine in this structure, which helped him get through each day, moving from one meal to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:50">[01:56:50]</a>. This comfort in routine contributed to a [[survival_mechanism_and_rigidity_in_beliefs | rigidity]] in his thinking and behavior that extended beyond prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:27">[01:56:27]</a>.

## Post-Incarceration Reflections

Anthony feels "zero regrets" about going to prison, believing he deserved every bit of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. He acknowledges that his [[life_experiences_of_an_exconvict | ex-convict]] status has presented significant challenges, such as difficulty renting and securing most jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

A therapist notes that much of what holds people back after trauma are [[role_of_adaptation_and_survival_in_mental_health | adaptations]] learned for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:02">[02:07:02]</a>. For Anthony, this included his acquired [[survival_mechanism_and_rigidity_in_beliefs | rigidity]] in thinking and his tendency to appear terrifying, which was an [[role_of_adaptation_and_survival_in_mental_health | adaptation]] from his traumatic upbringing and prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. To move forward, he must unlearn these survival strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, Anthony is described as a [[psychological_resilience_and_growth_from_hardship | survivor]] with a unique perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:44">[02:01:44]</a>. He is seen as "dormant," just beginning to wake up, and capable of significant accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:41">[02:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:51">[02:04:51]</a>. His path forward involves living life, experiencing challenges, and letting go of the need to numb himself to life's possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

> "The only way you survive that is by giving up on life entirely and saying like I have to exactly what I did yes any kind of joy goal not just dead you had to kill it bro right when a tiny bit of hope on your 21st birthday you don't dare hope hope hope keeps wanting to sprout up in your garden like a weed and there you are every day plucking it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>

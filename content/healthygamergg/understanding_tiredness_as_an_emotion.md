Tiredness is often misunderstood as solely a physiological state, such as a lack of sleep or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, it is fundamentally an emotion that serves an adaptive purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Is Tiredness an Emotion?

Community tracking reveals that "tired" is the most common emotion people report feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This perspective challenges the common assumption that tiredness is merely a physical condition, leading to questions like whether one can feel [[mental_and_physiological_dimensions_of_tiredness | mentally tired]] or if it's purely a physical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Often, people who are not depressed or burnt out, and who engage in self-care like exercise, may still wake up feeling a lack of zest or excitement, questioning if this is a form of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Emotions, including tiredness, are not inherently good or bad; they are information provided by the brain and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Just as fear or anxiety signal worry, tiredness provides a specific message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Humans share the universal experience of feeling tired, suggesting that it serves a particular function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Understanding this function is key to [[strategies_to_overcome_feelings_of_tiredness | overcoming tiredness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

When people exclusively view tiredness as a [[physiological_causes_of_tiredness_and_energy_management | physiological state]], they often resort to physical remedies like supplements or dietary changes, despite continuing to feel tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## The Evolutionary Purpose of Tiredness

[[the_evolutionary_purpose_of_tiredness | Tiredness is an adaptive mechanism]] developed by the brain to help avoid perceived "useless work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It is the brain's response to the perception of a high workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Historically, the brain evolved in an environment where tasks requiring immense effort often had a low probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. To prevent wasting precious energy on endeavors with slim chances of success, the brain induces tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Tiredness essentially sends a message: "Don't do it. Don't bother. Don't try. Stop. I'm not going to give you the energy for such a rare, difficult thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This mechanism discourages investing energy in long-term, questionable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Tiredness in Modern Society

This ancient brain mechanism now confronts modern societal tasks like paying taxes or writing a dissertation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The brain struggles to compute the effort required for these tasks in a way that aligns with successful completion. For instance, paying taxes or writing a dissertation might feel like an overwhelming, endless task with unclear progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. When the brain estimates a very high workload with uncertain chances of success or visible progress, it protects the individual from wasting energy, leading to feelings of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Tiredness can manifest suddenly due to emotional or psychological triggers, even when physiologically rested. Examples include:
*   Feeling exhausted at the mere sight of a phone call from a parent one doesn't wish to speak with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The immediate fatigue experienced when seeing someone on the street soliciting donations, anticipating an uncomfortable interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Feeling tired after seeing an email from a boss late on a Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

These scenarios illustrate that tiredness is not solely a function of physical exertion or lack of sleep but can be a direct response to perceived emotional or mental workload and anticipated negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Tiredness as an Energy Conservation Strategy

Tiredness acts as an [[physiological_causes_of_tiredness_and_energy_management | energy conservation strategy]], shaping behavior by using emotion to prevent what the brain perceives as mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It's the brain's way of saying, "Don't even bother" with tasks that seem overwhelmingly difficult to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. For example, ignoring a difficult phone call might initially provide relief, but the underlying emotional exhaustion can persist even without physical interaction, as the brain continues to interpret the situation as a drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Overcoming Tiredness by Understanding its Signal

To [[strategies_to_overcome_feelings_of_tiredness | overcome tiredness]], the first step is to recognize the specific scenario in which it arises and understand what your body is signaling you not to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Key questions to ask yourself when feeling tired:
1.  **"What about this situation is exhausting?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> Often, it's not the physical energy expenditure but the perceived emotional or mental cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
2.  **"Why is my body telling me not to do it?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a> This helps identify the underlying emotional or psychological barrier.
3.  **"If I were to do this task, how would I truly feel afterward?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>
    *   Sometimes, despite initial tiredness, completing the task might lead to a sense of accomplishment and feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
    *   Other times, the mind might logically conclude that even partial progress won't alleviate the overwhelming feeling due to the sheer amount left to do, leading to a "don't even start" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
    *   For relationship issues, like dreading family visits, tiredness can signal a deeper issue, such as feeling relied upon for emotional needs that cannot be fulfilled, leading to emotional draining without resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

By critically examining these internal calculations, one can discover if their brain is disincentivizing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. When the brain re-evaluates the "waste of energy" perception, it can reduce the feeling of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

This understanding explains why productivity techniques like chunking large tasks into smaller, achievable pieces are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Breaking down a daunting task (e.g., 100 chapters) into smaller, manageable goals (e.g., reading 1 chapter today) allows the brain to perceive a successful completion of the immediate target, thus no longer seeing it as a waste of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

Many people experience a disconnect between their clear thoughts and their spoken words, often leading to stumbling, stuttering, or forgetting what they intended to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This phenomenon, where eloquent internal rehearsals turn into garbled external communication, is a common source of frustration, sometimes leading to a reluctance to speak at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This can be exacerbated by [[nervousness_and_communication | anxiety]] and fear of judgment, sometimes alongside conditions like ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The fundamental issue is that while thoughts in our mind may seem pure, clean, and perfectly sensible, something gets "super garbled" when they are translated into spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. People often wonder why this happens, given how clear things are in their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Why Thoughts Don't Always Translate Coherently

Our thoughts are not solely confined to the "linguistic cortex," the part of our brain responsible for choosing words and formulating speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Thoughts originate from various parts of the brain, including:
*   **Default Mode Network**: Responsible for self-reflection, often hyperactive during depression and self-deprecating thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Limbic System & Frontal Lobes**: Manage functions like risk assessment, [[managing_anxiety_and_emotional_needs_in_relationships | anxiety]], and mathematical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Empathic Circuits**: Help us understand others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

When we speak, all these diverse thoughts must be channeled through the linguistic cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Improving this channeling process leads to better communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Communication as a Skill

The short answer to why thoughts don't translate directly into coherent speech is that communication is a skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Just as one can imagine performing complex physical feats like martial arts or parkour without being able to execute them, articulate thinking doesn't automatically translate into articulate speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. It requires practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective Communication

To improve communication and ensure thoughts translate well, focus on three key areas:

### 1. Training the Linguistic Cortex
This involves working on the neural pathways that convert thoughts into words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Writing Things Out**: Clarifying ideas through writing can facilitate the process of getting thoughts from your head, through the linguistic cortex, and out verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This practice can help organize ideas, even if the written product itself is not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Role-Playing and Rehearsal**: Practicing conversations, whether for significant discussions (e.g., talking to parents about holidays, speaking with a boss) or casual interactions, helps refine phrasing and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Having a "sounding board" can be particularly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### 2. Addressing Assumptions and Engaging Empathy
When we think, we operate with a set of assumptions that are perfectly clear to us because they are our own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, when communicating, these unspoken assumptions can create gaps in understanding for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

To bridge this gap:
*   **Empathize with the Audience**: Use the empathic circuits of your brain to put yourself in the other person's shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Identify Missing Information**: Consider what the audience already understands and what additional information or context is needed to convey your message effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Meet Them Where They Are**: Instead of expecting others to grasp your perspective automatically ("Why can't you understand?"), adjust your communication to start from their current understanding and guide them step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This approach is fundamental in fields like coaching, where practitioners meet clients at their current state, even if it differs from the client's stated fantasy goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### 3. Calming the Mind
The speed and clarity of thought directly impact speech coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. For example, in mania, rapid thoughts and speech often lead to nonsensical communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

*   **Slow Things Down**: Reducing mental and physical speed can significantly improve communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Breathing Exercises**: These can help calm the nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   **Medication**: In some clinical scenarios, medications like propranolol (an adrenergic blocker) can be prescribed to reduce the effects of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenaline, effectively slowing down the mind and improving public speaking ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This demonstrates a direct link between physiological calmness and communication effectiveness.

## Conclusion
To effectively communicate, ensuring thoughts translate clearly, focus on these three strategies:
*   **Practice with your linguistic cortex** through writing and rehearsal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **Focus on assumptions** and adapt your communication by considering the other person's point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Calm down your mind** and slow your thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

Effective communication is a multifactorial challenge, involving various brain functions and even bodily states (e.g., adrenaline levels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Addressing it often requires a multi-faceted approach. Furthermore, beyond verbal communication, individuals can rationalize and process thoughts through various expressive arts like music, mathematics, and sports, which can also contribute to mental healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

## Navigating Parental Approval of a Partner
When facing [[dealing_with_parental_disapproval | parental disapproval]] of a partner, confidence in your choice can significantly influence your parents' acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Miss Cruy introduced her partner, Olo, to her parents when his future was uncertain, but her unwavering belief in him helped ease their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Her parents took to him instantly because she was confident and serious about him, and he wasn't trying to prove anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

Dr. K's father also initially expressed hesitation about his relationship with Cruy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. However, when Dr. K affirmed his certainty about Cruy, his father became supportive, demonstrating that a child's conviction can sway parental opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

### Communication Strategies
When discussing concerns about a partner with parents, consider the following [[parentchild_communication | communication]] strategies:
*   **Confidence in your partner**: Possess faith in your partner, which can help your parents feel more at ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Direct conversation**: For sensitive topics, a conversation in a car can be beneficial as it avoids direct eye contact and provides a captive audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. This format can also be useful for discussing marital problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on values**: Talk to your parents about their values and strive to help them understand and respect your own value system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. If parental disapproval stems from superficial attributes like race, ethnicity, profession, or religion, emphasize that your partner is not defined by these things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. Explain how your partner shares core values, even if external labels differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **Listen to valid concerns**: While cultural biases can be dismissed, it's crucial to genuinely listen if parents express concerns about the partner's character, actions, or how they treat you. Parents, having more life experience, may observe issues you're overlooking due to your own strong feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>. For example, if a partner is not professionally settled and the parents have struggled financially, their concerns may be valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

## Cultural and Societal Expectations
Parental expectations, particularly in Indian immigrant families, often follow a "pecking order" for acceptable partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>:

*   **Profession**: High-value professions include doctoral degrees, banking, finance, medicine, law, engineering, and computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Successful family-run businesses are also highly regarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. Careers in arts, for instance, are often seen as "not a real thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
*   **Ethnicity**: Indian parents often prefer partners from their specific state, caste, or language group, followed by Indian people from other states. Outside of Indian descent, Caucasian and Asian individuals are often more acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.
*   **Religion**: A strong preference exists for partners of the same religion. Among other religions, Judaism is sometimes surprisingly acceptable to Hindu Indian parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

Despite these traditional expectations, it is possible for individuals to work with their parents to [[strategies_for_building_trust_and_understanding_between_parents_and_children | bring them closer]] to what is important to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. Parents may gradually realize that valuing freedom and personal choices for their children is more important than strict adherence to cultural norms they might have maintained if they hadn't immigrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

## Living with Parents as an Adult
When adult children become the primary provider for their parents, the dynamic shifts. It's essential for parents to begin respecting their children as equals or colleagues rather than dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

Key considerations for managing this transition:
*   **Acknowledge shifting responsibilities**: Understand that the "dharma" or duty shifts from parents taking care of you to you taking care of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Open communication**: Talk openly about expectations, changes in communication, and how financial resources will be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Set mutual limits**: Establish mutually acceptable limits on spending or household responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Treat parents as adults and colleagues**: Foster an environment of mutual respect, even though the transition might be bumpy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Manage minor conflicts**: Be prepared for disagreements over small household issues (e.g., where items are stored) as these can become sources of frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

## Key Takeaways on Parental Support
*   **Children's confidence matters**: A child's strong conviction in their partner can often lead to greater parental acceptance, even amidst initial hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural adaptation**: Parents may adapt their expectations over time, especially immigrant parents who prioritize their children's happiness and freedom in a new culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
*   **Listen critically**: Discern between culturally ingrained biases and genuine concerns about a partner's character or treatment of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.
*   **Role reversal**: As children become providers, establishing boundaries and clear communication around financial and household management is crucial for maintaining respectful [[parentchild_communication | parent-child dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

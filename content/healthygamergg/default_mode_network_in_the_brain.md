The default mode network (DMN) is a specific part of the brain that enables humans to have self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This capacity for self-awareness is considered a primary difference between humans and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Function of the Default Mode Network
The DMN allows for self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, enabling individuals to observe their actions and reflect on their sense of self within those actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, a deer searching for food does not feel unintelligent if it fails, but a human might feel like an "idiot" after social rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This represents the DMN's role in meta-level thinking about oneself while interacting with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## DMN and Depression
While self-awareness is a profound capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, its existence also introduces the possibility of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Research shows that people experiencing depression tend to have overly active default mode networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

An overactive DMN can cause individuals to attribute fault to themselves even in minor situations that are not their responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This hyperactive self-reflection can lead to thoughts such as "my family would be better off without me" or "these people are going to fire me because I'm a waste of space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The mind becomes constantly occupied by thoughts about oneself, making "you" the object of your own attention, akin to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This persistent self-focus is correlated [[neuroscience_and_applied_neuroscience | neuroscientifically]] with depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Treatments Affecting the DMN
Novel treatments for depression, such as ketamine, are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Ketamine is a dissociative agent that causes separation from oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. It is one of the fastest-acting treatments for depression, with improvements seen within hours, compared to weeks for typical antidepressant medications like SSRIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. From a [[neuroscience_and_applied_neuroscience | neuroscience]] perspective, ketamine works by shutting off the default mode network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Similarly, hallucinogenic substances like psilocybin and MDMA, currently undergoing trials, also affect the DMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These substances can induce a "cosmic sense of connection" by separating individuals from their self-focused thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. They allow the mind to pull back from constant self-reflection and shut off the DMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Important Considerations:
It is crucial to note that recreational use of these substances is not recommended due to purity and administration concerns, as well as dangerous side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. When used for treatment, administration is under the guidance of a physician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Substances like psilocybin can also "fracture our sense of self," which can be traumatic and potentially lead to PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. However, when this fracturing occurs and the individual is no longer stuck thinking about themselves, the problem of over-self-awareness can resolve, leading to improvement in depressive symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

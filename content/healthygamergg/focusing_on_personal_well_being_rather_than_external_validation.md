A key paradox in personal growth is that when individuals let go of the desire for external validation and instead focus on [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | themselves]], they become more attractive to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means allowing oneself to be authentically human, rather than trying to fit an ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Overwhelmed Individual: A Case Study

Many individuals, feeling they will be alone forever, perceive themselves as objectively unattractive or without hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. One such individual, aged 26, expressed feeling "conventionally ugly" and "deformed" with a lazy eye and a crooked nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, and was also overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Despite knowing there are things they could do to improve their chances, such as losing weight, they lacked motivation, believing it wouldn't make a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

This person felt broken from years of rejection and romantically stunted, fearing that even if they miraculously changed their appearance, they would still be too far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. They described their situation as objectively "screwed," a premise that can be acknowledged as valid without agreeing with the conclusion of hopelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Understanding the "Incel Mindset"

It's important not to dismiss such feelings as delusional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. If someone genuinely feels they are objectively disadvantaged, their logical analysis might be correct regarding their current predicament, even if their conclusion about future hopelessness is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Insisting "your feelings are valid" can sometimes invalidate the person's lived experience, implying their situation is "just in their head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Instead, acknowledging the objective difficulties (e.g., physical attributes, lack of experience) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## The Problem of Overwhelm and Lack of Motivation

Individuals often lack motivation not because there are no solutions, but because there are too many, leading to overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The brain, being efficient at calculating what is "worth doing," disengages when a goal feels too vast or unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

For example, considering surgery for a lazy eye, going to the gym, or attending therapy all seem insufficient if the ultimate goal is to "get with someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Each individual step feels inadequate to solve the overarching problem, leading to a paralysis akin to chronic procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. When faced with an unsolvable problem, the brain gives up, leading to coping mechanisms like playing games or pornography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## The Solution: Shifting Focus to Personal Well-being

The key to overcoming this paralysis is to change the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Instead of focusing on external outcomes like finding a partner, the focus must shift entirely to [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | personal growth and self-awareness]] and [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | intrinsic worth]].

### The Paradox of Attraction and Authenticity

The speaker's personal experience illustrates this paradox: after getting married, he stopped worrying about dating and began interacting with people authentically, becoming a "warm and pleasant human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. By focusing on [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | being his best self]] without the agenda of finding a partner, he surprisingly began receiving female attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This highlights that [[balancing_personal_authenticity_with_public_perception | personal authenticity]] and a lack of desperation are inherently attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

### Letting Go of the External Goal

The only way forward when facing an overwhelming, seemingly unsolvable problem (like finding a relationship) is to "stop trying to fix it" in terms of that grand outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This doesn't mean becoming hopeless, but rather [[role_of_validation_in_personal_growth | changing the goal]] and grieving the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Instead of aiming for a relationship, ask: "Are you internally happy with your body?" or "Is this something you are happy with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. If not, change it for your own [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | intrinsic satisfaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. For example:
*   Seek surgery for a lazy eye or crooked nose if it affects your quality of life, not to attract someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   Go to therapy to [[building_selfworth_and_battling_negative_selfbeliefs | feel less broken and rejected]] for yourself, not to become more datable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   Go to the gym to [[selflove_and_overcoming_challenges | take pride in your body's capabilities]], not to impress others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

When the motivation for improvement is tied to external outcomes (like a relationship), any minor setback (e.g., someone being interested in someone else) can destroy that motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### Embracing Solitude and Internal Validation

A crucial aspect of healthy relationships is learning to be comfortable and [[personal_growth_and_selfacceptance | happy with yourself]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. A relationship makes life *harder*, not easier; the more grounded you are, the easier things become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

Life offers more than just relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. If relationships feel too challenging to pursue, let that goal go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. Grieve the idea of being alone for life, if necessary, and then focus on what *can* bring [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | pride and happiness]] in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. This includes [[building_selfawareness_for_personal_growth | becoming a better human being]], feeling less broken, and being happy with your physical self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

The mind's "scam" is its focus on the distant, overwhelming outcome, which destroys motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Instead, set small, insufficient goals. Don't try to climb a mountain; try to climb one step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. By letting go of the relationship goal and [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | focusing on yourself]], paradoxically, a relationship may come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

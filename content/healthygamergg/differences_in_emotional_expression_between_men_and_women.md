Therapy, particularly talk therapy, has historically been developed based on patterns observed in a patient population that is predominantly female. The majority of psychotherapy patients throughout history, and currently, are women (around 60-70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Similarly, about 60-70% of therapists today are also women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This has led to a potential systemic bias in how mental illness is diagnosed and treated, with a focus on approaches that may be more effective for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Differences in Diagnosis and Emotional Processing

The American Psychological Association acknowledges a systemic bias in how men and women are diagnosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>:
*   **Women's diagnoses** often involve feelings and the ability to articulate them, such as major depressive disorder (involving feeling sad) and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. [[differences_in_anxiety_between_men_and_women | Women are approximately two to three times more likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety than men]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Men's diagnoses** are frequently "externalizing disorders," such as addictions, sociopathy, or antisocial personality disorder, which primarily involve observable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This suggests that when men experience emotions, they tend to act on them rather than articulate or talk about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## Men's Approach to Emotions: Problem-Solving Over Articulation

For men, an emotion is often perceived as a problem to be solved, not something to be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This perspective is often reinforced from a young age:
*   If a boy is bullied and feels ashamed, he is taught to fix the problem (e.g., lose weight, learn martial arts) rather than cry or talk about his feelings, which might lead to further punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   If a man feels ashamed due to unemployment or financial struggles, the expectation is to find a job and make money, not to seek emotional support through conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This societal conditioning teaches men to address internal feelings by taking external action and changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Reluctance in Couples Counseling

This difference in emotional processing contributes to men's reluctance to engage in couples counseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Research indicates that this reluctance is not due to avoidance, but rather a feeling of being "outgunned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Men often feel their partners are much better at understanding and articulating feelings, enabling them to present their case more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. When a therapist asks about feelings, men may respond with "I don't know" because they feel they don't know how to effectively communicate emotions in the expected way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Unique Male Communication Styles

Men often communicate positive affection through negative expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. For example, when proud of a friend, men might tease them ("brah, GG Noob, you're whipped") rather than offering direct verbal affirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This is done while smiling, indirectly conveying appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional psychotherapy, where therapists are trained to listen and ask open-ended questions about feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. This can make men feel unintelligent or lost in therapy when asked "How do you feel about that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## Physical Expression of Emotions in Men

[[Physical expression of emotions in men | When it comes to emotional health, men are often very physical in their expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. For instance, after a breakup, a man might describe the emotional pain as "she ripped my heart out" or "she stomped on my balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Other men typically understand these physical metaphors for emotional distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

Physical activity is also a common recommendation among men for coping with emotional pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. "Hit the gym, baby" is a common response to being dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. This approach highlights a physiological aspect to improving mood that is often overlooked in traditional talk therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. The separation of mind from body in psychotherapy is a significant mistake, as emotions have profound physical ramifications (e.g., anxiety causing digestive issues or changes in blood flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. The physical component of emotional health is often more important for men compared to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This is an important consideration for [[role_of_hormonal_and_emotional_awareness_in_mens_anxiety | men's anxiety management]].

## Implications for Therapy and Emotional Health

Despite these challenges, psychotherapy remains an evidence-based and effective treatment for mental illness for both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. However, men may need to approach therapy with certain considerations:
*   **Finding the Right Fit:** It may be necessary to see multiple therapists to find one who can communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency with the Therapist:** Men can inform their therapist that they are not always aware of their feelings or good at articulating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. This might relate to "normative male alexithymia," where most men are less attuned to their internal emotional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.
*   **Requesting a Different Style:** Men can ask therapists to be more active, offer more guidance, or ask questions in a way that helps them understand their emotions better, rather than relying solely on open-ended questions like "How does that make you feel?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   **Considering Bodily-Oriented Approaches:** Since emotions often reside in the body, physical activities like Tai Chi and yoga can be effective for mood and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. Somatic therapies like EMDR or EFT (tapping), which incorporate the body, are also gaining interest and evidence for their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.
*   **Men's Groups:** The increasing trend of men's groups, which often involve physical rituals, hikes, and communication, also highlights the importance of physical components in men's emotional health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

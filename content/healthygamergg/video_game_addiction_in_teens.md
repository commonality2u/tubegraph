## Case Study: A 16-Year-Old Son's Struggle

A father describes his 16-year-old son's [[video_games_and_mental_health_exploring_addiction_and_community | video game addiction]], which has led to screaming, headaches, and a lack of productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The son had always enjoyed gaming, with a PS4 and iPhone being gifts several years prior, but it wasn't an issue until the year before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Escalation of Issues

Before the pandemic, the son began missing school, feeling unwell, and appearing moody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It was discovered he was staying up late playing games or watching content on his phone, leading to suffering grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. When the pandemic hit, he "pretty much gave up on school," doing only the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

During homeschooling attempts, he reverted to old habits within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The father grounded him from his PS4 and Switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, and his iPhone had broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Parental Conflict and Son's Resistance

The parents are divorced, and the son splits his time between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
A therapist suggested the son earn back privileges by admitting what caused their loss and proposing ways to earn them back, but he refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The father believes his son is resistant to therapy because "dialogue is not valuable in this relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

His mother, who shares custody, considered the father "too strict" and continued to allow TV watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The father suspects the son manipulated her to stay home from school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The son missed more school when with his mother than with his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

After the new year, the son claimed to have a persistent headache that prevented schoolwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Doctors and a headache specialist found nothing medically wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The father states the son is "mostly still on a messed up sleep schedule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The father later discovered his son was sneaking [[video_games_and_mental_health_exploring_addiction_and_community | video games]] on an old Game Boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This led the father to suspect the severity, or even existence, of the headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The son refuses therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The son feels he is treated unfairly compared to his older brother, who had more freedom in screen use but also earned good grades, worked, and had extracurriculars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The father told his son he would have the same freedom if he showed responsibility, noting his current "addictions to screens" were affecting his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The father questions if "even more hard love and more punishment" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Expert Analysis

### The Problem of "Fixing" and Power Struggles

The expert highlights that the father's approach is characterized by diagnosing a problem and implementing solutions (grounding, punishment, taking away games) without much dialogue or understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, leading to a "power struggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While the father is trying to do what he thinks is best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, this "fixer" mentality has paradoxically worsened the son's situation, from doing the bare minimum to claiming debilitating headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The son's behavior, such as sneaking the Game Boy, is seen as him "playing the same game" his father taught him: when faced with a problem, use available tools to "fix" it without dialogue or compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Psychosomatic Illness

The son's persistent headaches that cannot be medically explained are identified as a potential [[psychosomatic_illness | psychosomatic illness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This occurs "when the mind suffers and has no coping mechanism or outlet for that suffering, it manifests in the body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. By taking away the son's [[Gaming and its relationship with negative emotions | coping mechanism]] (video games) and punishing him more, the family conflict may lead to physical symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

The headaches serve as the son's "trump card" to avoid school, indicating that the underlying issue is not merely [[video_games_and_mental_health_exploring_addiction_and_community | video game addiction]] but potentially deeper struggles like depression, fear of school failure, ADHD, or pressure from his older brother's achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### The Importance of Alliance Building and Understanding

Parents in such situations often resort to "fixing and punishment," turning the relationship into a "toxic" power dynamic rather than collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. The expert stresses that "the kid is going to win any conflict between parent and child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, and even if the parent "wins," they ultimately lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

The recommended approach for parents is to:
*   **Support and Collaborate:** "Support your kid, collaborate with your kid, build an [[the_impact_of_video_games_on_family_relationships | alliance]] with your kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Understand, Don't Assume:** Instead of assuming the problem is a late sleep schedule, parents should ask what's going on and try to understand the underlying causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   **Ask for Consent for Help:** Parents should ask their child, "Can I help?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> and offer support for the child's own goals (e.g., going to college) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Set Healthy Boundaries and Teach Restraint:** Rather than restriction, parents should teach their children self-regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. A powerful question to gain a child's buy-in for accountability is to ask them in advance if they want to be held accountable for their stated goals even if they change their mind later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Allow Kids to Fail:** Parents often take responsibility for their child's success (e.g., nagging about grades), but this infantilizes the child and shifts responsibility from the child to the parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Allowing them to experience consequences teaches valuable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

### Modern Parenting Challenges

The expert notes that "old styles of parenting are insufficient" for today's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. Contemporary issues include rising rates of depression, anxiety, and [[video_games_and_mental_health_exploring_addiction_and_community | video game addiction]] (11% of under-18s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Unlike past games designed by enthusiasts, modern [[role_of_technology_companies_in_screen_addiction | video games]] are often designed by psychologists and behavioral economists to be addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. This creates an "uphill battle" for parents, who need updated strategies to support their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.

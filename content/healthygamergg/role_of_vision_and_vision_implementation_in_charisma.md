Developing charisma extends beyond physical attractiveness, which accounts for only 10.5% of the variance in charisma according to modern research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Three attributes are considered more significant: [[importance_of_communication_skills_in_charisma | communication skills]], attracting admiration and inspiring others, and being honest and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Half of the charisma people exude is comprised of these three aspects, unrelated to physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

To develop charisma, focus on three key areas: vision and vision implementation, [[authenticity_in_personal_charisma | authenticity]], and [[improving_communication_style_for_charisma | communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. By improving these, individuals will naturally find others more interested in spending time with them, even if they are physically unattractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Understanding Vision

Vision is distinct from traditional goals or targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. While society often emphasizes quantifiable achievements like sales targets or personal metrics (e.g., losing weight, earning more money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, vision is an abstract idea about the overarching direction of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. For example, instead of "sell flowers," a vision might be "we sell beauty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Developing Vision

Developing vision is challenging for several reasons:
*   **Societal Conditioning:** Institutions like schools actively condition out the instinct for vision. They operate as "factories" creating standardized individuals with standardized competencies, rather than fostering a personal vision for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of the World:** In a world perceived as "falling apart" with frequent crises, planning for the future through vision can feel pointless, as it might lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

Despite these difficulties, developing a vision is a fundamental part of increasing charisma, as scientific research confirms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Encountering someone with a clear vision for their life can be profoundly inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

### Cultivating Vision
To cultivate vision, individuals should:
*   **Eliminate Goals:** Shift focus away from concrete, measurable goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Ideals:** Think about abstract ideals they want to live towards, allowing for "floofy and uncalculated" thoughts that may have been previously dismissed as impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   "I want to live a life of health" rather than "I want to lose 5 pounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
    *   "My body is a temple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
    *   "Create a story that inspires people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
    *   "Capture suffering and share it with other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
    *   "Live a life that I can be proud of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

When a solid vision is established, it naturally aligns different aspects of one's life, making them appear organized and intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

## Vision Implementation
The implementation of one's vision is crucial and works in conjunction with having an ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. It involves three steps:

### 1. Clarification
Clarification involves deep introspection about the desired trajectory of one's life. Ask questions such as:
*   "What do I want my life to look like when I look back on it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>
*   "How do I want my life to be perceived by other people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>
*   "What would make me happy on my deathbed?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>

This process focuses on the ideals and direction, not specific targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. The more one engages in this introspective work, the more developed their vision becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

### 2. Structure
Structure involves defining the *where*, *when*, and *how* of living out your vision, rather than focusing on the *what* or specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. This emphasizes the process over the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. For example, if the vision is "to live a life of beauty," one might plan to "make some kind of artwork and present it on March 27th, 2024, at this particular community of local artists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

### 3. Strategic Thinking
Strategic thinking means consistently moving towards your vision, especially when faced with setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>. While people are often strategic in professional contexts (where [[impact_of_ego_and_selfperception_on_motivation_and_actions | emotions]] and ego are less involved), they struggle to apply this to personal life due to emotional responses to adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

Instead of letting setbacks define the future, strategic thinking involves asking:
*   "How can I move past this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>
*   "How can I circumvent whatever has just happened and continue moving towards my vision?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>

This approach is about a relentless, forward-moving strategic process, not necessarily achieving a specific goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. When others observe this perseverance and unwavering movement towards a vision, it becomes a powerful source of attraction and admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

By developing a clear vision and consistently implementing it through clarification, structure, and strategic thinking, individuals can significantly improve their charisma, irrespective of their physical attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. This approach can boost charisma by approximately 44% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>, as suggested by literature in business and psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>.

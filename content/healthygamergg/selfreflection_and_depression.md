It is proposed that high [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | self-awareness]] can be part of the problem in [[understanding_depression_personal_experiences_and_medical_insights | depression]], a concept supported by scientific evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Default Mode Network (DMN)

The brain contains a region known as the Default Mode Network (DMN), which is responsible for the human capacity for [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | self-awareness]] and [[courage_and_selfreflection | self-reflection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This network is a key distinction between humans and animals. For instance, a deer searching for food does not experience self-deprecating thoughts if unsuccessful, but a human might feel like an "idiot" in a similar scenario due to the capacity for [[courage_and_selfreflection | self-reflection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The DMN enables "meta-level thinking" about oneself and one's actions within the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## DMN and Depression

The presence of the DMN, evolutionarily speaking, also brings the possibility of [[understanding_depression_personal_experiences_and_medical_insights | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Studies indicate that individuals experiencing [[understanding_depression_personal_experiences_and_medical_insights | depression]] have overly active Default Mode Networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

In a non-depressed state, a minor setback (e.g., being rejected by two people) might not activate the DMN. However, if repeated (e.g., ten rejections), the DMN can activate and generate negative self-thoughts, such as "maybe you're ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This is seen as a meta-level problem-solving mechanism, prompting self-evaluation to improve chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

When a person is depressed, their DMN is highly active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This hyperactivity causes even tiny, unrelated situations to become perceived as personal failures or problems, leading to intense self-blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This can manifest in thoughts like "my family would be better off without me" or "I'm a waste of space," where the mind constantly views the self as the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The continuous focus on "I" – with the individual being the object of their own attention – is neuroscientifically correlated with [[understanding_depression_personal_experiences_and_medical_insights | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Treatment Implications

Novel treatments for [[understanding_depression_personal_experiences_and_medical_insights | depression]], such as ketamine, offer insights into the DMN's role. Ketamine, a dissociative agent, can rapidly improve depressive symptoms within hours, unlike traditional antidepressants that take weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The key mechanism is that ketamine shuts off the Default Mode Network, allowing individuals to "separate from yourself" and stop being "stuck in myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Similarly, other hallucinogenic substances like psilocybin and MDMA, currently undergoing trials, are believed to cause a "cosmic sense of connection" by shutting off the DMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This process separates individuals from the self-focused thinking, allowing the mind to pull back from constant [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | self-awareness]] directed at the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ketamine and other hallucinogens are substances of abuse and should not be used recreationally. They can have dangerous side effects and should only be administered under the guidance of a physician in a licensed and prescribed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Fracturing the sense of self can also be traumatic and potentially lead to PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

When the sense of self is "fractured" by these substances, the continuous self-reflection ceases, alleviating the problem of excessive [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | self-awareness]] and leading to improvement in [[understanding_depression_personal_experiences_and_medical_insights | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

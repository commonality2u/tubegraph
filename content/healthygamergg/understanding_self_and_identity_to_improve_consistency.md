To [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | develop consistency in your life]], particularly as a gamer, the core issue is not a lack of motivation, discipline, or willpower, but rather an [[understanding_self_and_identity_to_improve_consistency | ignorance of who you truly are]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Many believe they are living their own life, but instead, they are "constantly spawning into some random dude's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Recognizing this can significantly ease the process of [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | developing consistency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Fluctuating Self and Avidia

This insight aligns with discoveries made by yogis in the Himalayas thousands of years ago, who identified *avidia* (ignorance of our true selves) as the source of suffering and problems in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. You inherently know you're not the same person every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. You might recall a past period of high productivity and wish you could consistently be "that person," but the "you" actually fluctuates considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This fluctuation runs deeper than just desires and emotions, affecting values and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Life as a Multiplayer Game

If you desire [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | consistency]], you must first accept that "you don't exist beyond today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Your life is akin to a multiplayer game where different "random people" wake up in your life each day and live it one day at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Often, the "you" of today tends to "screw over tomorrow you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This is why tasks are put off with the thought, "I will do it later," but it's not the same "you" who has to do it laterâ€”it's the next "guy or girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This behavior stems from a lack of recognition that you are only in charge for this moment in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. When there's no conception of the future or sense of stewardship, individuals tend to negatively impact the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Neuroscience of Future Discounting

This phenomenon is supported by neuroscience, specifically a human brain tendency called "future discounting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Our brains are wired, particularly the nucleus accumbens, to value immediate rewards more than distant ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This wiring explains why we, as a species, fundamentally procrastinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### The Custodian Mindset

To counter this, you must understand that you are inheriting this life from the person who came before you and are a custodian for the person who comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

*   **MOBA Game Analogy**: Imagine playing a MOBA game for only five minutes, as a temporary replacement for a friend. Even if you won't experience the joy of winning, you would still try to play the best game possible to set up the next player for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Games go wrong when a temporary player, upon facing early setbacks, decides the game is lost and intentionally sabotages it for the next player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Instead, one should ask: "How can I play this game to improve things for the person who comes next?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Top Chef Analogy**: In a Top Chef challenge, teams of chefs cooked in relay, with each chef working for five minutes before passing the dish to the next. Each new chef had to deduce the previous one's intent and continue the process optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Living your life as if you are merely a custodian for today, not expecting to "win" at the end, paradoxically helps [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | build consistency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. You start to ask: "What kind of life do I want to set up for the person tomorrow?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Self-Compassion

A crucial aspect is [[understanding_and_addressing_selfesteem_issues | self-compassion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. If you don't [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | love yourself]], there is little point in making sacrifices for your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. We make sacrifices for things and people we deem worth it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. If you don't love yourself, it becomes very difficult to make sacrifices today for a better tomorrow, as you wouldn't care about the person inheriting tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Ultimately, to live a life of [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | consistency]], you must paradoxically recognize that there is no inherent [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | consistency]] within you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. You only get to live today, and you cannot dictate tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Accept that you are a temporary custodian, constantly spawning into this person's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Then, consciously decide if you want to set things up better for the next "you" or create a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The problem is thinking there *is* consistency and that you can make up for things tomorrow, which proves impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This [[building_selfawareness_for_personal_growth | self-awareness]], understood through gaming analogies, helps grasp the ancient principle of *avidia* leading to suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

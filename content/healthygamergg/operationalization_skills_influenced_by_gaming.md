Years or even decades of gaming can impact an individual's brain, potentially leading to specific neurological deficits that affect real-world problem-solving abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Operationalization Deficit

One significant way video games influence the brain is by handling "operationalization" for the player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. In video games, everything is clearly laid out:
*   A main quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>
*   Side quests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>
*   A mini-map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>
*   Clearly defined rules and mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>
*   External resources like websites and YouTube tutorials to guide actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>

The game essentially "holds your hand" from start to finish, dictating what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. However, real life does not operate this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

Gamers often develop a specific deficit: they struggle to operationalize problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This means they cannot take an abstract goal, like becoming financially independent, and break it down into manageable, actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Brain Atrophy and Deconditioning
This inability stems from the fact that games have performed this function for players for so long that the corresponding brain circuits begin to atrophy and wither <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Just like any muscle or skill, if a particular brain functionality isn't used, it becomes deconditioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

### Impact on [[gamers_and_realworld_challenges | Gamers and Real-World Challenges]]
Gamers often struggle with moving forward in life because they don't know how to approach large, abstract goals such as:
*   Being happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>
*   Achieving financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>
*   Finding a romantic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>

They may search for "quest markers" or clear rules for real-life interactions, like seeking an "animation point" to approach someone they are attracted to or checking their "reputation" before interacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. This leads to a misconception that they are lazy or procrastinating, when in fact, the root issue is often not knowing how to get started on a task because their brain is accustomed to being told exactly what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Reversing the Deficit

The good news is that these deficits are not "baked into the character" like a game trait but are changeable neurological patterns induced by gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Gamers can learn to operationalize problems again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

### The "Split into Two" Exercise
A simple cognitive exercise to re-develop operationalization skills involves breaking down abstract tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, similar to how a long main quest in a video game is divided into checkpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

> "Anything that you want to accomplish... can you do it right now? The answer is no, okay. So this is what you're good at, we're going to leverage your strengths to overcome your weaknesses, take that task and split it into two parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

**Example: Becoming Financially Independent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>
1.  **Goal**: Become financially independent (can't do it right now).
2.  **Split 1**: Retire, Get a Job (can't retire, can't get a job right now).
3.  **Split 2 (from "Get a Job")**: Have a Job, Apply for a Job (can't apply for a job right now).
4.  **Split 3 (from "Apply for a Job")**: Go to an Interview, Submit an Application (can't submit an application right now).
5.  **Split 4 (from "Submit an Application")**: Have a Resume, Research Jobs (don't have a resume).
6.  **Split 5 (from "Have a Resume")**: Find a template, Do some research, Make a list of activities (can now do one of these within five minutes).

> "Unless you can do something within five minutes and have that task done, I want you to break that apart into two pieces and you keep on breaking it apart and what you're gonna end up with is a main quest quest line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

This process will result in a multitude of very small, minute tasks, similar to delivering an item to a villager or hunting boar tails in a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. By engaging in this formal cognitive process of operationalizing problems, individuals can begin to reverse these neurological deficits and remove the "XP penalty" on their learning and progress in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

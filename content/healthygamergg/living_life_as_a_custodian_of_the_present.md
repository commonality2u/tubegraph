Developing consistency in life, particularly for gamers aiming to "level up" stats like motivation or discipline, is often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The core problem with achieving consistency isn't a lack of these traits; it's a fundamental misunderstanding of one's own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Illusion of a Consistent Self

The idea that we are not consistently the "same person" day-to-day is an ancient discovery made by yogis in the Himalayas thousands of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. They identified *avidya*, or ignorance of our true selves, as the source of suffering and problems in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

You likely recognize this fluctuation in yourself; you might wish you could be the highly productive person you were on a particular day in the past, but the "you" who wakes up today is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Our desires, emotions, values, and even the choices we make fluctuate, leading to inconsistency in the life we are crafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This is why many people long to return to a "former version" of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

### Life as a Multiplayer Game

Instead of a single-player journey, consider life as a multiplayer game where random individuals "spawn into" your life each day and get to live it for one day at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The problem is that the "you" of today often "screws over tomorrow you" by procrastinating and leaving tasks unfinished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. When you wake up the next day, you're angry at the "person" who came before you for not completing necessary tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This behavior is similar to how public toilets are often left in disarray because users don't feel a sense of stewardship for the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

### The Science of Procrastination

Our brains are wired for immediate gratification, a concept known as "future discounting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. The nucleus accumbens, a part of our brain, values immediate rewards more than distant ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This inherent wiring explains why we tend to procrastinate, choosing immediate pleasure over future benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

## Embracing the Custodian Mindset

To develop consistency, one must accept that they don't truly "exist beyond today" in the sense of being the *same* consistent self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Instead, you are a temporary custodian of your life, inheriting it from the person who came before you and being responsible for the person who comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

This perspective shifts life from a "body swap comedy" where you spend everything without consequence, to one of responsibility for the next "player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

### Analogy: The MOBA Game

Consider playing a MOBA game where you only play for 5 minutes before someone else takes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. Even if you won't experience the victory, you would still try to play your best to improve the game for the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Games go wrong when players give up due to a bad start, intentionally "screwing over" the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Similarly, in life, connecting present actions to a specific outcome can lead to "tilting" and losing control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

Instead, ask yourself: "As a custodian of this game for the next five minutes, how can I improve things for the person who comes next?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This is the mindset for living your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

### Analogy: The Top Chef Relay

In a "Top Chef" challenge, a team of chefs makes a dish in a relay, each working for five minutes before passing it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Each chef must understand the previous chef's intent and continue the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Living life this way, accepting that you are just a temporary custodian for today and won't see the "win" at the end, will paradoxically lead to greater consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

## The Role of Self-Compassion

This approach requires [[balancing_giving_with_selfcare | self-compassion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. If you don't [[finding_purpose_and_meaning_in_life | love yourself]], why would you make sacrifices today for a better tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>? We make sacrifices for things we love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. If you don't care about the person inheriting tomorrow, you'll continue to create a mess for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

To achieve consistency, paradoxically accept that there is no inherent consistency within you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. You only get to live today, and you are a temporary custodian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. The question then becomes: "How do I want to live this life today? Am I going to set things up better for the person who's going to inherit tomorrow, or create a mess?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. This perspective, though bizarre, connects gaming principles to the ancient wisdom of *avidya*, helping us navigate life's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

Masturbation, an act often associated with moral failing or inability to engage in sexual relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, has a complex history of medical and cultural views. Today, it is also discussed in the context of emerging online phenomena such as "gooning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Defining Gooning

Gooning is described as "Min maxing" the act of masturbation to its maximal level, often involving "edging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This practice, growing in "the nether regions of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, involves intentionally prolonging sexual stimulation without reaching orgasm, then slowing down, and repeating this process to enhance the overall experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Participants may even create "goon caves" with multiple monitors and specific ambiance like incense to optimize the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Historical Medical Views on Masturbation

Historically, attitudes towards masturbation have varied significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Early Perspectives (1600s)
Some perspectives in the 1600s suggested that masturbation could be beneficial. One individual from that era believed it was a good method for "strengthening the penis of young boys in order to make them better able afterwards to procreate" by "pull[ing] on the penis vigorously and repeatedly in order to make it longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Negative Views (18th-19th Centuries)
Attitudes shifted significantly with figures like Swiss doctor Tissot, whose 1839 medical text detailed the supposed dangers of masturbation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

According to Tissot, excessive masturbation (referred to as "venial excess" or "onanism") led to various physical and mental ailments:
> "One of the most constant effects of excessive masturbation is the loss of Flesh the loss of Flesh and strength is not the only symptom of consumption which undermine gradually the onanist... the countenance instead of the Vermilion glow of health is pale and without freshness or of a yellowish earthy lead in livid taint the lips lose their color a Bluer Circle surrounds the eyes the eyelids are puffed out with edema the flesh is soft and flaccid the pulse is small and feeble upon the slightest motion or during sleep the forehead chest and Palms of the hands are bathed with profuse perspiration in some patients the hands and feet are emitis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Tissot also described mental and emotional effects:
> "the heart and mind suffer as much as the body from excess masturbation the onist experiences for dissembling his tastes and for concealing a habit which is both ridiculous and vile renders him taciturn... his eyes are turned from The Gaze of those around he loves Solitude avoids the world is and is embarrassed and is almost as if it as it were ashamed of himself his manner might sometimes pass for timidity we might almost say for innocence but is it is entirely changed when being in the company with a profess onist he no longer feels restrained" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
He further noted "a sensation of sadness and eny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, and feelings of "regret and remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This portrayal essentially described a "sweaty nerd" or "angry nerd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, often resembling the modern perception of an "Internet troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. It's noted that these descriptions primarily concerned men, as medical understanding of female masturbation was limited in 1839 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## The Neuroscience of Sexual Pleasure

Modern understanding of sexual pleasure involves the interplay of the [[neuroscience_of_sexual_pleasure | nervous system]]. The sexual system is a combination of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) and the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Normally, only one system is active at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, in sexuality, both are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Erection, for example, is primarily facilitated by the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to blood flow into the penis (or clitoris) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. As the sympathetic nervous system activates during arousal, one-way valves close, trapping blood and maintaining the erection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Threshold to Orgasm
Sexual pleasure can be conceptualized by a "threshold to orgasm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. As sexual stimulation increases, one moves closer to this threshold, crossing which leads to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

This threshold can be modified:
*   **Decreased threshold:** If one hasn't had sex in a while, the threshold decreases, making it easier and faster to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Increased threshold:** Certain medications like SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) can raise the threshold, interfering with the ability to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This effect is sometimes utilized to help patients with premature ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Maximizing Pleasure: "Area Under the Curve"
The "total pleasure" extracted from a sexual act can be thought of as the "area under the curve" of stimulation versus orgasm threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. A quick orgasm, while intense, may result in a shorter experience and less total pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

*   **Drugs:** Substances like alcohol and marijuana (CNS depressants) slow down brain activity and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, increasing the threshold to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This allows for a higher degree of stimulation and a longer sexual act, leading to a greater "area under the curve" or total pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. However, excessive use can raise the threshold too high, preventing orgasm entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Fetishism and Foreplay:** Practices like fetishism and foreplay involve non-genital stimulation that allows individuals to move along the pleasure curve without immediately reaching the orgasm threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This prolongs the arousal phase, increasing the total amount of pleasure experienced, similar to how drugs extend the sexual act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Masturbation, particularly quick sessions, is often a direct path to orgasm, yielding a smaller "area under the curve" compared to sex with foreplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Gooning:** Gooning, by involving edging, aims to "Min max" sexual inputs by intensifying stimulation without achieving orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This process of delaying orgasm and allowing other circuits to "kick in" can potentially raise the orgasm threshold over time, allowing for a significantly enhanced "area under the curve" when orgasm is finally achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding Gooning and Hyper-Stimulation

While the direct effects of gooning are not yet studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, there are concerns that exploiting natural biological systems for maximal pleasure may lead to negative consequences. Parallels are drawn to highly processed foods like Twinkies, which exploit the natural preference for high-fat, high-sugar foods to the detriment of health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Similarly, video games exploit human desires for identity and achievement through artificial tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

The primary concerns related to gooning include:
*   **Increased Loneliness:** Maximizing [[Impact of pornography and masturbation on sexual relationships | sexual pleasure]] independently in a "goon cave" may disincentivize connection with other human beings, potentially reinforcing loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Interference with Sexual Relationships:** Intensive masturbatory behaviors, especially with pornography, can condition the body to a "supernormal stimulus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. This can make real-life sexual experiences less stimulating, potentially leading to issues such as not being able to achieve orgasm through vaginal intercourse due to the body being conditioned to a specific kind of stimulus (e.g., [[Challenges with sexual experiences and common problems like death grip syndrome | "death grip syndrome"]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

While potentially enjoyable, hyper-activating parts of the brain and body through such practices may not be healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

Dealing with parental disapproval can be a challenging aspect of relationships. It often involves understanding the root causes of their disapproval, effective communication, and maintaining confidence in your choices.

## Understanding Parental Disapproval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>
Parents may disapprove of a partner for various reasons, including career success, religious beliefs, cultural background, or perceived character flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. It's crucial to understand the specific reasons behind their objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

### Cultural Factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>
For Indian immigrant parents, there can be a "pecking order" of acceptability for partners, often based on:
*   **Profession:** Highly valued professions include doctoral degrees, banking, finance, medicine, and law. Engineering and computer science are also gaining acceptance. Family-run businesses are generally highly regarded, while fields like art may be seen as less legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.
*   **Ethnicity:** Preference for partners from the same state, caste, or linguistic background. Other Indian ethnicities, followed by Caucasian or Asian individuals, may also be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.
*   **Religion:** Strong preference for partners of the same religion. For Hindu families, Judaism may be considered the most acceptable non-Hindu religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

It's important to recognize that these preferences are often shortcuts for parents to assess a person's perceived success and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.

### Distinguishing Valid Concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>
While some parental disapproval stems from prejudice (e.g., race, religion, ethnicity), it's important to differentiate this from valid concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. Parents often have more life and relationship experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. Listen to their concerns about your partner's actions or treatment of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. For example, if a partner is not professionally settled and your parents struggled financially, their concerns may be valid, reflecting their past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Dealing with Disapproval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>

### Confidence in Your Choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>
Demonstrating confidence in your partner can significantly influence your parents' acceptance. If you are confident and serious about your choice, and your partner isn't trying to prove anything, parents may take to them instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This confidence can alleviate parental anxieties and make them more at ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### Open Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>
*   **Directly communicate your choice:** Clearly state your feelings and intentions to your parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Discuss shared values:** Focus conversations on the values your partner embodies and how they align with what is important to you, even if external labels differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **Inquire about their values:** Ask your parents why certain attributes (race, religion, profession) are important to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
*   **Utilize specific settings:** Having difficult conversations in a car can be beneficial as it reduces the pressure of direct eye contact and provides a captive audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.

### Working with Parental Values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>
It's possible to work with your parents to help them understand and potentially shift their values closer to your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. This may involve a gradual process of demonstrating your perspective and preferences.

### Managing Family Conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>
When family members, like siblings, disapprove of your partner, it's wise to consider their reasons, as there is often a valid basis for their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>. Engage in direct conversations with your partner about their actions, especially if there are controlling tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14:00">[44:14:00]</a>. Recognize that in some cultures (e.g., South and East Asian), the family unit's importance may outweigh individual rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>. Understanding cultural differences can help navigate these dynamics.

### Accepting and Moving On <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>
If a relationship is consistently struggling despite efforts, and especially if it feels like a bad relationship being prolonged due to time invested, it may be time to reconsider. Do not "throw good time after bad time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:57:00">[46:57:00]</a>. A healthy, long-term relationship requires more than just love; it needs sacrifice, aligning incentives, and mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:44:00">[47:44:00]</a>. Sometimes, love alone is not enough for a relationship to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:02:00">[48:02:00]</a>.

For children becoming providers for their parents, balancing the relationship involves acknowledging the shift in responsibilities. Parents need to begin respecting their children as equals or colleagues rather than dependents, and open communication about financial management and household dynamics becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

Being perceived as a gifted child can often lead to [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | perfectionism burnout]], depression, anxiety, unfulfilled expectations, and a lack of real interests or goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While often seen as an advantage, giftedness can sometimes be a burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Gifted children are considered "special needs" children because their needs are different from the average child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Parents and educators who recognize this and provide a slightly different structure, curriculum, or way of raising them tend to do a better job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Without appropriate treatment, gifted children may struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## Common Challenges for Gifted Children

### Lack of Study Habits
School is where children learn not only subjects but also socialization and [[strategies_for_managing_motivation_and_focus | study habits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. For gifted children, school tends to be easy, allowing them to get by without studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This perceived advantage actually sets them up for failure later because they never develop the disciplined study techniques needed for higher levels of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. When their raw intellect is no longer sufficient to handle schoolwork, they hit a "hard cliff" and struggle significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This can lead to [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | perfectionism and burnout]] as they know they're smart but don't understand why they can't perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

### Burden of Expectation
Gifted children are often told from a young age that they are special, smart, and have much potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This creates very lofty goals in their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Society often assumes that gifted individuals will find things easier and need to work less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. However, living up to a gifted child's potential typically involves **more work**, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
The analogy given is that building a mansion (potential) requires far more effort than building a shack (average achievement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Gifted children may put in the same effort as their peers but expect a "mansion" while only having put in "shack-building" effort, leading to confusion and feelings of inferiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

### Shame and Low Self-Esteem
The gap between high expectations and actual accomplishments leads to shame and [[perfectionism_burnout_and_selfesteem_issues_in_gifted_children | low self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. This "shame gap" grows larger as the discrepancy between potential and performance increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. Shame can further compound and hinder motivation, contributing to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Gifted kids may develop an ego around being smart, leading to avoidance of situations that might challenge this identity, such as attending a community college if they believe only "stupid kids" go there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Support

### 1. Stop Comparison
The concept of "gifted" is inherently comparative, existing only in relation to those who are "not gifted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. Gifted children often constantly compare themselves to others, leading to self-doubt and unfulfilled expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. Many of their expectations are not self-derived but are based on external comparisons, which inevitably leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

> "You can't ever base the expectations of your life and what you're capable of based on what someone else is doing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>
>
> The first thing a gifted kid must do is "let go of all comparison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

### 2. Embrace the Long Road
Achieving high potential is a long and often "rough" journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. Just as building a mansion takes longer than building a shack, fulfilling greater potential requires more time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. Gifted individuals may take a "scenic route" in life, which might include academic setbacks or needing more time to achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. It's crucial not to expect immediate results or visible progress; the "mansion" will not have its form for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. Seeing less immediate return on effort compared to peers can shatter motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.

> Be patient with yourself and "try your best not to compare to other people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>

### 3. Lower Expectations and Practice Acceptance
The "shame gap" between expectations and accomplishments can be addressed in two ways:
1.  **Meet the high expectations:** Successfully achieve all goals, such as attending an Ivy League school or starting a successful tech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>. This is often an unrealistic or difficult path.
2.  **Lower expectations through acceptance:** By accepting what one is truly capable of, the shame gap diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. Even if this means accepting perceived "failure," the shame will dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. Accepting oneself as they are, acknowledging that their current achievements are exactly what they've been capable of, can surprisingly boost motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

### 4. Challenge Gifted Children More, Not Less
A key strategy for parents, teachers, and managers is to challenge gifted individuals appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>. Gifted children often gravitate towards engaging activities like video games because games perfectly match the pace of the child and offer consistent challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>. In contrast, school often moves at the pace of the slowest person, leading to boredom and a lack of engagement for gifted students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.

> When a gifted child fails, the biggest mistake is to "slow down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. Instead, they need a **bigger challenge**, not an easier environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>. This assumes no underlying ADHD, depression, or learning disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>.

*   **Provide appropriate challenges:** Stick them in internships, give them complex problems, or put them in positions of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>.
*   **Encourage self-directed learning:** If they don't know something, tell them to "Google it and learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>.
*   **Have faith:** Instead of imposing external expectations, express faith in their ability to handle challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>. Encourage them to give their best shot, accepting that failure is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:00]</a>.

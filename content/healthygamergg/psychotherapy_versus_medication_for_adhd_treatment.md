Both [[adhd_therapy_and_management | psychotherapy]] and medication are effective in treating Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with studies showing they can improve focus and outcomes by similar amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:49">[15:21:49]</a>. However, there are significant differences in their long-term effects and the underlying mechanisms of their benefits.

## Duration of Effect
A key distinction between the two approaches lies in the persistence of their effects:
*   **Medication**: If medication is stopped, its effects typically dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:08">[15:38:08]</a>.
*   **Psychotherapy**: The benefits of [[adhd_therapy_and_management | psychotherapy]] can last for up to two years after treatment has concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:03">[15:43:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:10">[15:45:10]</a>. This sustained benefit occurs because [[adhd_therapy_and_management | psychotherapy]] equips individuals with practical skills to manage their condition.

## How Psychotherapy Works
[[adhd_therapy_and_management | Psychotherapy]] teaches individuals with ADHD how to function effectively in the world despite having distractible attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:03">[15:52:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:02">[15:54:02]</a>. This includes developing [[strategies_for_managing_adhd_symptoms | organizational skills]] and [[developing_personalized_strategies_to_manage_adhd | compensatory mechanisms]].

### Key Strategies Taught in Therapy
*   **Calendar and To-Do List Mastery**: Learning to effectively use calendars and to-do lists for [[strategies_for_managing_adhd_symptoms | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:18">[16:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:07">[16:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:08">[16:08:08]</a>.
*   **Material Organization**: A crucial tip is to gather and organize all necessary materials for a task *before* starting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:03">[16:11:03]</a>. This prevents distraction from searching for information online during the task, which can lead to getting "screwed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:04">[16:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:08">[16:38:08]</a>. All work materials should be organized with calendars, alarms, and other systems to protect against ADHD tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:07">[16:42:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:07">[16:44:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:04">[16:47:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.
*   **Training Executive Function**: Meditation can also be used to train executive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:04">[18:15:04]</a>.

## Addressing Self-Belief and Confidence
A significant part of [[adhd_therapy_and_management | psychotherapy]] for ADHD involves addressing the individual's self-perception and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:04">[17:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. Growing up with untreated or undertreated ADHD often leads to feelings of inadequacy, such as "I am not enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:04">[10:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:07">[13:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:07">[13:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:07">[19:05:07]</a>.

This pervasive belief can sabotage efforts to improve in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:07">[17:33:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:07">[17:35:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:09">[17:37:09]</a>. A therapist can help individuals with ADHD by treating the patient as if they have [[the_relationship_between_adhd_and_depression | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:07">[17:57:07]</a>, focusing on rebuilding their belief in themselves to change their perspective on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:09">[17:59:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:04">[18:00:04]</a>. This "one-two punch" approach combines organizational skill-building with confidence work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:07">[17:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:07">[17:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:07">[17:52:07]</a>.

### Why Self-Blame Persists
Individuals with ADHD often intellectually recognize external stressors (e.g., studies, lack of breaks), yet struggle to connect these to their fatigue, instead blaming themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:07">[10:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:07">[14:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:07">[14:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:07">[14:09:07]</a>. This self-blame is rooted in years of learning that "something is wrong with me" due to undiagnosed or misunderstood ADHD symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:07">[14:47:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:07">[14:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:07">[14:52:07]</a>.

Children with ADHD, often as smart as their peers, observe their struggles with attention, forgetting homework, or inability to focus on reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:07">[11:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:07">[11:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:07">[11:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:07">[11:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:07">[11:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:07">[11:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:07">[11:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:07">[11:29:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:07">[11:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:07">[11:34:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:07">[11:37:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:07">[11:39:07]</a>. In the absence of a compassionate diagnosis and explanation, they conclude there is "something fundamentally wrong with me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:07">[12:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:07">[12:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:07">[12:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:07">[12:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:07">[12:13:07]</a>. They believe they are not trying hard enough, rather than understanding their attention is simply different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:07">[13:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:07">[13:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:07">[13:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:07">[13:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:07">[13:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:07">[13:23:07]</a>. This deep-seated belief system clashes with current intellectual understanding, causing continued self-blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:07">[14:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:07">[14:59:07]</a>.

## Overall Strategy
To effectively manage ADHD and the resulting fatigue, a combined approach is often recommended:
1.  **Develop Organizational Tools**: Learn and implement [[developing_personalized_strategies_to_manage_adhd | organizational skills]] and workflow strategies to protect against ADHD tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:07">[19:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:07">[19:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:07">[19:14:07]</a>.
2.  **Work on Confidence**: Address underlying self-blame and build confidence, often with the help of a therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:07">[19:21:07]</a>.
3.  **Consider Medical Consultation**: Consult a medical doctor for hormone checks or to discuss [[stimulant_vs_nonstimulant_adhd_medication | medication]] options if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:07">[18:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:07">[18:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:07">[18:26:07]</a>.

By learning to study and work with a distractible mind and improving self-confidence, individuals with ADHD can perform as well as neurotypical individuals, by "playing the hand they're dealt" instead of attempting to copy neurotypical behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:07">[19:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:07">[19:29:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:07">[19:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:07">[19:34:07]</a>.

Doc describes a profound sense of detachment from his own life, often feeling as though he is living in "third person" or merely observing his own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>. He feels largely uninvested in his own journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:44">[03:14:44]</a>, preferring to focus on helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:08">[03:06:08]</a>. This perspective highlights a complex interplay between his past traumatic experiences, his evolving self-identity, and the way he approaches all forms of relationships.

## Disconnected Self-Identity

Doc explains that he is not "invested in his own life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a> and gains happiness primarily from helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. He uses a gaming analogy, stating he no longer has a "main quest" and only engages in "side quests" for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:13">[04:52:13]</a>. He compares himself to a "Yuumi support" in a game, someone who helps others achieve their goals rather than pursuing his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. This shift occurred over the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>; previously, he had a "drive" and "own goals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

This state of living in a "third person" perspective is identified as depersonalization, a psychological concept where an individual feels detached from their own body, thoughts, or feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. Doc describes it as "remote controlling myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>, feeling like he is the player controlling a character, rather than the character itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:34">[01:34:34]</a>. This is a survival mechanism that allows the mind to "unplug from traumatic situations because they hurt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:03">[01:36:03]</a>. He also refers to himself as an "NPC in other people's lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:59">[01:36:59]</a>, further emphasizing his lack of a personal main quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.

## Self-Perception and Early Life Experiences

Doc describes himself as a "narcissist who also hates himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, explaining this paradox through his social intelligence. He believes he has a unique ability to connect with and understand people, asserting that he is a "prominent person" in any friend circle not because he seeks attention, but because he deeply gets to know others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. He feels a sense of pride in his ability to get along with "pretty much anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. This self-perception of superior social acumen leads him to sometimes view others as "plebs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, not in a derogatory sense, but as those who don't grasp the deeper nuances of social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

His self-hatred stems from his past, specifically a perceived "glow up" from being "unattractive inside and outside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. During middle school and early high school, he felt "nothing he could do to make people like him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. He learned to "copy normies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, essentially molding himself to be more palatable to others, influenced by a popular friend who lived in the same apartment complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This friend explicitly told him he wouldn't have liked Doc if they hadn't lived in the same building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>, reinforcing the idea that Doc was not "worth liking" for who he truly was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

Doc's early life was marked by instability and a pervasive feeling of being unwanted:
*   **Absent Biological Father** He was an "anchor baby," conceived so his Moroccan father could gain German citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. His father only contacted him when he needed something, such as using Doc to prevent his own deportation from Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Mother's Inconsistency** Raised initially by a single mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, Doc felt he had to "educate" and "care for" his own mom due to her naivete and tendency to repeat relationship mistakes, marrying men who used her for financial gain or visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. At one point, his mother sent him to live with his grandparents, prioritizing her younger sister and her "own life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Childhood Exclusion** In a small village, rumors about his mother led parents to tell their children not to play with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This exclusion, coupled with teachers bullying him in front of the class, made him feel "nothing about me that's interesting enough to ever make like any meaningful connections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This continuous bullying, rather than the later tragedy, is what "sticks more" in his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a> because it made him feel "there's nothing desirable about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. Even as an adult, he avoids social outings due to the fear of making a mistake and being perceived as "weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>.

### The Tragic Turning Point

Doc's mother found a "very nice man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a> who brought a sense of normalcy and love into their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This stepfather genuinely loved his mother and was a positive father figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. However, his mother's extreme jealousy and erratic behavior caused immense strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Eventually, the stepfather's love "seared like my family's entire fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a> because, unlike others, he didn't distance himself when treated badly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>. Doc helped reconcile them after a fight, believing things would improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. However, the stepfather later murdered Doc's mother and then committed suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>. Doc witnessed the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

This event felt like his "main quest" had been "yoinked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>, leaving him wondering "what is the point of progressing on a main quest that ends like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. He feels a deep conflict, hating the stepfather for his actions, yet grappling with the fact that this person was also the first true father figure in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. The stepfather's suicide denied Doc the opportunity to direct his anger, and the fact that the stepfather sought a hug from Doc just hours before the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>, and then omitted Doc from his suicide note while mentioning others, highlights the selfishness and further complicates Doc's feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.

## Impact on Relationships

Doc's personal history has profoundly affected his [[navigating_longterm_relationships | romantic relationships]]. He has had many relationships since becoming more "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>, but rarely felt genuinely romantically invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. He often said yes to dating someone to avoid seeing them cry, not because of genuine attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>. These felt more like "friendship plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>.

He experienced a unique connection with someone he describes as a "mental twin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>, leading to a relationship despite incompatible sexual orientations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>. This relationship was the only time he felt genuine infatuation, and he has been unable to feel it since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>. This struggle is linked to a deeper issue: he has become "almost completely unable to feel any sort of sexual attraction to people anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>. Previously, intimacy provided a sense of "desirability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:58">[01:30:58]</a>, but now it feels uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>.

This inability to genuinely connect romantically is tied to his deeply ingrained feeling of being "unlovable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>. If he were to let himself fall in love, and that person found him unlovable, it would be "the final nail in the coffin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:13">[01:43:13]</a> of the hope that he might be truly lovable. He believes he would need to be "very very comfortable" with someone to allow himself to fall in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:55">[01:41:55]</a>.

## Coping and Resilience

Despite the immense trauma, Doc has developed coping mechanisms. He uses humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a> and masks his emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a> to avoid alienating people, drawing a clear distinction from his uncle who uses tragedy to elicit pity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>. He consciously chooses to present his stories as "interesting" rather than seeking sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

A significant source of his current "goal-oriented" behavior is taking care of his younger sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. He sees her as "who I would be if I didn't have any problems at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:01">[01:52:01]</a>, and feels immense pride in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:14">[01:52:14]</a>. Being her "father" figure and "best friend" provides him with a sense of importance and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:33">[01:52:33]</a>. He acknowledges that having a supportive group of friends, both in-person and online, has also been crucial for coping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:11">[01:49:11]</a>.

## Path Forward

Doc has been diagnosed with PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>, and his depersonalization is a key symptom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. It is recommended that he seek professional therapy to process his trauma and begin the journey of "making life real again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>. He also needs to learn to "love again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:37">[01:46:37]</a>, which involves confronting his core belief of being unlovable.

Applying concepts from Advaita Vedanta, Doc's experience with conflicting emotions (e.g., hating his stepfather but also valuing him) can be seen as an "artificial construction of the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>. The path to [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | personal growth]] involves accepting that seemingly contradictory feelings can coexist and ultimately transcending these dualities to reach a state of pure existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>. This challenging "main quest" requires Doc to work through his past, dismantle his deep-seated belief that he is unworthy of love, and allow himself to fully re-engage with his own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>.

Tiredness is the number one emotion people report feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While it may seem counterintuitive to consider tiredness an emotion, it is a complex phenomenon with both mental and physiological dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Is Tiredness an Emotion?
Often, tiredness is perceived purely as a physical state, linked to a lack of sleep or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, people can feel [[mental_and_physiological_dimensions_of_tiredness | mentally tired]] or find life lacks zest even if they are not depressed, burnt out, or experiencing sleep deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This suggests that tiredness is not solely a physiological condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The shared human experience of being able to feel tired implies it serves a particular function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Emotions, including fear or anxiety, are information from the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Similarly, tiredness, as an emotion, provides information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. It is important to understand *why* we feel tired to comprehend its function, rather than viewing it merely as a negative state to eliminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Emotions are both physiological and psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Physical manifestations like lumps in the throat or butterflies in the stomach are physiological correlates of emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Since tiredness is often experienced in the body, it is reasonable to conclude that it is not exclusively physiological but also psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## The Mental Dimension of Tiredness
Tiredness can manifest suddenly, even when one has had adequate sleep and nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, simply seeing a phone call from a demanding parent or boss can immediately trigger feelings of exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This sudden onset, even without physical exertion, points to its mental nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Tiredness is an [[the_evolutionary_purpose_of_tiredness | adaptive mechanism]] created by the brain to help avoid useless work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. It is the brain's response to the perception of a high workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. When the brain estimates a task, like paying taxes or writing a dissertation, as requiring immense effort with unclear chances of success or visible progress, it makes us feel tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

This mechanism evolved to prevent individuals from expending energy on endeavors with low probabilities of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Tiredness acts as a signal to "don't do it, don't bother, don't try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. It is an [[neuroscience_of_motivation_and_fatigue_grooves | energy conservation strategy]], designed to discourage investment in long-term, questionable activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

For instance, anticipating emotionally draining situations, such as holiday visits with divorced parents, can evoke tiredness because the brain perceives the effort as a waste, given the unlikelihood of satisfying everyone's emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Similarly, avoiding a phone call by silencing it does not involve physical exertion, yet the perceived emotional burden of the call can lead to exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Understanding and Overcoming Tiredness
To [[strategies_to_overcome_feelings_of_tiredness | understand tiredness]], it is crucial to identify the specific scenarios in which it arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. When feeling exhausted, ask: "What is my body telling me not to do?" and "Why is it telling me not to do it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This inquiry helps uncover the underlying reasons, which are often psychological rather than purely physical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Recognize that there may be nothing physiologically wrong; tiredness can simply be a signal or information from the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. It indicates that a part of you perceives the task as a waste of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Consider how you would feel after completing the "tired-inducing" task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. If your mind calculates that despite effort, you will still feel bad or far from completion (e.g., after two hours of taxes, there's still "so much left to do"), it might disincentivize starting at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

Productivity techniques like chunking a large, abstract task into smaller pieces can help mitigate this feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. By setting achievable small goals (e.g., reading one chapter instead of 100), the brain re-evaluates the effort as worthwhile, making you feel less tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

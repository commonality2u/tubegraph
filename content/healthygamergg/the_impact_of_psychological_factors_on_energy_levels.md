Observations from a community emotional tracking event revealed that "tired" was the number one emotion reported by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This raises questions about the nature of tiredness: Is it solely a physiological state, a lack of sleep, or can it be a mental or emotional experience? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Tiredness as an Emotion and Information

While commonly viewed as purely negative or a sign of physical depletion, tiredness can also be understood as an emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. All human beings share the experience of feeling tired, suggesting it serves a particular function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Emotions are fundamentally information from our brain and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, signaling something about our internal state or external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The experience of tiredness is not exclusively physiological; it has a significant psychological dimension. For example, individuals might feel completely rested physically, yet experience sudden exhaustion triggered by the sight of an unwanted phone call from a parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> or an email from their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This sudden feeling of exhaustion, even without physical exertion, indicates a mental component to tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### The Brain's Adaptive Mechanism

Tiredness is an adaptive mechanism evolved by the brain to help avoid "useless work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. When the brain perceives a task as having a very high workload and unclear chances of success or visible progress, it induces tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This serves as an [[physiological_causes_of_tiredness_and_energy_management | energy conservation strategy]], discouraging investment in long-term, questionable endeavors with low probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

For example:
*   **Administrative Tasks** Seeing tasks like paying taxes can trigger tiredness because the brain estimates a high workload with no immediate completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Projects** Similarly, the idea of writing a dissertation, which takes a year, can lead to feeling exhausted because the brain perceives the immense effort and lack of immediate completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Social Interactions** Encountering people who might demand emotional energy or resources (like a family member with high emotional needs or a street canvasser) can instantly lead to a feeling of exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The brain signals to avoid the interaction because it anticipates a draining, unfulfilling outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

The sensation of tiredness is thus a natural response to tasks perceived as overwhelmingly difficult to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. It is the brain signaling, "Don't bother, don't try, stop; I'm not going to give you the energy for such a rare, difficult thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Overcoming Psychological Tiredness

To overcome psychological tiredness, it's crucial to understand why the brain is signaling this emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

1.  **Notice the Scenario:** Pay attention to when and why you suddenly feel tired. What specific scenario or thought triggers this feeling? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
2.  **Interpret the Signal:** Recognize that tiredness is information. It's your body telling you *not* to do something, or that a part of you perceives the action as a waste of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
3.  **Question the Outcome:** Ask yourself, "If I were to do the thing that makes me feel tired, how would I feel at the end of it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   If you genuinely anticipate feeling good (e.g., after exercising or making progress on taxes), the tiredness signal indicates a distorted perception from your brain.
    *   If your mind predicts feeling terrible or that progress won't be enough, it's a "disincentive" to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This self-sabotaging calculation needs to be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
4.  **Chunk Large Tasks:** Breaking down large, abstract tasks into smaller, achievable pieces can reduce the perceived workload and increase the immediate sense of accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This changes the brain's calculation, making it less likely to trigger the "waste of energy" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
5.  **Set Boundaries in Relationships:** When tiredness arises in social contexts, it may signal that you perceive an interaction as an emotional drain with no positive return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Understanding this allows you to set boundaries or change your approach to avoid feeling constantly drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

By understanding tiredness as an emotional signal tied to our brain's calculations of workload and potential success, individuals can begin to address its psychological roots rather than just seeking physiological solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

This article explores why individuals might become overly clingy or invested in relationships, leading to partners pulling away or ghosting, and how to navigate feelings of [[struggles_with_selfworth_and_selfesteem | self-blame]] and take constructive responsibility. The discussion centers on a 30-year-old man's experience of repeatedly driving people away due to perceived clinginess and obsessive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Root Causes of Clinginess and Self-Blame

The individual's patterns of being guarded, secretive, and obsessive in relationships stem from a traumatic childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This included being bullied by family, told he was an "embarrassment," had the "wrong personality," or was an "oaf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. He recounts being asked to list people who would attend his hypothetical funeral to "prove" no one would mourn his death, and being accused of lying when spending time with friends because it was "unbelievable that anyone would like" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This led to feeling that "relationships were guessing games where I was always the loser" and becoming a loner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

This upbringing imprinted a deep sense of unworthiness, making him feel responsible for others' opinions and affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. When a new relationship doesn't go as expected, he tends to [[struggles_with_selfworth_and_selfesteem | blame himself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A history of being ghosted fuels a "fearful and baseless" suspicion that others are trying to break contact, even when circumstances (like a partner getting busy) explain reduced communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This isn't baseless, as past experiences validate the feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## The Cycle of Clinginess and Withdrawal

A common pattern emerges:
1.  **Initial Connection**: A new relationship starts well, with both individuals clicking quickly and enjoying a natural, low-investment connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
2.  **Partner's Reduced Availability**: The partner becomes busier in their personal life, leading to less frequent communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety Activation**: This change triggers the individual's underlying fears and anxieties, rooted in past [[coping_with_feelings_of_unlovability | feelings of unlovability]] and past ghosting experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The fear that "what my parents told me all along is true" (that no one wants to be their friend) becomes active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
4.  **Increased Clingy Behavior**: To alleviate this anxiety, the individual responds by sending increasingly long and frequent texts, "almost as if to remind her I still existed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This is an unconscious request for the partner to fix the anxiety by providing reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
5.  **Lack of Communication**: These emotional needs are not verbally addressed with the partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The texts carry a desperate, unstated message of "Don't forget about me; I exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
6.  **Partner's Confusion and Withdrawal**: The partner, unaware of these deep-seated emotional needs, becomes confused and overwhelmed by the intensity of the texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Their responses grow shorter, and they eventually block the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
7.  **Reinforcement of Negative Beliefs**: The blocking reinforces the individual's deepest fears that they don't deserve friends and will never exist in anyone's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Friends' well-meaning reassurance ("you did nothing wrong") can, paradoxically, prevent the individual from recognizing their contribution to the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Responsibility vs. Blame

It's crucial to distinguish between blame and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. While the individual is not a "bad person" and their behavior is "excusable" given their traumatic programming, taking responsibility for their 50% contribution to the relationship's outcome is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

> "You can't have agency without responsibility. Responsibility doesn't come without agency. If it's my respect if I have the power to win, then I also have the power to lose. And so if I get credit for the win, I also have to take credit for the loss." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>

Recognizing personal contribution allows for the power to change things, breaking the repeating pattern of ghosting and loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Getting Stuck in Your Own Head

A core issue is getting "stuck in your own head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This is akin to trying to dance with someone while listening to a different song on headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The individual operates from their own internal anxieties and narratives (the "different song"), while the partner is trying to engage with the actual reality of the relationship (the "waltz") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Without communicating these internal experiences, the partner cannot understand or respond appropriately, leading to confusion and withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Strategies for Healthy Relationships

To cultivate [[selflove_and_overcoming_challenges | healthier relationships]] with oneself and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>:

*   **Understand Emotions and Their Influence**: Become aware of the emotions (e.g., anxiety, fear of abandonment) that arise when a partner pulls away, and how these emotions drive specific behaviors like excessive texting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Process Underlying Feelings**: Work to process the core feelings of not existing in another person's life or being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Reducing the "fuel in that fire" will naturally reduce the clingy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Simply forcing oneself not to text will only build tension, leading to an eventual uncontrolled release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Communicate Emotional Needs**: Successful relationships require that emotional needs are understood by the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Instead of sending long, desperate texts, communicate the underlying feelings and needs directly.
*   **Practice Letting Go**: If a partner chooses to leave, allow them to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Recognize that people part ways for many reasons, often unrelated to one's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Not being compatible with everyone is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. The goal is a relationship where the other person *wants* to be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Address the "Luggage"**: The inability to make or keep friends leads to excessive attachment to potential friends, burdening new relationships with past anxieties and unresolved issues ("luggage") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. This "luggage" drives people away, perpetuating the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Seek Professional Support**: To offload this emotional "luggage," consider therapy or coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Group coaching is particularly beneficial for practicing communication, setting boundaries, and understanding how to interact in healthy ways without resorting to "games" or unstated demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. This allows individuals to vocalize feelings, understand themselves, and connect with others more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

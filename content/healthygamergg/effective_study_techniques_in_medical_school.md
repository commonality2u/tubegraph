The ability to effectively [[understanding_how_the_mind_works_for_effective_studying | internalize beliefs]] and information, particularly when the subconscious resists, is crucial for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This concept extends to academic performance, where merely reading information from a textbook does not guarantee understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The key difference between reading and truly comprehending lies in the state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Personal Experience in Medical School

The speaker, having investigated how information sinks in, was able to study only two hours a day during medical school, a significant contrast to friends who studied five, seven, or even eight hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This efficiency was not due to being a "genius" but from understanding and applying specific [[strategies to improve attention and productivity | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## The Importance of a Calm Mind

The primary differentiator for effective learning is the "state of mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. When the mind is active, agitated, or distracted—like if a library is burning down or one has just gone through a breakup—it requires significantly more effort (e.g., reading a page ten times) to process and understand information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

> [!info] Analogy: The Pool of Water
> Imagine the mind as a pool of water with dirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. To see to the bottom (the subconscious), the water needs to be still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Mental activity stirs up the "dirt," preventing new information from sinking in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Calming the mind allows information to be planted deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Practical Strategies for Academic Success

### Optimal Study Timing
The speaker found that waking up between 4:00 and 4:30 AM and studying from 4:30 to 6:30 AM or 5:00 to 7:00 AM was most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This early morning period, when the mind was "completely clear," allowed for maximum [[techniques_for_improving_focus_and_attention | focus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Pre-reading and Class as Review
A highly effective [[strategies for improving focus and reducing distractions | strategy]] was to pre-read the material that the class would cover that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This transformed class into a review session rather than an initial exposure to new material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This approach made learning significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Incorporating Yoga Nidra and Sankalpa
To achieve a calm mind and facilitate deep learning, the practice of Yoga Nidra is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Yoga Nidra is a potent technique for easily achieving a "super calm mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

A core component of Yoga Nidra is the "Sankalpa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. A Sankalpa is a statement made about oneself, planted deeply into the subconscious when the mind is calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This is akin to "rewriting the code of your subconscious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. When negative thoughts bubble up, instead of fighting them, one plants an inspirational alternative through a Sankalpa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

> [!example] Choosing a Sankalpa
> A Sankalpa should be a reflective, long-term reinforcement (e.g., for a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Examples include:
> - "I deserve to cut myself a break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>
> - "I deserve to be whole" (used with a patient suffering from trauma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>
> The specific Sankalpa should align with the desired personal "buff" or improvement, whether it's self-forgiveness, motivation, or otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

## Scientific Backing

Even aside from the spiritual aspects, there is overwhelming [[scientific_evidence_supporting_meditation_for_improved_academic_performance | scientific evidence]] that regular meditation improves [[techniques_for_improving_focus_and_attention | attention]], concentration, and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The speaker himself initially relied on scientific support when choosing meditation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Therefore, consistently calming the mind through practices like meditation can lead to an improvement in academic performance, such as a higher GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

A former [[understanding_the_incel_label | incel]] shared an experience of having sex for the first time at 32, which proved to be a gross and unfulfilling experience, contrary to expectations after a two-year self-improvement journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This individual's post highlights the significant gap between societal and [[understanding_the_incel_label | incel]] fantasies about sex and the reality of the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## The Fantasy vs. Reality of Sex

[[understanding_the_incel_label | Incels]] often harbor a fantasy of what sex is like, believing that once they achieve it, their problems will vanish, and they will transform into a "Chad" figure, leading to an amazing life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Society, too, places a "bizarre value" on sex, portraying it as a threshold to confidence, wealth, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. However, this romanticized view fails to capture the complexity and often awkward reality of sexual encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

> "Sex is fantastic, we also think that it's great every single time like man I got laid it was so awesome dude like oh my God like oh man getting laid like oh my God laid laid laid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

> "We definitely romanticized the idea of sex. We also romanticize the idea of both being a virgin and no longer being a virgin, right? We attach all kinds of different like myths and and other kinds of like things to sex." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>

### Common Myths about Sex
*   **Myth #1: The first time is always amazing.** Often, the first sexual experience is awkward, painful, or unfulfilling for many, especially women, as partners may not know how to bring them to orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Movies and media perpetuate this myth with dramatic, perfect portrayals of first encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Myth #2: Every time is amazing.** Like cooking, sex can be amazing, but it requires practice and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Myth #3: Sexual activity alters vaginal elasticity.** The notion that a woman's vagina becomes "loose" from having sex with multiple partners is physiologically incorrect; the body is elastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of pornography and masturbation on sexual relationships | Impact of Pornography and Masturbation]]

The individual's experience highlights the [[impact_of_pornography_and_masturbation_on_sexual_relationships | impact of pornography and masturbation]] on real-life sexual encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. After 18 years of masturbation, the individual's body had been conditioned to a specific type of stimulation, leading to issues like "death grip syndrome" where the grip strength and lack of lubrication used during self-stimulation differ significantly from vaginal intercourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. This conditioning can make real-life sex feel unsatisfying or difficult to achieve orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

### Death Grip Syndrome
This condition results from the body being physiologically conditioned to a specific masturbatory technique, requiring a certain grip strength and lubrication level to achieve climax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. When confronted with vaginal intercourse, which provides less grip strength and more lubrication, the body may not respond as it has been trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

To address this, individuals can:
*   Use more lotion during masturbation to simulate the lubrication of intercourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.
*   Practice a looser grip during masturbation to re-train the body to respond to less intense stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Psychological and Emotional Challenges

A negative first sexual experience, especially one that doesn't meet romanticized expectations, can lead to psychological problems, shame, and a sense of being "messed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. This can lead individuals to question their sexuality, such as wondering if they are asexual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

:::warning Asexuality Misdiagnosis
Having a negative sexual experience does not automatically mean one is asexual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. It could simply mean the body needs reconditioning or more experimentation to figure out what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. Forums, while supportive, might inadvertently reinforce a self-diagnosis of asexuality, potentially leading individuals to miss out on exploring their sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.

### Patience and Support are Key
The speaker emphasizes the importance of patience and experimentation in sexual discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. The individual in the post was fortunate to have a supportive partner who was emotionally available and patient, which is invaluable in navigating this journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Sexual exploration can involve various erogenous zones and combining different forms of stimulation, much like balancing flavors in cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. Sex therapy can provide detailed guidance on transitioning between different types of stimulation to achieve satisfaction, even if it's not perfect initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

Ultimately, sex is a practice that takes time, experimentation, and open communication to develop and enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

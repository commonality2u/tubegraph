Long-term relationships require significant effort, understanding, and mutual support to thrive. Dr. K and his wife, Mrs. K (also known as Cruy), share insights from their 17-year relationship on managing expectations, handling challenges, and fostering growth together. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## The Foundation of a Lasting Partnership

Dr. K and Cruy have been together since 2003, meeting shortly after Dr. K considered becoming a monk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> Their relationship navigated through college, Dr. K's efforts to get into medical school, and periods of long-distance, including Austin to Boston and Boston to New York. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> They got engaged when Dr. K was accepted into medical school, a condition set by Cruy to ensure he had a clear life path. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

Their journey highlights that a successful long-term relationship is built on shared purpose and a willingness to overcome obstacles together. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

## Managing External Influences

### Parental Disapproval

Dealing with parental disapproval of a partner is a common [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | challenge in dating and relationships]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> Cruy introduced Dr. K to her parents when his future was uncertain, but her unwavering confidence in him influenced their acceptance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> She advises that demonstrating confidence and faith in your partner can help parents feel more at ease. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

Dr. K also faced initial hesitation from his father about Cruy, but his father ultimately supported his choice if he was sure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

**Factors influencing parental approval (especially in Indian culture):**
*   **Professional acceptance:** Parents often prioritize partners with doctoral degrees or high-earning professions like banking, finance, medicine, law, engineering, and computer science. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> Successful family-run businesses are also highly regarded. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   **Ethnic and religious background:** There's a pecking order of acceptability based on state, caste, language, and then broader ethnic groups (e.g., Caucasian, Asian) and religions (e.g., Judaism for Hindus). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>

**Strategies for addressing parental disapproval:**
*   **Communicate values:** Talk to your parents about your shared values with your partner, emphasizing that underlying values are consistent even if labels (profession, religion) differ. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>
*   **Listen to concerns:** It's important to listen to parents' concerns about a partner's character or actions, as they may have valuable insights from experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a> Discount concerns based purely on race, religion, or profession if they don't align with your values, but seriously consider behavioral concerns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>
*   **Ongoing dialogue:** Maintain an open and continuous dialogue with your parents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>
*   **"Car conversation" strategy:** Have difficult conversations in a car, as it allows for talking without direct eye contact, reducing tension. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>
*   **Confidence in your person:** Convey to your parents that this is "your person" and you are confident in your choice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>

### Integrating Family and Partner

When a partner clashes with family members, it's crucial to understand the underlying reasons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a> For instance, if a partner discourages family contact, it can be a controlling behavior, or it might stem from deeply ingrained cultural values where the family unit (parents) takes precedence over the individual couple. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>

It's vital to discuss cultural values and expectations in the relationship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a> If a partner's actions consistently don't align with your interests, it might be time to reconsider the relationship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>

## Core Principles of Long-Term Relationships

### Sacrifice and Mutual Growth

Long-term relationships are not about constant 50/50 equality, but rather about taking turns giving more. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a> As Dr. K explains, "at any point in time one person is going to be putting more into that relationship." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>

Cruy made career sacrifices to support Dr. K's medical school and residency, moving to Boston when her career prospects were better elsewhere. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> They prioritized Dr. K's career advancement as a unit, understanding that "if you're going to be equal at each step of the way, neither of you is going to get what you really achieve." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>

This dynamic allows for one person to pursue their dreams, with the support of the other, knowing that the contributions balance out over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a> The goal is for two people to be "better together than either of you on your own." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>

### Monogamy vs. Non-Monogamy

The decision of whether a relationship should be monogamous depends on what individuals want. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>
Building a life together, raising children, and navigating complex issues (finances, family, etc.) is challenging enough with two people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a> Dr. K and Cruy emphasize the importance of having a partner who is "in your corner" with undivided loyalty, making the complexities of life more manageable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>

While it's possible to love multiple people (like parents love their children), the practicalities of managing joint lives, loyalty, and resources in polyamorous romantic relationships are complex and often lead to unhappiness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a> If the primary goal is companionship and building a life, monogamy can offer stability and clarity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>

Ultimately, whether to be monogamous or not is a personal choice, and people should "do what's best for you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>

### Attachment vs. Love

*   **Attachment** is often about dependence, possessiveness, and feeling tied to something. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>
*   **Love** is more encompassing and not necessarily possessive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>

While there can be overlap (e.g., healthy possessiveness within a loving relationship), both are not inherently healthy or unhealthy; their nature depends on the context and individual dynamics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>

## [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | Challenges in Dating and Relationships]]

### Dating Someone with Low Self-Worth

Cruy initially suggests avoiding starting a relationship with someone struggling with low self-worth, advising them to "fix the self-worth and then go to dating." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a> However, Dr. K offers a counterpoint, suggesting that a stable relationship can help people gain self-worth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>

**Advice for dating someone with low self-worth:**
*   **Be supportive, not a therapist:** You can show a partner their worth and be patient, but their journey to gaining self-worth is ultimately their responsibility. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>
*   **Set expectations:** After a few months, it's reasonable to have a conversation if self-worth isn't improving. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>
*   **Relationships are mutual upliftment:** The purpose of a relationship is for both individuals to become "better together." If one person is constantly pulling the other up, it's not a healthy balance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>

### Disapproving Friends and Family

When friends or siblings express disapproval of your partner, it's worth considering their reasons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a> While not every "assholery" in a relationship warrants a breakup, persistent issues noted by loved ones should prompt a conversation with your partner about their behavior. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>

### When to [[when_to_end_a_relationship | End a Relationship]]

*   **Love vs. Fear:** If the primary reason for staying together is fear of being alone or fear of hurting the other person, rather than genuine love and mutual growth, it may be time to reconsider. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>
*   **"Polar opposites" as a complement:** Being polar opposites is not inherently a reason to break up, as differences can be complementary and lead to mutual strengths, like a "fighter and a healer" in a team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>
*   **No longer a priority:** If you are consistently treated as unimportant or not a priority by your partner, it tells you everything you need to know about the relationship's value to them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a> Don't waste your time trying to change this. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>
*   **Sunk cost fallacy:** Don't continue a bad relationship just because you've invested a lot of time into it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:45">[01:46:45]</a> "Don't throw your good time after bad time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:57">[01:46:57]</a>
*   **Love is not enough:** While love is important, a healthy long-term relationship also requires sacrifice, aligning incentives, and active listening. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>
*   **"It shouldn't take work" mindset:** If a partner believes a relationship shouldn't require effort, it's a significant red flag, as healthy relationships are built on continuous work and investment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:37">[02:51:37]</a>

### [[the_process_of_letting_go_in_relationships | The Process of Letting Go in Relationships]]

*   **Emotional and intellectual recognition:** Acknowledge that you don't want to invest in a relationship where the other person isn't investing equally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:20">[02:52:20]</a>
*   **Grieve the loss:** Treat the end of the relationship like a death and allow yourself to grieve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>
*   **Seek new connections:** To move on, actively look for new people to connect with, whether romantically or socially. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:21">[02:55:21]</a>

### Managing Personal Issues in Relationships

*   **Low self-acceptance and self-validation:** Identify the root cause of lost confidence (often due to unfair treatment by others). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:22">[03:07:22]</a> Confidence is an internal quality not gained from external validation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a> Spending time in nature can help build internal confidence as nature is non-judgmental. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11">[03:09:11]</a>
*   **Social anxiety:** Recognize that your brain might misinterpret social situations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a> Don't act on anxious thoughts or try to "clear the air" unnecessarily; push through initial awkwardness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>
*   **Overthinking and neediness:** Neediness often stems from an internal "hunger" for validation that others can only temporarily satisfy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:07">[02:47:07]</a> Work on building your own sense of value internally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:18">[02:48:18]</a> A sounding board (therapist, friend) can help process these feelings before they impact relationships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:44">[02:48:44]</a>
*   **Autism and social cues:** If you suspect you're on the autism spectrum, seek formal evaluation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a> Training can help develop social skills to compensate for challenges in reading cues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:16">[03:05:16]</a> Being open about your challenges with a potential partner can foster connection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>
*   **Past mental health issues:** When a relationship becomes serious or exclusive, it's appropriate to share past mental health experiences like psychosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a> This information can be vital for your ongoing health, as a supportive partner is often a protective factor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a> If a partner cannot accept this, they are not the right person for you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a> Frame it as a dialogue, not a confession, allowing the other person to say yes to supporting you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>

### Conflict and Communication

*   **Apologies as appeasement:** Don't apologize solely to calm someone down if you genuinely believe you've done nothing wrong. Apologies should come from genuine wrongdoing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:38">[02:00:38]</a>
*   **Gender and arguments:** Being right or wrong in an argument has nothing to do with gender. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:16">[02:00:16]</a> A relationship where one person is always right is abusive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:27">[02:01:27]</a>
*   **Timely communication:** Address issues as they arise, even if it feels awkward, rather than letting resentment stew. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>
*   **Discussing issues in calm moments:** Some issues, like recurring conflicts amplified by external factors (e.g., PMS), are better discussed when both parties are level-headed and not emotionally activated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>

### Balancing Career and Relationships

*   **Individual balance:** The balance between dating and career is individual. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:59">[01:32:59]</a> Generally, career occupies certain hours, and dating occupies others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>
*   **Long-term vs. short-term:** In long-term relationships, priorities shift. It's often hard for two people to have the "career of their dreams" simultaneously, requiring one partner to sacrifice for the other's advancement, with the understanding that this balances out over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>

### Keeping the "Flame" Active

*   **Acceptance of flux:** Understand that the "flame" or intensity of a relationship will naturally fluctuate, especially during different life stages (e.g., after having children). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>
*   **Conscious effort:** While relationships take work, don't rely solely on basic efforts to "stay connected." Actively try to "recapture the circumstances" when the flame was brighter, such as through flirtation, learning, and growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:15">[01:56:15]</a>
*   **"Acts of love":** Go beyond mere "support" to perform intentional "acts of love," especially during difficult times for your partner (e.g., hormonal shifts, stress). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>

## Key Takeaways

*   **Confidence is crucial:** In yourself, your partner, and your decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
*   **Relationships are not always 50/50:** They require reciprocal sacrifice and mutual upliftment, balancing out over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>
*   **Communication is vital:** Have honest conversations, sometimes in unconventional settings (like a car), and understand the difference between expressing feelings and assigning blame. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>
*   **Don't ignore red flags:** Especially when a partner is consistently unkind to others or attempts to control you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:47">[01:52:47]</a>
*   **"Nice guys" vs. "Good guys":** Being "nice" is often a performative front; being "good" is about genuine character. Seek goodness over niceness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>
*   **Personal growth is ongoing:** Continue to grow, learn, and address your own insecurities, as this strengthens your ability to have a fulfilling relationship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:42">[03:57:42]</a>
*   **Understand your own value:** Don't rely on a partner to define your worth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:23">[02:48:23]</a>
*   **Don't fall for shortcuts:** Long-term relationships require work, regardless of how "perfect" they may seem on paper. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:48">[02:53:48]</a>

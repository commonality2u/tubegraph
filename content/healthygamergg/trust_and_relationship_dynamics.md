Trust issues can stem from repeated disappointments in relationships, leading to a negative perception of people and a fear of meeting new individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. When trust is given freely and not reciprocated, or when it leads to betrayal, it can be hard to continue trusting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## Molina's Experience with Trust Issues

Molina describes a period of significant disappointment, feeling that many people have turned out to be mean or dramatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This has led her to feel that it is difficult to trust people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> and has made her scared to meet new people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. She feels she no longer sees the positivity in people as much as she used to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

Her experience often involves relationships that start well, with her offering help and happiness, only for the other person to act in a mean or hurtful way, making her feel used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>, describing these as "lopsided" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.

## Open Relationships and Trust

Molina is in an open relationship with her fiancé, Destiny, which means they can see other people romantically and sexually outside their primary relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. She clarifies that polyamory typically means having feelings for and dating multiple people, while their current "open" dynamic means they are dating each other but can have romantic or sexual relationships with others without living with them, emphasizing the term "non-monogamous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

Her motivation for an open relationship is to allow her partner to "experience multiple things in life and not just me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. She finds happiness in the idea that Destiny can also give happiness to other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.

However, this dynamic has led to significant challenges, with other individuals involved often becoming jealous and trying to sabotage her relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>. She recounts instances of people being "really mean" and trying to make her feel bad, such as shutting a door in her face while with Destiny, or suggesting they are "the one instead of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. This feels unfair because she extends generosity and does not engage in such behaviors herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>.

The situation is likened to a child not sharing their eggs, despite readily taking from someone else's plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>. The primary boundary in their open relationship is that any additional partners must respect their main relationship and not attempt to sabotage it or express hatred towards one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>. Molina finds it sad when others do not adhere to this, causing her to lose hope in people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>.

### Monogamy vs. Polyamory: Control vs. Choice

Molina perceives monogamous relationships as inherently controlling, particularly regarding a partner's feelings for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>. However, a different perspective suggests that monogamy is not about [[healthy_vs_unhealthy_relationship_dynamics | controlling feelings]], but rather about **choice** and [[independence_and_relationship_decisions | controlling one's actions]] for the sake of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. People can have romantic or sexual interests in others, which is normal, but they choose not to act on those impulses to support their primary relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:55:00">[38:55:00]</a>.

It is suggested that polyamorous relationships may statistically offer less protection from being hurt due to the increased number of people entering and leaving the relationship dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>.

## The Giver Archetype and Emotional Impact

Molina is characterized as a "giver" and a "fixer," someone who strives to make people around her happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. This tendency is linked to the Hindu concept of "Shakti," which represents feminine energy, often associated with a maternal, giving force that draws others in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. Individuals with this quality are seen as a "light" that people are attracted to, often because they freely give their energy in a world where it's not commonly reciprocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.

This giving nature, however, can lead to lopsided relationships where the giver feels used and taken advantage of, as others come to "take your radiance" or absorb your energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. Molina confirms this, stating she feels like people are using her and that her relationships often become one-sided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>.

### Impact of Childhood Experiences

Molina's giving nature appears rooted in her childhood. Her mother was described as depressed, dramatic, and emotional, often burdening her children with her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>. From a young age (around six or seven), Molina felt responsible for taking care of her mother and making her happy, essentially becoming her "therapist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Her father, conversely, would withdraw when faced with negative emotions, leaving Molina to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. This upbringing fostered a dynamic where she had to suppress her own negative feelings and focus on maintaining happiness for both parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

Her current happiness in her nomadic lifestyle in New Zealand and her deep connection with Destiny, who traveled across the world to visit her, is contrasted with her mother's prioritizing a random friend over spending time with her children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. This suggests that Destiny's actions provided the validation and prioritization her mother often withheld.

## Navigating Current Challenges and Future Outlook

Molina expresses feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of her current life, including the long-distance relationship due to COVID, paperwork issues, and the drama within the streaming community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. She feels a lack of time to process events and fears going in the "wrong direction" or not being strong enough to endure future difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. The ongoing "drama on Twitch" where she feels she doesn't belong is a significant source of distress, as she joined primarily to spread happiness through her adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.

### The Ram and Krishna Analogy: Good vs. Happy Life

An analogy from Hindu tradition contrasts two incarnations of Vishnu:

*   **Ram:** Represents the ideal human being – noble, kind, honest, and giving. His story illustrates prioritizing the needs of his kingdom over his personal desires, even divorcing his faithful wife Sita due to public distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. Ram would not do bad things for good reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Living like Ram leads to a "good life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.
*   **Krishna:** While also a divine incarnation, Krishna is more pragmatic, willing to bend rules and even do "shady things" if the "ends justify the means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. He prioritizes his own goals and outcomes, even if it means acting against conventional morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Living like Krishna leads to a "happy life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.

Molina identifies more with Ram, being a giver who prioritizes others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. However, this path, while "good," can lead to suffering, as the world is full of people who will take advantage of givers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

## [[Understanding and changing relationship patterns | Strategies for Change]]: Embracing Selfishness and Boundaries

For Molina to live a happier life and mitigate her suffering, she is encouraged to become "a little bit more selfish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>. This means:

*   **Prioritizing personal well-being:** Acknowledging that sacrificing one's health and well-being for others is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.
*   **Setting boundaries:** Being mindful about when and how to give, ensuring it's under her control, not others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. This applies to her streaming presence and her open relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>.
*   **[[Healthy communication in relationships | Communicating feelings]]:** Expressing pain or discomfort to her partner, Destiny, rather than suppressing it to keep him happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. This involves sharing feelings and allowing him to make choices, as a [[navigating_longterm_relationships | healthy marriage]] requires mutual giving (60% from each, leaving 40% for receiving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>.
*   **Reframing "selfishness":** Challenging the belief that being selfish automatically means neglecting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a>. There's a wide spectrum where self-care doesn't equate to neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:36">[01:56:36]</a>.
*   **Reserving "mana" for self-development:** Allocating time and energy for personal growth and understanding, rather than constantly pouring it into others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a>. This might involve setting boundaries and informing others about personal time.
*   **Managing [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | emotional needs]] as a sponge:** Recognizing that being an empath means absorbing others' pain. The key is not to stop absorbing, but to learn how to "wring out the sponge" through [[strategies_for_building_trust_and_understanding_between_parents_and_children | emotional support systems]] (friends, family, therapists) and practices like meditation or yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is for Molina to recognize her tendency to put others first and neglect her own needs, a pattern that started in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>. By acknowledging and addressing this, she can achieve a more balanced and peaceful existence, integrating her loving nature with self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>.

[[touch_starvation_and_emotional_struggles | Touch starvation]] is a prevalent issue, with many individuals, including those who are neurodivergent and might typically dislike physical touch, still longing for it, creating a particularly challenging situation where their body needs touch but their somatosensory cortex prevents engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This societal deficiency is highlighted by current trends such as a loneliness epidemic, worsening mental health indicators, and a significant rise in the percentage of people who have never been in romantic relationships, never had sexual relations, or have zero friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Physiology of Touch Starvation

The impact of touch extends beyond subjective experience, involving significant physiological responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Hormonal Responses

*   **Oxytocin:** Known as the "bonding hormone," oxytocin is released during physical contact, such as cuddling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This hormone has calming effects on the nervous system, reduces the stress hormone response, and is inversely proportional to stress hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Physiologically, a hug makes individuals feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Oxytocin also plays a role in enabling feelings of love and forming loving bonds between people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Health Outcomes of Deprivation

Historically, studies on touch deprivation were conducted in orphanages, such as those in Romania, where individuals were physically starved for touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Today, the average person in society is experiencing touch deprivation, making such studies no longer confined to specific institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Touch deprivation is associated with:
*   Changes in cardiovascular outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Worsening of diabetes, indicated by changes in hemoglobin A1c levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Elevated cortisol levels and negative impacts on mental health parameters like depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Increased inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Impact on Pain Perception

Human touch significantly impacts the perception of pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. A study involving electrical shocks demonstrated that holding hands with a stranger, and especially with a loved one, blunted and attenuated the brain's perception and response to pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This indicates that human contact literally makes the experience of life less painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Societal Contributors to Touch Deprivation

Two primary factors contribute to the widespread [[impact_of_societal_norms_on_physical_touch | societal norms]] of touch deprivation:

1.  **Increased Emphasis on Independence:** Society has increasingly prioritized independence—financial, emotional, and otherwise—to the point where interdependence is often viewed as a weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This fosters a mindset where individuals shirk the responsibility of caring for others, outsourcing community needs to institutions or placing the burden solely on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Even practices like meditation, once communal, are now individualistic, often facilitated by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
2.  **Technological Substitution:** Technology aims to meet human needs without requiring direct human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This includes apps for meeting people, ordering food, or even ride-sharing options that allow passengers to request no conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The shift has led to a society where physical touch makes people uncomfortable, and digital substitutes, like sending emojis of people hugging, replace actual human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This trend extends to virtual girlfriends, human-shaped pillows, and sexual devices, creating artificial substitutes for human relationships that fail to genuinely fulfill human needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

This situation results from a collective unwillingness of individuals to provide what others need, stemming from a societal shift where personal pain to benefit another is avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. To address this, there needs to be a shift from blaming individuals or society to accepting personal responsibility for the needs of those around us, lowering the threshold for helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Coaching programs, particularly those focused on personal growth and goal achievement, benefit significantly from continuous feedback and iteration. This approach contrasts with traditional therapy models, which often lack structured mechanisms for learning from client outcomes.

## Challenges in Traditional Therapy Feedback

A significant issue in the field of therapy is the absence of robust feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. Therapists often find themselves ghosted by patients, meaning clients discontinue sessions without explanation, leaving the therapist unaware of the reasons for their departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. For instance, if a patient doesn't show up for an appointment, there's typically no formal follow-up to understand why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. This lack of feedback prevents therapists from learning from their mistakes and improving their practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. The prevailing attitude in some professional forums, like the psychotherapy subreddit, suggests that if a client reports more success with a coach after therapy, the therapist should simply congratulate themselves, implying the client didn't "understand the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

[[dr_ks_coaching_program_and_training_of_coaches | Dr. K's coaching program and training of coaches]] prioritizes a systematic feedback and iteration process to ensure its effectiveness. The program has undergone six curriculum revisions in two years, a testament to its commitment to improvement based on collected data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

### Mechanisms for Feedback

*   **Outcome Measurement:** The program measures outcomes and assesses coach performance, identifying which coaches are excelling and which need support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.
*   **Post-Session Feedback:** Clients provide feedback after sessions, offering direct insights into their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Community Feedback:** Direct feedback from the community, such as a Reddit post where a user reported their coach didn't know their name, triggers internal investigations to understand and address issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. This ensures accountability and allows for clarification of situations that might be misperceived.

### Benefits of Iteration

The collection and analysis of feedback allow the coaching program to continuously improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. This leads to positive outcomes for clients, as evidenced by good results in their data analysis and an upcoming published study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

The program's success is rooted in its ability to adapt and refine its methodology based on real-world experiences. For example, peer support services, as presented at the American Psychiatric Association, can improve depression and anxiety by helping individuals achieve life goals, such as finding a romantic partner, securing a job, or setting boundaries, rather than through direct clinical treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This demonstrates how non-clinical interventions, guided by effective coaching and continuous improvement, can lead to clinical benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

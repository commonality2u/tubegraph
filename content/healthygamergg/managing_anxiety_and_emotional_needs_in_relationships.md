Developing healthy relationships can be challenging, especially when past experiences contribute to present anxieties and behaviors like clinginess or emotional guardedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Understanding the root causes of these behaviors and learning to manage evolving [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | emotional needs]] are crucial steps toward fostering genuine connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## The Cycle of Clinginess and Driving People Away

Individuals may find themselves in a pattern where they form a healthy relationship, become overly clingy or invested, and then inadvertently push the other person away, sometimes leading to being "ghosted" or blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This often stems from a fear of abandonment, amplified by past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Origins in Childhood Trauma

A common underlying cause for guardedness and obsessive responses in relationships is a traumatic upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Experiences such as being bullied or consistently told by family that one was an "embarrassment," had the "wrong personality," or that "no one would like" them, can lead to deep-seated feelings of unworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These experiences can make relationships feel like "guessing games" where one always loses, fostering a tendency to become a loner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Such a past can program the brain to react with anxiety when partners pull away, even due to external life circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The ingrained fear that "people don't want to be my friend" or that one will "never exist in anyone's mind" becomes activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### The Problem of Self-Blame and Lack of Agency

When relationships sour, individuals often blame themselves, feeling they "ruined things" or "drove her away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. While friends may offer reassurance, this self-blame, if channeled constructively, can be a sign of readiness to take responsibility and make changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Taking responsibility for one's contribution to a relationship's outcome implies having the agency to change things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### The Evolution of Needs in a Relationship

Initially, relationships may feel easy and natural, with low emotional investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. However, when one partner becomes less available due to life circumstances (e.g., getting busy), the other may develop anxiety and clinginess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This anxiety often translates into a new [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | emotional need]] for reassurance from the partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

For example, sending long texts can be an unspoken plea for the other person to affirm one's existence and importance in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. When the other person, unaware of these underlying needs, reciprocates with shorter texts, the anxiety intensifies, leading to a vicious cycle of increased clinginess and withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This dynamic occurs because the anxious person is operating from their "own thinking" and not communicating their true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Steps Towards Healthy Relationships

### Acknowledge Your Contribution

While not entirely to blame, recognizing your contribution to a relationship's dynamic is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. If a pattern of people blocking or ghosting you recurs, there's a reason for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This doesn't mean you're a "bad person," but rather that your brain has been programmed in a way that creates these behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Understand and Process Emotions

The first step is to identify the emotions that arise when your partner pulls away and understand what fears trigger these reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. For example, the need for a partner to know "you exist" stems from a deep fear of non-existence in their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. By processing these underlying feelings and needs, the emotional energy driving clingy behaviors can be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

### Communication vs. Performance

Avoid trying to convey your complex internal state through excessive texting or other indirect means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Your partner cannot "keep up with all of the stuff that you're doing in your head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Instead, you need to:
*   **Process your internal "crap":** Address your anxieties so you can be on the same page with your partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Communicate directly:** If you feel overwhelmed, let your partner know where you are emotionally, giving them the opportunity to understand and meet you halfway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

### Letting Go and Accepting Circumstance

It can be hard to let go when a relationship ends, particularly if you assume the departure is solely "because of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. However, most partings occur for "a thousand reasons that have nothing to do with you," such as changing life circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. If someone chooses to leave, let them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. You deserve a relationship where someone genuinely wants to be with you and feels comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### Breaking the "Lonely Loop"

The inability to make friends can lead to becoming overly attached to any potential connection, placing "too much" emotional "luggage" on them from past disappointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. This often drives people away, reinforcing the cycle of loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. To break this loop, it's essential to "offload the luggage" by working through what it's like to be alone and processing past relationship experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

### Seeking Support

*   **Therapy or Coaching:** Working with a therapist or coach can help process past traumas and understand emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   **Group Coaching:** This provides a structured environment to practice forming relationships with clear boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. It offers an opportunity to learn [[healthy_communication_in_relationships | communication]] skills, vocalize feelings, connect with others, and understand oneself and others without the pressure of a one-on-one friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Group settings can help individuals learn to "unburden" themselves of emotional "luggage" rather than offloading it onto new relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

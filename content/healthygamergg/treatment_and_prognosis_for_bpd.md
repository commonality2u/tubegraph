[[understanding_borderline_personality_disorder_bpd | Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)]] is often considered one of the most misunderstood and stigmatized disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A common [[misconceptions_and_stigmatization_of_bpd | misconception]] is that BPD is a permanent condition, unlike illnesses such as anxiety which are seen as curable with treatment or medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. People often believe that personality disorders, being part of one's personality, are unchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. However, this is fortunately not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Prognosis for BPD

Despite common beliefs, BPD actually has one of the best prognoses among personality disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

*   **Remission Rates:** For patients hospitalized due to BPD:
    *   34% are in remission two years after hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
    *   49% are in remission four years after hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
    *   68% are in remission six years after hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
    *   86% are in remission a decade after hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   **Definition of Remission:** Remission means not having significant symptoms for a two-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Recurrence:** Only about 6% of people in remission experience recurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. The prognosis for BPD is genuinely positive, with very effective treatments available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

## Effective Treatment Approaches

There are very good treatments available for BPD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

*   **Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT):** This is a highly recommended treatment for BPD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. DBT combines cognitive behavioral therapy with a mindfulness component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
    *   Mindfulness helps individuals regulate emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
    *   It provides healthy alternative coping strategies to [[behavioral_patterns_and_emotional_experience_in_bpd | behaviors]] like substance use or cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
    *   Eastern yoga and meditation practices, incorporated into DBT, help individuals discover their sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Improvement

Several factors contribute to the improvement of BPD symptoms over time:

*   **Stable Relationships:** Having stable [[the_role_of_therapy_and_selfcare_in_relationships_involving_bpd | relationships]] can rapidly improve BPD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Even just one stable person in one's life can significantly improve things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. One study showed approximately a 50% remission rate at two years for individuals with a stable relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Brain Maturation:** As individuals age, their brain fully matures, particularly the frontal lobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Strong frontal lobe development helps mediate or reduce the [[core_features_of_bpd_and_their_impact_on_relationships | symptoms of BPD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. This means that simply aging can reduce symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
*   **Identity Development:** The [[core_features_of_bpd_and_their_impact_on_relationships | core issue]] in BPD is a distorted or unformed sense of self, leading to feelings of emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Individuals with BPD often define themselves based on how others treat them, requiring external validation to feel worthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. As individuals get older (e.g., from 21 to 31), they often develop a clearer sense of identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. This development of self, alongside supportive relationships, brain maturation, and engagement in treatment like DBT or mindfulness, can lead to significant improvement in BPD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

In conclusion, while [[understanding_borderline_personality_disorder_bpd | BPD]] can make relationships challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>, there is significant hope for recovery. With the right kind of treatment, and potentially even with age, many symptoms can resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. Individuals who suspect they have BPD are strongly encouraged to seek evaluation and treatment, and to not lose hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

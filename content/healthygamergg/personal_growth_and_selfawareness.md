Molena, a 21-year-old from Sweden, shares her experiences with navigating complex relationships and the challenges of [[personal_growth_and_selfacceptance | personal growth]] in a rapidly changing environment. Her journey highlights the interplay between her innate giving nature and the impact of external interactions on her [[identity_development_and_self_exploration | identity development and self-exploration]] and [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>.

## A Life of Adventure and Disillusionment
Molena describes her early life as driven by a deep desire for travel and adventure, particularly in New Zealand, where she felt she truly belonged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with her feelings about Sweden, where she never felt like she fit in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Her happiest times were spent traveling, engaging with "nice, very like open and like genuine and like happy and adventurous" people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

However, recent experiences, particularly over the last year, have left her feeling disappointed and scared of meeting new people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. She feels that many people have "turned out really dramatic or... become really mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, making it hard for her to trust others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This shift has made her question if she was "naive in the past" about how the world is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## The "Giver" Identity: Shakti
Molena identifies herself as a "giver" who likes to "make people happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This inherent desire to foster happiness stems from her childhood, where she felt a responsibility to take care of her mother, who was often depressed and dramatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. She effectively became her mother's "therapist" from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

This pattern of giving and putting others first is central to her identity. The concept of "Shakti" from Hindu tradition is introduced to describe Molena's energetic, maternal, and giving nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. People are drawn to her because she gives so freely, often taking advantage of her open and generous spirit in a world where energy is not freely given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:34">[01:30:34]</a>.

### Impact on Relationships
Molena's giving nature extends to her open relationship with her fiancé, Destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. She values the ability to allow him to "experience multiple things in life and not just me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, finding happiness in his ability to share his love with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

However, this openness has often led to painful experiences where other partners become jealous, mean, or try to sabotage her relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. She feels "used somehow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, as the relationships often become "lopsided" or one-sided, where she gives but does not receive in kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. An analogy of a child taking a bite of eggs but refusing to share theirs highlights Molena's feeling of unfairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

Molena struggles with the concept of jealousy, believing that people "don't have to start drama" because they can "get out of it" what they want without being mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. She perceives their actions as intentionally trying to make her feel bad or jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of [[role_of_selfacceptance_and_selfcriticism_in_personal_growth | Self-Acceptance]] and "Selfishness"
The conversation reveals Molena's deep-seated aversion to the idea of being "selfish," a concept she associates with negative connotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>. This stems from her upbringing where she had to prioritize others' happiness, leading to the suppression of her own negative feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>.

Her willingness to endure pain in her open relationship for the sake of Destiny's happiness further illustrates this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. She feels she can't easily put herself first because she has "never done that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. The therapist challenges this notion, suggesting that Molena's focus on others' happiness often removes her from her own picture, leaving her feeling "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## [[building_selfawareness_for_personal_growth | Building Self-awareness for Personal Growth]]
The conversation guides Molena towards greater [[building_selfawareness_for_personal_growth | self-awareness for personal growth]] by exploring the difficult concept of being "selfish" in a healthy way.

### Redefining Monogamy and Control
Molena initially believes that a monogamous relationship involves "controlling your partner's feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. The therapist redefines monogamy as a "choice" to restrain actions, not feelings, for the sake of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>. This highlights Molena's perception of control and her reluctance to impose limits, even for her own well-being.

### The Rama and Krishna Analogy
A key analogy from Hinduism is used to illustrate different approaches to life:
*   **Rama:** Represents the "ideal human being"—noble, kind, honest, and giving, prioritizing the needs of the kingdom over his own marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Krishna:** Represents a more pragmatic approach, willing to bend rules if the "ends justify the means," prioritizing his objectives without necessarily adhering to strict codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

Molena is identified as more like Rama, inclined to put others first and suffer for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. The therapist suggests that living like Rama can lead to a "good life" but living like Krishna can lead to a "happy life," implying that Molena may need to cultivate a degree of "selfishness" (like Krishna) to protect herself from being "drained dry" by hungry people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

### Setting Boundaries and Self-Care
Molena is encouraged to consider setting boundaries in her relationships, including her streaming activities and open relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>. This means viewing interactions as transactions where she gives and receives, and deciding if the "drama" and hurt are "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>.

A crucial piece of advice is to communicate her feelings and pain to Destiny, even if it might make him unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. This is framed not as control, but as sharing her feelings in a marriage where both partners should prioritize each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. This also ties into [[courage_and_selfreflection | courage and self-reflection]], as it requires confronting difficult emotions and potential discomfort.

## [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | Self-awareness and Mental Health]] Through Meditation
To facilitate [[building_selfawareness_for_personal_growth | building self-awareness for personal growth]] and manage the "intensity" she feels, Molena is guided through a meditation exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>. This practice helps her to:
*   **Recognize inner sensations:** She identifies her chest as the place where she feels both love and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>.
*   **Identify the negative aspect of giving:** She acknowledges that with love, comes a negative feeling of "not being in the picture" and feeling "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:53">[01:35:53]</a>. This resonates with her childhood sadness, viewing her younger self with sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>.
*   **Integrate conflicting feelings:** The meditation encourages her to let the feelings of caring for others and self-neglect coexist, rather than pushing the latter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.
*   **Redirect self-love:** She is asked to turn her unconditional love, which always goes out to others, back towards herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>.

This [[courage_and_selfreflection | self-reflection]] helps Molena realize that she "never heard someone tell me this, tell you what that I seem to put myself away from link because of other people did I want to make them happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>. This new [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | self-awareness]] is a crucial step for her [[role_of_selfacceptance_and_selfcriticism_in_personal_growth | role of self-acceptance and self-criticism in personal growth]] and for overcoming future challenges.

## Conclusion: Balancing Giving and Self-Care
Molena's journey underscores that while a giving nature is a beautiful trait, it can lead to [[selflove_and_overcoming_challenges | challenges]] and pain if not balanced with [[selflove_and_overcoming_challenges | self-love]] and boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. The pursuit of [[personal_growth_and_selfacceptance | personal growth]] for Molena involves recognizing the need to prioritize her own well-being, even if it feels "selfish," and to communicate her needs to her partner. This shift is essential for her [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | mental health]] and overall happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:16">[01:44:16]</a>.

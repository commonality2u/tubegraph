Sometimes, when an individual achieves something, the expected feeling of accomplishment is replaced by a sense of relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This can be observed in situations like completing a final exam; instead of exclaiming "yay, I did it," the common reaction is "oh my god, thank god that's over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

If a person's life is structured in a way where their actual accomplishments consistently evoke only relief instead of achievement, it can become challenging to maintain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This phenomenon highlights a disconnect between the effort invested and the rewarding emotional outcome typically associated with success.

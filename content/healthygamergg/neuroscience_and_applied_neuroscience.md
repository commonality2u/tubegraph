Neuroscience is a field that studies the nervous system, including the brain, and how it functions [03:58:00]. Applied neuroscience, as described by a psychiatrist, focuses on how this knowledge can be used in practical situations [03:56:00]. This can range from understanding the effects of brain damage due to a car accident and how to work with it [04:04:00] to comprehending how the brain changes under prolonged periods of stress [04:20:00].

## The Brain Under Stress
When an individual experiences stress, the body releases several hormones [04:32:00].
*   **Adrenaline (Epinephrine):** These are fast-acting hormones that affect the brain in specific ways [04:40:00]. One notable effect of adrenaline is that it narrows peripheral vision from approximately 180 degrees to 30 degrees [04:50:00]. This is an evolutionary adaptation designed to help individuals focus on immediate threats [04:54:00]. Psychologically, stress can also cause a similar "tunnel vision," making it difficult to consider anything beyond what is directly in front of them [05:06:00]. Adrenaline also increases the speed of thoughts, makes thoughts appear black and white, and causes possibilities to feel like realities [03:00:32]. This is an evolutionary mechanism, as perceiving danger as a reality increases the likelihood of survival [03:00:52].
*   **Cortisol:** This hormone has a slower onset, kicking in within an hour and lasting for 4 to 24 hours [05:22:00]. Cortisol affects the reticular activating formation, a part of the brain that governs sleep [05:40:00]. This effect is also evolutionary, designed to make sleep easily disturbed in dangerous situations, allowing for quick waking if a threat is perceived [05:51:00]. In modern times, prolonged mental stress, such as worrying about paying rent, can lead to difficulty sleeping because the reticular activating formation remains highly active [06:33:00].

The body's physiological response to stress doesn't differentiate between a physical threat (like a tiger) and mental stress (like financial worries) [06:23:00]. The body simply uses its available mechanisms [06:31:00].

## Brain Function and Certainty
The human brain is designed to create certainty out of uncertainty [02:50:00]. In situations with little information, the brain provides answers to complex problems, even if illogical, to enable action [02:50:00]. This mechanism explains how most people function through life, making assumptions to navigate an uncertain world [02:49:00]. For instance, a person assumes their workplace will be there when they drive to work, even though they don't know for certain [02:53:00].

This brain function is also evident in [[consumer_neuroscience_and_technology_use | consumer neuroscience]] [02:42:30]. Studies show that people often fabricate logical reasons for illogical behavior [02:44:00]. For example, if cookies are placed prominently at a checkout, a shopper might buy them and then provide a rationalization like "Mike really likes these cookies," even though the primary reason was the strategic placement [02:47:00]. The mind is designed to work backward from a conclusion, fabricating reasons for actions [02:50:00].

### The Minds' Components
The mind can be understood as having different parts [01:12:40]:
*   **Manas (Emotional Mind):** This part of the mind likes or dislikes and reacts instantly [01:12:43]. It is guttural and visceral [01:15:49], with reactions occurring in less than a second [01:14:04]. For example, the immediate liking or disliking of a new food, or an emotional reaction to a bully, happens almost instantaneously [01:14:04].
*   **Buddhi (Analytical Mind/Intellect):** This is the rational, analytical part of the mind [01:16:01]. It engages in processing and thinking through situations [01:24:25]. Unlike the Manas, the Buddhi is not well-developed in early childhood but grows and changes over time [01:16:26].

A "war" often occurs between these two parts, such as the Manas reacting negatively to seafood, while the Buddhi encourages trying new experiences [01:16:07].

### Sanskaras: Undigested Emotion
When strong emotional reactions occur, particularly at a young age, and are not fully processed or understood, they can be stored in the unconscious mind as "Sanskaras" [02:10:00]. A Samskara is described as a "ball of undigested emotion" [02:11:00].

For a child, if an experience like being nipped by a dog leads to fear, and that fear is then distracted away (e.g., with ice cream) rather than processed, the fear goes dormant as a Samskara [02:15:00]. It will then re-emerge the next time a similar trigger is encountered [02:19:00].

In adults, when a fearful event occurs, the Manas reacts with immediate fear, but the Buddhi then steps in to process the situation [02:22:00]. This processing allows the individual to understand the event, and as a result, the subsequent fear response is less intense, and the Samskara is smaller [02:24:00]. If emotions are treated with distraction instead of processing, the Samskara remains dormant and can resurface with triggers [02:26:00].

## Addressing Existential Dread
Existential dread can be understood as a large Samskara [03:52:00]. When one experiences this dread, it can be beneficial to use the Buddhi to analyze it [03:59:00].

One of the theories about the origin of existential dread, especially the worry about not being able to take care of oneself, stems from an assumption that others will not be present or reliable [03:57:00]. This belief is often primitive, formed at a very young age, and therefore deeply ingrained and illogical [03:58:00]. When ideas are formed in the mind at a young age, they tend to retain the immaturity of their origin [03:58:00]. A young child might feel they cannot count on themselves or others, and this deep-seated belief can persist into adulthood, even when logic suggests otherwise [03:59:00].

This feeling of isolation and self-reliance can be reinforced by experiences where one's deep concerns or needs are not understood or taken seriously by those who are supposed to offer support, such as parents or counselors [04:54:00]. This can lead to a perception that the world is a scary place where one cannot count on others [04:06:00]. For individuals who are highly intelligent or think differently, they may have "special needs" for understanding and validation that, if unmet, can be harmful [04:09:00].

### Strategies for Addressing Existential Dread
To work through existential dread, one can:
1.  **Analyze with Buddhi:** Consciously analyze the feeling using the rational mind [03:59:00].
2.  **Re-experience and Shepherd:** Sit with the feeling and re-experience it, acting as a "shepherd" to your younger self [04:06:00]. This involves an adult perspective reassuring the younger self who felt alone and had to rely solely on themselves [04:14:00].
3.  **Process Past Experiences:** Think back to times in life when one felt alone or that they could only rely on themselves [04:54:00]. This helps to process the old, undigested emotions that form the Samskara [03:22:00].
4.  **Consider Therapy:** [[application_of_scientific_knowledge_to_individual_lives | Therapy]] and other mental health professional support can also help in processing these emotions [04:21:00]. The model of Manas and Buddhi can help understand how therapy aids in processing [04:30:00].

### Cultivating Presence
Meditation and physical practices like yoga can help bring the mind to the present, which counteracts anxiety (which is always future-focused) [03:37:00]. While some meditations focus on emptying thoughts to achieve presence [03:43:29], other methods use physical sensations to anchor the mind to the now [01:48:00].

*   **Balance Exercises:** Engaging in challenging physical balance exercises, such as standing on one foot with eyes closed, forces the mind to focus on the present sensation of balancing [01:47:00]. It becomes difficult to think about the past or future when intensely focused on maintaining balance [01:47:00]. Balance relies on the vestibular system (ears), vision, and proprioception (sensation of position in space) [01:48:00]. Closing the eyes makes it harder, requiring more focus [01:48:50].
*   **Yoga:** Yoga postures are designed to bring the mind to the present [01:49:00]. The goal is not just physical stretching but finding a stable position that demands such focus that the mind cannot wander [01:49:17].
*   **Physical Endurance:** Holding challenging physical positions, like arms outstretched, can also force presence as fatigue demands attention, making it hard for the mind to wander [01:50:11].

These physical practices can be a way to use the body to force the mind into the present moment, rather than solely relying on mental emptying techniques [01:49:51].

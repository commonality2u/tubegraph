Tiredness is frequently identified as the number one emotion people report feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While often perceived as a physiological state, such as a lack of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, it also has significant mental and emotional dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article explores [[the_mental_and_physical_aspects_of_tiredness | the mental and physical aspects of tiredness]] and [[physiological_causes_of_tiredness_and_energy_management | strategies for managing it]], particularly focusing on its emotional nature.

## Tiredness as an Emotion

Tiredness can manifest suddenly, such as feeling exhausted at the mere sight of a parent's phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> or a boss's email on a Friday afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This quick onset suggests that tiredness is not always purely a lack of physical energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Despite engaging in physical strategies like taking supplements or dietary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, individuals may still feel tired, indicating an underlying emotional component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

In this context, emotions are understood as information from the body and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, not simply "good" or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Just as fear signals worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a> or anger helps set boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, tiredness serves a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### The Brain's Energy Conservation Strategy

Tiredness is an adaptive mechanism of the brain, designed to help avoid "useless work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. It's the brain's response to the perception of a high workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, especially for tasks with unclear chances of success or progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. For example, tasks like paying taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> or writing a dissertation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a> can feel insurmountable, leading the brain to induce tiredness as a protective measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

This ancient mechanism helps prevent wasting energy on efforts with low probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>, effectively telling us "don't bother, don't try, stop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. It's a [[tips_on_conserving_motivational_energy | strategy for energy conservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a> and shaping behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Overcome Feelings of Tiredness

To overcome tiredness, particularly when it's emotionally or mentally induced, the key is to understand its underlying message and challenge the brain's protective calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### 1. Identify the Trigger Scenario

Start by noticing the specific scenario in which tiredness appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Is it a phone call, an email, or the thought of a difficult task? Ask yourself: "What about this is exhausting?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a> This helps differentiate between physiological exhaustion and the brain's protective mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

### 2. Question the "Waste of Energy" Perception

Your brain's signal of tiredness often stems from a feeling that an activity is a "waste of energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluate the actual outcome**: Ask yourself, "If I were to do this, how would I feel afterward?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>
*   **Challenge negative predictions**: Your mind might tell you that even after doing some work (e.g., two hours on taxes, one chapter of a dissertation), you'll still feel terrible because so much is left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. Recognize this as a disincentive to making progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.
*   **Reframe the outcome**: For many tasks, such as exercising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, completing a portion actually makes you feel good because you've made progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.

### 3. Chunk Large Tasks into Smaller Pieces

[[strategies_for_improving_productivity_and_emotional_health | Productivity techniques]] that involve breaking down large, abstract tasks into smaller, manageable chunks are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. For instance, instead of focusing on "100 chapters," aim for "one chapter today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. When a small target is completed, it signals to your brain that the effort was not a waste of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>, which can reduce feelings of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.

### 4. Understand Emotional Drain in Relationships

In social contexts, like visiting family for the holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>, tiredness can signal that you perceive an interaction as emotionally draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. If you feel that someone is relying on you to fulfill their emotional needs beyond your capacity, leading to you feeling "sucked dry" and "drained," this can be a source of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. Recognizing this helps you understand why these interactions feel exhausting, even if you don't physically exert yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.

By asking yourself "what about this makes me feel tired?" and "if I were to do this, how would I feel afterward?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a> you can uncover the core reasons for your tiredness and begin to address them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.

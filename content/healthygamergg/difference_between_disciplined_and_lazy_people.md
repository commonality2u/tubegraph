The world can be broadly categorized into two groups of people: those who are [[understanding_discipline_as_an_emotion | disciplined]] and those who are [[perceptions_and_misconceptions_of_laziness | lazy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Characteristics of Disciplined People
[[understanding_discipline_as_an_emotion | Disciplined]] individuals are often characterized by their significant willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. When they commit to something, they tend to focus on it and stick with it consistently, day after day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Examples of this include exercising daily or consistently eating healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Their ability to follow through is a defining trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Characteristics of Lazy People
In contrast, those described as [[perceptions_and_misconceptions_of_laziness | lazy]] often start new endeavors with great enthusiasm, but this excitement tends to wane over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. They might invest in equipment or classes for a new hobby, like a guitar or yoga, but eventually, they get bored of the activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Initially, they might attempt to use willpower to overcome this boredom, leading to an internal "war with their mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While they might win this battle on some days, the capacity to force themselves to continue declines over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Ultimately, these abandoned activities join a "graveyard of other things" they were once excited about but no longer pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## The Core Problem: Misunderstanding the Mind
The fundamental issue preventing consistent follow-through is a lack of understanding about how the mind operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Often, people try to overcome their mind's natural inclinations using willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Willpower, in this context, is defined as forcing the mind to do something it doesn't want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Instead of fighting the mind, a more effective approach involves learning its natural tendencies and using them to facilitate follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Natural Tendencies of the Mind
Two key tendencies of the mind are crucial for understanding follow-through:
1.  **Curiosity:** The mind is inherently curious and enjoys engaging with novel stimuli and new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This engagement can lead to a dopamine release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
2.  **Tolerance/Boredom:** The mind develops a tolerance to any consistent stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This is evident in sensory experiences, like getting used to the feel of a shirt or a bad smell, and also applies to pleasurable activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The initial enjoyment of a piece of cake, pizza, or a video game declines with continued exposure until boredom sets in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

The problem with following through arises when the mind develops tolerance to the current activity and then begins to crave a different activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The difficulty in staying on task is not the task itself, but the mind's desire for something elseâ€”like watching TV, checking social media, or playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. These desires are essentially cravings for dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Urge Surfing: A Solution for Follow-Through
Instead of fighting the mind's tendencies, the technique of "urge surfing" utilizes the mind's natural tendency to get bored to aid follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Urge surfing is an evidence-based technique used in addiction psychiatry to help individuals withstand cravings for substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The general principle is that urges or cravings arise, but if one can tolerate them for a period, "surfing on top of the urge" instead of giving in, the urge will eventually diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The mind develops tolerance even to its own cravings; if you don't give in, it will eventually get bored of the craving and shift focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Cravings, even intense ones, do not last forever, similar to other emotions like joy or heartbreak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### How to Practice Urge Surfing
1.  **Notice the Desire to Switch:** Recognize that the desire to switch tasks or activities is a craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
2.  **Surf on Top:** Notice the urge arise within you, the desire for your mind to do something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
3.  **Resist Giving In:** Your mind may try to trick you with dialogue like "this is boring," "it's a waste of time," or "we'll do it tomorrow," but underneath is just a craving for dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The goal is simply to notice the craving and not give in to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
4.  **Allow the Mind to Return:** Paradoxically, by tolerating the craving, the mind will eventually get bored of wanting something else and naturally return to the desired task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges and Mind's Resistance
When attempting urge surfing, the mind may resist by presenting arguments such as "my cravings are too powerful" or focusing on scenarios where the technique might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. It's important to recognize this as the mind's attempt to avoid engaging with a technique that works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

It's not necessary to start with the strongest cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Urge surfing is a skill that develops over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Even if some cravings seem too difficult, focus on the 25% that can be handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Often, individuals have already unknowingly practiced urge surfing, such as when watching a video and resisting the urge to switch off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The craving arises, and then it melts away, demonstrating the principle of urge surfing in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The key is to apply this already existing ability to other aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

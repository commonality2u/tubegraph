The struggle to balance reaching out to others with the tendency to ghost them stems from a core problem rooted in one's self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Individuals grappling with this issue often feel they have "no personality," are "hollow," or are "too boring" to offer value to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This deep-seated belief leads to a fear of interacting with people, both online and in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## The Cycle of Courage and Ghosting

The mind struggling with this issue operates in a specific pattern:
1.  **Core Beliefs**: The cycle begins with foundational beliefs such as "I am too boring," and "I am not valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Momentary [[courage_and_selfreflection | Courage]]**: Despite these beliefs, individuals sometimes muster up [[courage_and_selfreflection | courage]] to message people or respond to their messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, effectively reaching out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
3.  **The Fear of Exposure**: The underlying fear is that if a conversation develops, others will realize they are "boring" or "uninteresting," leading to them ceasing communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This internal conflict manifests as a fear of [[overcoming_fear_of_rejection | rejection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
4.  **Ghosting as a Defense**: To avoid this perceived rejection, the individual often ends up ghosting people for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This behavior is driven by a desire to prevent others from realizing the perceived lack of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, operating as a form of [[overcoming_self_sabotage | self-sabotage]].
5.  **Reinforcement of Negative Beliefs**: Once ghosting occurs, feelings of guilt and self-criticism ("I'm so pathetic") arise, which further reinforce the core belief of being invaluable or inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. This cycle strengthens the initial negative self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
6.  **Rationalizations**: The mind then develops rationalizations to avoid future attempts at reaching out. These include thoughts like "I can only put on a mask for so long" or "Don't bother, it's a waste of time, no point in trying to hang out if they are going to find out eventually" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. These are defense mechanisms designed to protect against perceived rejection and the ensuing negative feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. The mind concludes that reaching out simply makes one feel bad, thus advising against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

### The Role of Willpower

Initially, willpower can be used to overcome these thoughts and bolster [[courage_and_selfreflection | courage]] to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. However, willpower is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, and eventually, the tendency to ghost overrides it, perpetuating the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Addressing the Root Cause

To break this cycle, it's crucial to address the core belief of not being valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This means questioning where the belief that "all other people are better than you" or that "you're not on their level" originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

When this core belief (or "sumscar" â€“ a deep-seated impression or trauma) is identified and dismantled, the other related issues, such as ghosting and rationalizations, will naturally "crumble down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

While working on symptoms (like ghosting) can be valuable, addressing the root cause provides more profound and lasting relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. This approach allows for both symptomatic relief and root cause relief simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. The process of uncovering and working through these deep-seated beliefs can lead to significant emotional breakthroughs, especially when the individual has already engaged in extensive self-improvement work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>, making the root cause "right under the surface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

The pervasive presence of technology in modern culture, particularly the internet, has led to a significant [[impact_of_technology_and_external_stimuli | inundation of external stimuli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This phenomenon raises questions about its effects on the human mind and mental health, especially concerning topics like sexuality and human intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While the full scope of these effects is still unknown, it is suspected that they are not entirely beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## How Technology Exploits Brain Evolution

Content that thrives on the internet often takes advantage of the evolutionary architecture of our brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Our brains have evolved to be attracted to specific things that once provided survival benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Analogy to Food Industry
A parallel can be drawn with the food industry: humans are naturally attracted to high-calorie density foods because this preference was a survival advantage in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Today, industries have adapted to this inherent preference, leading to widespread consumption of unhealthy foods like sugary, fatty, and delicious options, contributing to health issues like diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Similarly, current industries are adapting to the brain's existing architecture, particularly concerning dopamine and sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Adaptation by Content Creators
Just as the food industry has adapted to our biological preferences, the technology and content industries are doing the same for cognitive and behavioral patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This involves understanding how the brain is wired to create the most "pull" or engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. For example, Instagram models intuitively learn what type of content (e.g., certain levels of revealing attire) garners the most engagement, effectively "figuring out" brain wiring through trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_technological_advancements_on_pornography_consumption | Impact of Technological Advancements on Pornography Consumption]] and Intimacy

The inundation of sexual stimuli, including sexually explicit and implicit content (like Twitch's "hot tub meta"), is widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Pornography Addiction and Expectations
One observable psychiatric consequence is pornography addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. The likelihood of addiction is correlated with earlier exposure and higher intensity of pornography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This exposure can also lead to confusion around intimacy and unrealistic expectations about sexual experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. For instance, individuals may develop misperceptions about normal bodily functions, such as the quantity of ejaculate during an orgasm, due to exaggerated portrayals in pornography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. The brain can rewire to expect a certain kind of stimulus, leading to difficulties with more typical stimuli, sometimes referred to as "death grip syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### The Rise of OnlyFans and Parasocial Relationships
The rapid evolution of sexual content platforms, such as OnlyFans, makes studying their long-term effects challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. The parasocial element of OnlyFans, where users can feel a sense of connection or interaction with content creators, is likely to exacerbate intimacy issues in real relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. While traditional pornography (like magazines) offered zero interaction, newer platforms offer increasing levels of engagement, preying on the brain's desire for interaction and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This [[role_of_technology_in_substituting_human_interaction | substitution of human interaction]] can create complex emotional dynamics for partners in real-world relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

## Broader Societal and Cognitive "Climate Change"

Technology is evolving so rapidly that research cannot keep pace with its effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. We are witnessing a "cognitive revolution" or a "cognitive climate change" where many technological advancements offer short-term cognitive benefits but contribute to long-term challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. This is seen in the increasing rates of mental illness, depression, anxiety, and suicide, which are possibly signs of this broader cognitive shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

While technologies like pornography, OnlyFans, YouTube, and Twitch may contribute to these issues, it is not necessarily an argument to halt technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. Instead, it presents new challenges for humanity to learn about itself and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

## Future Concerns and Predictions

### VR, Haptic Feedback, and AI
A significant concern for the future is the development of virtual reality (VR) with haptic feedback, especially when combined with artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. This could potentially lead to scenarios where individuals prefer fully virtual companions, such as an "AI waifu" with haptic feedback, to the extent that it might reduce or eliminate human reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

## Navigating the Changes
The "waifu revolution," where virtual partners become increasingly realistic and appealing, may follow a similar trajectory to how video gaming moved from a niche hobby to a mainstream activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. As technology improves, what was once considered "less than human" or subject to mockery may become widely accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, it is possible to build healthier relationships and navigate these changes by learning more about ourselves and fostering better communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

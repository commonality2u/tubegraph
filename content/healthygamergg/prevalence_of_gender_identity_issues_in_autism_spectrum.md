A recent meta-analysis has shed light on a significant [[link_between_autism_and_gender_identity | strong link]] between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and gender identity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This paper synthesizes a growing body of research, as interest in both ASD and gender identity issues has increased exponentially over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, with the number of studies on these topics more than doubling in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Key Findings from the Meta-Analysis

This [[metaanalysis on autism and gender identity | meta-analysis]] pooled data from 41 different studies investigating the connection between ASD and gender identity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The findings indicate a remarkably high correlation:

*   **Overall Likelihood**: Individuals with ASD are 11 times more likely to have gender identity issues compared to the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **General Population**: When parents report high autistic traits in their children, they also report increased gender variance in those children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Autism Population**:
    *   People with ASD are four times (400%) more likely to endorse gender dysphoria or [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   A staggering 15% of individuals with ASD report being non-binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Reverse Relationship (Likelihood of ASD in people with Gender Identity Issues)**:
    *   Among children with reported [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]], 3% to 21% have a high degree of ASD or autistic traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   For adults with [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]], approximately 4.8% to 7.8% either have ASD or test highly for autistic traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   The difference in percentages between children and adults suggests a neurodevelopmental link, indicating that the numbers can change as individuals grow and develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## Correlation vs. Causation

The study highlights that while a strong correlation exists, it does not clarify causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. It is currently unclear whether being autistic makes one more likely to have [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity variance]], or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Significance and [[clinical_implications_of_comorbidity_between_autism_and_gender_identity | Clinical Implications]]

This research is significant for several reasons:

*   **Neurodevelopmental Perspective**: Both ASD and [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity]] are neurodevelopmental processes that unfold over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The brains of individuals with ASD have different neurodevelopmental trajectories, which could explain how these two conditions interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Genetics and Epigenetics**: The findings encourage further investigation into potential genetic or epigenetic links, such as whether a single gene contributes to both, or if ASD affects gene activation in ways that influence gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Epigenetics refers to the turning on or off of genes, where experiences (like trauma) can activate or deactivate genes, leading to different outcomes even with the same genetic makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **[[mentalization_challenges_in_autism_and_gender_identity | Mentalization Challenges]]**: One theory posits that individuals with ASD often have difficulty with mentalizing, which is the capacity to understand mental statesâ€”both their own and others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   Mentalizing allows individuals to understand the intentions behind actions (e.g., a birthday present means someone cares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
    *   Individuals with ASD may struggle with internal mentalizing, making it difficult to understand their internal environment and how it shapes their actions or feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   Since [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity]] is largely internally determined, difficulties in internal mentalizing could explain why individuals with ASD might struggle to understand their own gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   This suggests that [[mentalization_challenges_in_autism_and_gender_identity | mentalization training]] could be a valuable intervention for individuals with ASD and [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity variants]], helping them clarify their gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Applicability for Patients**: If you are struggling with [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]], considering an evaluation for autism traits may be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Conversely, if you have been diagnosed with ASD, exploring [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]] could be important, as confusion around gender identity might contribute to difficulties in forming relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Applicability for Clinicians**: Given the high rates of comorbidity, clinicians working with patients who have ASD should consider evaluating them for [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Similarly, those working with patients experiencing [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]] should consider evaluating for autism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Addressing both conditions is crucial, as they independently increase the risk of mental distress, and their combination may have a multiplicative effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Understanding "Comorbidity"

The term "comorbidity" uses the word "morbid," which has roots in the assumption of illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. In the medical field, and society at large, there's an ongoing discussion about what constitutes a "disorder" versus an acceptable "normal variant" of human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Definition of Disorder
> Generally, a disorder is defined by an impairment of function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. For example, severe ASD that impacts activities of daily living (ADLs) to the point of needing assistance would be classified as a disorder due to the functional impairment, without placing a value judgment on the individual's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

## The Meta-Analysis Paper

The paper discussed is titled: "Autism spectrum disorder and gender dysphoria/incongruence: a systematic literature review" and was published in March 2022. The primary author is Khalid Sunaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

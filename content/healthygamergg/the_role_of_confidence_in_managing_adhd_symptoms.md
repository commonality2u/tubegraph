Individuals with [[strategies_for_managing_adhd_symptoms | ADHD]] often conflate attentional problems with a lack of intelligence, leading to feelings of stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This perception can significantly impact their confidence, which in turn influences the manifestation and management of their ADHD symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

## Confidence and ADHD Behaviors

A lack of confidence can lead individuals with ADHD to lean into behaviors that provide a sense of validation or protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. For example, some may resort to constantly making jokes to elicit euphoric feelings and approval from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. This "ADHD process" of seeking external validation through humor can, paradoxically, reinforce and strengthen the very ADHD characteristics one wishes to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. It acts as a protective mechanism against feeling dumb or inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.

The environment can also play a role in this cycle. High-stimulus environments, such as grocery stores with many distractions like colors, sounds, and people talking, can amplify ADHD symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:43">[02:48:43]</a>. In such settings, an individual might find it harder to focus and feel less competent, leading to a greater reliance on coping mechanisms like humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## The Impact of Low Confidence

Feeling unintelligent or lacking confidence leads to a cycle where the "fuel" for the ADHD "gas tank" increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. This means that behaviors driven by ADHD become more pronounced and habitual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. Individuals may feel they are "getting dumber" or that their ADHD is "getting worse" because they are inadvertently feeding these patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.

Social media and streaming environments, with their constant influx of information and demands for attention across multiple monitors and chats, can also contribute to this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. These platforms train the brain to shift attention rapidly, which can exacerbate ADHD symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>. The tendency to focus on negative comments (e.g., the 25% wrong on a test) rather than positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a> further erodes confidence. This confirmation bias strengthens existing negative self-beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

## Cultivating Confidence to Manage ADHD

Building confidence is a crucial step in managing ADHD symptoms because it reduces the underlying need for the ADHD-driven protective behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. This involves:

*   **Accepting Vulnerabilities**: Acknowledging and accepting areas where one struggles, even if it feels "dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:07">[03:19:07]</a>. For example, communicating honestly with others about attentional limitations in certain environments can be difficult but ultimately leads to understanding and improved interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:23">[03:39:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   **Challenging Negative Self-Perception**: Recognizing that perceived "stupidity" is often a misinterpretation of attentional problems rather than a lack of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Individuals with ADHD can often process new concepts rapidly and are highly adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Difference Between Ego and Confidence**: True confidence comes from within, while ego is often a defense mechanism against insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Reducing reliance on ego-driven behaviors (like constant joking to seek validation) allows for genuine confidence to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.
*   **Mindfulness and Attention Training**: Practicing [[strategies_for_managing_adhd_symptoms | strategies for managing ADHD symptoms]] such as meditation, writing, or focusing on a single sensory input (like a keyboard) can slow down the mind and improve attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:30">[02:35:30]</a>. Consistent practice strengthens concentration skills, making individuals feel more capable and, consequently, more confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

By addressing the root causes of low confidence and actively training attention, individuals can reduce the need to fuel ADHD-driven behaviors, leading to a more present and fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:57">[03:30:57]</a>.

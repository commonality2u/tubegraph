Many people struggle with "following through" on their goals, often finding themselves initially excited but eventually losing interest [00:00:31]. This struggle leads to projects and hobbies being abandoned, joining a "graveyard of other things" that were once exciting [00:02:10]. The common approach to this issue is to use willpower to force oneself to continue, engaging in a "war with our mind" that is often lost over time [00:01:04].

The key problem is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the mind works [00:02:24]. Instead of fighting against the mind's natural tendencies, the [[understanding_the_minds_cravings_and_boredom | urge surfing technique]] leverages them to achieve lasting behavioral change [00:02:41].

## The Mind's Natural Tendencies

To understand [[understanding_the_minds_cravings_and_boredom | how the mind works]] in relation to following through, two primary tendencies are crucial:

1.  **Curiosity and Excitement for New Things**
    The mind is inherently curious and enjoys engaging with novel stimuli, whether it's a new TV show, learning an instrument, or starting a new hobby [00:03:10]. This engagement often leads to a "dopamine release" [00:03:24].
2.  **Development of Tolerance to Stimuli**
    The mind develops a tolerance to any kind of stimuli over time [00:03:29]. This is evident in simple experiences, like no longer feeling your shirt after putting it on [00:03:35], or a bad smell in a restroom becoming tolerable after a few seconds [00:03:43]. This tolerance also applies to dopaminergic experiences; the enjoyment from the first bite of cake or pizza declines with subsequent bites [00:03:52]. Similarly, activities like video games can become unenjoyable after prolonged engagement, leading to a desire to switch to something new [00:04:08].

The challenge with following through arises when the mind becomes bored with the current activity and craves something different [00:04:20].

## What is Urge Surfing?

[[strategies_for_overcoming_pornography_addiction | Urge surfing]] is an [[evidence_based_techniques_to_boost_self_control | evidence-based technique]] used in addiction psychiatry to help individuals withstand intense cravings [00:04:38]. It has been successfully applied to help people addicted to substances like alcohol, heroin, and cocaine [00:04:55].

The general principle is that cravings or urges arise, but if tolerated for a period, they will naturally subside [00:05:07]. The mind, which develops tolerance to stimuli, will also eventually get bored of the urge or craving itself if it is not given in to [00:05:21]. For example, if you crave pizza but cannot obtain it on an airplane, the craving will eventually diminish over the course of the flight [00:05:33].

### Urges and Following Through

When struggling to follow through on a task, the challenge isn't that the task itself is difficult, but rather that the mind desires something else [00:06:46]. This desire to switch to a different activity—whether it's watching TV, checking social media, looking at memes, texting friends, playing video games, or even watching [[understanding_pornography_addiction | pornography]]—is a craving in and of itself [00:07:03]. Therefore, difficulty with following through is fundamentally connected to managing these cravings for other activities [00:07:21].

## How to Urge Surf

To effectively follow through by using [[strategies for overcoming pornography addiction | urge surfing]], paradoxically, the goal is not to overcome the mind's tendency to be bored, but to use it to your advantage [00:04:29].

The process involves:
1.  **Notice the Desire**: Recognize when your mind wants to switch tasks or desires something else [00:06:18]. This feeling will manifest as a craving [00:07:31].
2.  **Tolerate the Craving**: Instead of giving in, "surf on top of it" [00:07:34]. Notice the urge arise without acting on it [00:08:04]. Your mind may try to trick you with thoughts like "this is boring," "it's a waste of time," or "we'll do it tomorrow," but these are just dialogue masking the underlying craving for dopamine [00:07:46].
3.  **Allow the Craving to Pass**: Understand that no cravings, like any feelings, last forever [00:08:26]. Just as joy or heartbreak eventually fade, so too will the intensity of a craving [00:08:30]. By tolerating the urge, the mind will eventually get bored of wanting something, and will naturally return to the task you intend to do [00:08:47].

This technique leverages the mind's natural tendency to habituate and become bored, turning a perceived weakness into a strength for consistent action [00:09:00]. It aligns with [[techniques for overcoming procrastination | techniques for overcoming procrastination]] by focusing on the "doing nothing" part of resisting the craving [00:08:23].

## Important Considerations

*   **Powerful Cravings**: It's natural to think that your cravings are too powerful for this technique to work [00:09:18]. However, this thought itself is the mind resisting a technique that could work [00:09:28].
*   **Start Small**: You don't have to tackle your biggest cravings first [00:10:00]. Focus on the easier cravings (e.g., 25% of them) to build the skill [00:10:07].
*   **Skill Building**: Urge surfing is a skill that develops over time [00:10:20]. Even if some cravings seem too strong to handle, practice with others will strengthen your ability [00:10:32].

### Practical Application

Consider your experience watching this video: it's likely that at some point, your mind wanted to switch off [00:10:44]. By making it to the end, you have already successfully urge surfed, experiencing a craving to switch that eventually "melted away" without you giving in [00:11:04]. This demonstrates that you already possess the ability to apply this technique to other areas of your life [00:11:23].

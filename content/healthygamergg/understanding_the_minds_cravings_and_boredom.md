To effectively follow through on tasks, it is crucial to [[understanding_how_the_mind_works_for_effective_studying | understand how our mind works]] rather than trying to overcome it with willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>. Willpower creates a "war with our mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>, which often leads to failure in creating sustainable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. The key is to use the natural tendencies of the mind to achieve consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:48">[02:44:48]</a>.

## Natural Tendencies of the Mind

The mind exhibits two primary natural tendencies:

1.  **Curiosity and Engagement**
    The mind is inherently curious and enjoys engaging with new things, whether it's new TV shows, learning instruments, or other novel activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>. This engagement often results in a dopamine release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:41">[03:23:41]</a>.

2.  **Development of Tolerance**
    The mind develops tolerance to any kind of stimuli over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:09">[03:28:09]</a>.
    *   **Sensory Example**: When you first put on a shirt, you feel it, but you quickly acclimatize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>. Similarly, a bad smell in a public restroom becomes more tolerable the longer you stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>.
    *   **Dopaminergic Example**: The first bite of cake or pizza is the most enjoyable; subsequent bites lead to a decline in enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This also applies to activities like playing video games, where prolonged engagement leads to [[role_of_boredom_and_introspection | boredom]] and a desire to switch to something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>.

The challenge in following through arises when the mind develops tolerance to the current activity and subsequently craves a different one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:09">[06:35:09]</a>. It's not that staying on task is inherently hard, but that the mind desires something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. These cravings can manifest as desires to watch TV, check social media, look at memes, text friends, play video games, or watch [[understanding_pornography_addiction | pornography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

## Urge Surfing Technique

Instead of fighting the mind's tendency to get [[role_of_boredom_and_introspection | bored]] and crave new stimuli, we can use a technique called [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | urge surfing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

> "What we're going to learn how to do today is [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | urge surf]] so [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | urge surfing]] is a technique that we use in addiction Psychiatry to help people withstand the Cravings to substances that they're addicted to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

The general principle of [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | urge surfing]] is that if you can tolerate an urge or craving for a period without giving in, the urge will eventually subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The mind develops tolerance to its own cravings, eventually getting [[role_of_boredom_and_introspection | bored]] of wanting something if it doesn't receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. For example, if you crave pizza on an airplane where it's unavailable, your mind will eventually stop craving it over the duration of the flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

Cravings can be incredibly intense, even for those addicted to substances like alcohol or heroin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Yet, [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | urge surfing]] has proven effective in these contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

## Applying Urge Surfing to Follow-Through

When struggling to follow through, the desire to switch tasks is itself a craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. To apply [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | urge surfing]]:

1.  **Notice the Urge**: Become aware of the desire to switch tasks or do something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify Mind's Tricks**: The mind may try to convince you to give in by saying things like, "this is [[role_of_boredom_and_introspection | boring]]," "it's a waste of time," or "we'll do it tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Recognize these as attempts to trick you into seeking a dopamine hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
3.  **Surf the Urge**: Instead of acting on the craving, simply notice it and do not give in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This is about [[tolerating_boredom_for_increased_attention | tolerating boredom]] and the craving itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
4.  **Trust the Process**: Understand that no craving or feeling lasts forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. By [[tolerating_boredom_for_increased_attention | tolerating boredom]] and the urge, the mind will eventually get [[role_of_boredom_and_introspection | bored]] of wanting the alternative and naturally return to the task you intend to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. This helps in [[managing_minds_desire_to_switch_tasks | managing the mind's desire to switch tasks]].

### Addressing Common Challenges

*   **"My cravings are too powerful"**: This is a common thought and an example of the mind's [[understanding_the_minds_defense_mechanisms | defense mechanisms]] trying to prevent you from trying a technique that works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Instead of focusing on the most powerful cravings, start with smaller, more manageable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **Skill Building**: [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | Urge surfing]] is a skill that improves over time with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

### Self-Observation

If you have made it to the end of this video, you have likely already engaged in [[urge_surfing_technique_for_overcoming_cravings | urge surfing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. At some point, your mind probably wanted to switch off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. By observing how you stayed engaged, you can see that the craving to switch likely arose and then melted away, demonstrating the effectiveness of the technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. The key is to apply this observed ability to other areas of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

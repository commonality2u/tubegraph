One significant reason why thoughts in one's mind may not translate perfectly into spoken words is due to assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. When an individual thinks, they hold a multitude of assumptions that are perfectly clear to them because they originate from their own understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. However, when these thoughts are verbalized, these underlying assumptions are often missing, leading to garbled or misunderstood communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Bridging the Gap Caused by Assumptions

To effectively communicate, it is crucial to address and manage these assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The key lies in engaging the [[cognitive_processes_and_communication | empathic circuits of the brain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Empathy and Audience Understanding
Effective communicators, much like authors who meticulously craft narratives to account for what readers know versus what they need to learn, must put themselves in the shoes of their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This means understanding their own assumptions and considering how to ensure the audience comprehends those assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The "in-between stuff"—the unstated context and assumed knowledge—is often what's missing when thoughts fail to translate effectively into speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. By becoming more [[importance_of_communication_skills_in_charisma | empathic]] and considering the audience's perspective, communication can improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Being a successful psychiatrist, therapist, friend, or parent involves acknowledging one's own assumptions and meeting others where they are at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Instead of expecting the audience to "understand" from one's own starting point, effective communication involves understanding the audience's current knowledge and building upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Summary
The biggest gaps in communication stem from unaddressed assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. To be an effective communicator, it is essential to engage [[cognitive_processes_and_communication | empathic circuitry]] to understand what the other person already knows and what they need to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This approach involves moving from the audience's current understanding towards the intended message, rather than trying to force the audience to meet one's own understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

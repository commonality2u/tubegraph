Society often portrays sex as universally fantastic and consistently great [00:00:02], a magical milestone that once achieved, resolves all personal issues and instantly boosts confidence and status [00:02:42]. This idealized view is frequently perpetuated, suggesting that every sexual encounter will be awesome [00:00:06]. However, this perspective overlooks the complexities and potential initial difficulties of real-world sexual experiences [00:03:09].

## The Incels' Fantasy vs. Reality

Individuals, including those from [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]] communities, often hold a fantasy about what sex entails [00:02:07]. They may believe that having sex even once will liberate them from being an [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]], making everything "amazing" and transforming them into a "Chad" [00:02:11]. This belief system suggests that a single sexual experience is a golden threshold [00:02:50].

A compelling example of this disconnect comes from a 32-year-old former [[the_concept_of_incels_and_their_perceptions_of_sex | incel]] who had sex for the first time:
> "I am a former incel 32m... who had sex for the first time today and was grossed out. After a two-year self-improvement journey I was able to get a woman to sleep with me on our fifth date... I'm not sure what I was expecting to feel but my eggplant felt really weird inside I didn't bother to finish because I lost my boner got a little queasy and just said I wasn't ready after all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

This individual also expressed concern about [[effect_of_pornography_on_sexual_health_and_relationships | porn addiction]] and [[impact_of_porn_consumption_on_mental_health_and_relationships | porn preferences]]:
> "I successfully completed no not November in an attempt to escape porn addiction and be interested in real sex... I developed some disturbing porn fetishes that got really bad after a knee surgery... I worry that the porn preferences might be corrupting my normal sexual appetite." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

This case highlights that simply "getting laid" does not inherently solve all problems [00:03:12], and that sexual experiences can be far more complicated than idealized fantasies suggest [00:03:09].

## Common Myths of Sex

The way society talks about and depicts sex leads to several prevalent myths:

*   **Myth #1: The first time will be amazing.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> This is often not true, especially for women, where initial experiences can be painful or less pleasurable [00:06:07]. Teenagers, for instance, may experience awkwardness as partners might not know how to bring them to orgasm intuitively [00:07:00]. Movies and media often perpetuate a fantasy of perfect first encounters, featuring romantic settings and instant gratification, which is unrealistic [00:07:44].
*   **Myth #2: Every time will be amazing.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> Also not true. Sex, like any skill, requires practice and can be awkward or unfulfilling until one gains experience [00:08:00]. It's comparable to learning to cook, where the first attempts may not be great, but consistent effort leads to better results [00:06:37].

### The "Loose Vagina" Myth

A common misconception circulating online is that a woman's vagina becomes "loose" if she has sex with many different partners, or even with the same partner repeatedly [00:21:01]. This is physiologically incorrect [00:21:56]. The body is elastic; just as eating a large sandwich doesn't permanently keep one's mouth open, or passing large stools doesn't permanently loosen the anus, sexual activity does not alter the inherent elasticity of the vagina [00:21:17]. These beliefs are unfounded and contribute to unfair judgments against individuals [00:23:30].

## Overcoming Sexual Difficulties

Many individuals experience common difficulties in their [[exploration_of_sexual_health_and_overcoming_initial_sexual_disappointments | sexual health]] journey.

### Death Grip Syndrome

One common issue, especially for men who have been [[historical_and_medical_perspectives_on_masturbation | masturbating]] for many years (e.g., 18 years), is "death grip syndrome" [00:08:33]. This occurs when the body becomes physically conditioned to a specific type of stimulation to achieve climax, often characterized by a strong grip and lack of lubrication [00:08:55]. When engaging in vaginal intercourse, which provides different stimulation, individuals may find it difficult to climax, leading to psychological problems, flaccidity, and shame [00:09:34].

Symptoms of this conditioning include:
*   Requiring a certain grip strength [00:09:13].
*   A preference for a lack of lubrication [00:09:16].

### Psychological Impact

When initial sexual experiences are not as expected, individuals may question their sexuality, wondering if they are asexual or "messed up" [00:09:52]. This can lead to self-doubt and potentially adopting labels like "asexual" prematurely, which might prevent them from exploring and reconditioning their bodies for different sexual experiences [00:18:10]. While being asexual is valid, a negative first experience alone does not necessarily mean someone is asexual [00:18:26].

### Solutions and Strategies

The good news is that conditioned responses can be deconditioned [00:10:25]. Overcoming these difficulties involves:

1.  **Deconditioning "Death Grip Syndrome":**
    *   **Using more lubrication:** Start incorporating lotion or other lubricants during self-stimulation to accustom the body to less friction [00:11:03].
    *   **Using a looser grip:** Consciously reduce grip strength during self-stimulation to mimic the different pressure experienced during intercourse [00:11:27]. This will feel unsatisfying at first, but is necessary for re-entrainment [00:11:38].

2.  **Partner Involvement and Exploration:**
    *   A supportive partner is invaluable for this journey [00:12:01].
    *   Explore different erogenous zones beyond just genitals, such as hands, breasts, or even feet [00:12:22].
    *   Sexual activity can involve various combinations of stimulation from both partners, getting creative like "balancing flavors" in cooking [00:15:26].
    *   Partners can work together, for instance, the partner using their hand to stimulate the penis if the individual requires a specific grip, while also engaging in other forms of intimacy [00:15:52].
    *   Gradually combine different methods of stimulation. For example, getting 90% of the way to climax with one method, then transitioning to another that is less intense but still allows for completion [00:16:29]. This helps the body re-entrain to new types of stimulation [00:16:43].

This process requires patience and experimentation [00:19:54]. Sex is a practice that involves both body and mind, and just like learning to enjoy spicy food, it takes time to adjust and appreciate different sensations [00:17:31].

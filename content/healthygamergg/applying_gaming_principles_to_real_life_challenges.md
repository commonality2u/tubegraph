This article explores how concepts from video games can be applied to address real-life challenges, particularly in developing [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | consistency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Many [[Gamers and realworld challenges | gamers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> aim to "level up" stats like motivation, discipline, willpower, or habit building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, the core problem with developing consistency is often an ignorance of one's true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Illusion of a Consistent Self

The concept that the source of suffering stems from *avidya*, or ignorance of our true selves, was discovered by yogis thousands of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. In daily life, individuals often feel like they are not the same person every day, wishing they could be the person who was productive on a specific past day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The "you" actually fluctuates, running deeper than just desires or emotions, extending to values and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. For example, a decision made on January 1st to learn an instrument might be abandoned by January 3rd because the person's values have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Attempting to build a consistent life while assuming a consistent self is inherently flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Life as a "Multiplayer Game"

A key insight is to understand that life is not played by one consistent person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Instead, it can be viewed as a multiplayer game where "random people" wake up in one's life each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Each daily "player" only gets to be in charge for that moment in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Future Discounting and Procrastination

Humans have evolved with "future discounting," a neurological bias to value immediate rewards more than distant ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain, is wired to value immediate things more than distant ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This wiring leads to procrastination, as the brain values fun today more than fun tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This explains why people often "screw over tomorrow you" by leaving tasks for the next day's "noob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, and then get frustrated with "the dude that came before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A lack of stewardship for the future is similar to how public toilets are often left a mess because people don't expect to use them again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Stewardship: Playing for the Next "Player"

To achieve [[developing_consistency_in_life_as_a_gamer | consistency]], one must embrace the reality of being a temporary custodian of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Just as in a body-swap comedy, each "person" inhabits the life for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The key is to act as a custodian, setting things up better for the next person who inherits the life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

This concept can be understood through gaming examples:

*   **MOBA Analogy**: If playing a MOBA for only five minutes, substituting for a friend, a responsible player will strive to play their best to improve the game state for the next person, even without experiencing the joy of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Games go wrong when a temporary player gives up or "tilts" because they think the game is lost, screwing over the next person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Top Chef Challenge**: In a "Top Chef" relay challenge, chefs cook for five minutes and then pass the dish to the next chef, who must understand the previous chef's intent and continue their process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Living life this way—as a custodian for today, without the expectation of winning in the end—can paradoxically build consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### The Role of Self-Compassion

For this approach to work, self-compassion is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. People struggle with motivation if they don't love themselves, as sacrifices are typically made for things considered "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. If one doesn't care about their future self, there's no incentive to make sacrifices today for a better tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

By accepting that one is merely a temporary custodian, constantly "spawning into this person's life," it becomes possible to choose to set things up better for the person who will inherit tomorrow, rather than creating a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This paradoxical understanding of life, informed by gaming principles, can help overcome *avidya* and reduce suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

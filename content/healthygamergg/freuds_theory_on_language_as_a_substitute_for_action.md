Dr. K, a psychiatrist who previously studied to be a monk, explains that in order to cultivate motivation, one must understand the principle that language can serve as a substitute for action, a discovery attributed to Sigmund Freud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:30">[06:04:30]</a>. This concept suggests that talking about goals can diminish the internal energy required to achieve them, leading to a leakage of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## The Principle of Energy Depletion

The idea that verbal expression can deplete internal energy is observed in various contexts:

### Psychotherapy and Trauma
In psychotherapy, particularly for traumatized individuals, venting past trauma or negative emotions is a core evidence-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. When someone shares their trauma, shame, and negative emotions in a non-judgmental, compassionate space, the power of that negativity over their life diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This process of externalizing negativity through speech reduces its internal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This aligns with [[understanding_the_minds_defense_mechanisms | understanding the mind's defense mechanisms]] and [[alexithymias_role_in_addiction_and_emotional_coping_mechanisms | emotional coping mechanisms]].

### The Mantra Principle
Conversely, a tantric Guru taught Dr. K that a mantra, kept secret and chanted internally, grows in power, leading to material and spiritual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This is the opposite of venting; it involves cultivating something positive internally without expressing it externally, thus compounding positive energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Language and Action: An Intrinsic Link
Freud's discovery posits that language and action are intrinsically tied, drawing from the same pool of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This means that speaking about something can act as a substitute for actually doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. For example, a grieving person who couldn't tell a loved one "I love you" before they passed can find a form of completion by talking to their grave, serving as a substitute for the unfulfilled action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

### The "Talkers" vs. "Doers" Phenomenon
This shared energy pool explains why there are typically "talkers" and "doers," but rarely individuals who excel at both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **External Reinforcement:** When people talk about what they *will* do (e.g., aspiring doctors at 17, "entrepreneur bros" on social media), they often receive positive external reinforcement like impressed reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This reinforces the act of talking, not doing, and provides a reward without actual effort, causing motivation to "leak away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Gaming Community Example:** Similarly, in gaming, individuals who spend time "theory crafting" and arguing online about their skills are often not the ones actually performing well in the game; the true players are "playing the game instead of posting about it on Reddit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Motivation through Silence

To prevent motivation from leaking away and to [[the_role_of_conscious_and_unconscious_thoughts_in_motivation | cultivate motivation]], the principle is to keep positive goals and intentions internal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
*   **Pay Attention to Your Speech:** Observe how often you talk about what you want to do versus what you actually do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. There's often an inverse correlation between talking about something and doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   **"Shut the Hell Up":** Especially on social media, avoid constantly posting about hopes and dreams. The less you talk, the more you can accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Introvert Advantage:** Introverts naturally tend to talk less about their plans, which gives them a natural advantage in storing and channeling internal energy into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Intentional Communication:** While silence is generally advised for personal goals, intentional, scoped conversations are acceptable when there's a clear, outweighing benefit, such as specific collaborations or seeking specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. Every word spoken depletes motivation, so communication comes at a cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of [[cognitive_processes_and_communication | focused communication]].
*   **Journaling with Re-internalization:** For negative emotions, journaling can be a useful tool to vent energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. However, when journaling about positive goals, it's crucial to re-internalize that energy by reading the journal, bringing the positive thoughts back within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

In summary, to prevent motivation from dissipating, cultivate positive energy internally by keeping goals private, allowing that pressure to build up and channel into action instead of words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

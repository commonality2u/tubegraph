The human mind often tells an individual "not today, not today" or "not now, not now" when faced with tasks that need to be done, presenting "a thousand reasons" for not being ready, such as potential failure or inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This internal conflict raises questions about when to consider a day a "write-off" and how to avoid judging oneself harshly for lack of focus, despite an honest effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This phenomenon can occur seemingly without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Problem of Mental Compliance

There are times when one genuinely needs to get work done, but the mind simply refuses to focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The mind may declare, "Sorry bro, I'm not just gonna do it today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This leads to a dilemma: should one accept the day as lost, or continue to try and force productivity, often resorting to other tasks like cleaning or running errands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The underlying issue is that the mind doesn't always do what we want it to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Self-Judgment vs. Acceptance

This situation can lead to a tricky choice: either beat oneself up for not focusing or embrace a "new age, positive emotion" of acceptance, forgiving oneself for the lack of productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The balance between pushing oneself to work and practicing self-love and self-compassion becomes blurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The desire not to "waste the day" often drives individuals to engage in "productive" distractions, which can lead to guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Ultimately, many people just "try again tomorrow and hope that things work out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Understanding Human Performance and the Mind

Performance is not solely correlated with knowledge or expertise; it is highly variable depending on how the brain is functioning on a given day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For example, in finance, experts might see patterns and make correct investment choices when their brain is working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Similarly, in esports, despite increasing knowledge with each game, performance is wildly variable, and players often don't know how to cultivate the right "state of mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

The ability to perform well or focus often comes down to achieving a certain state of mind and controlling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Self vs. Mind: A Fundamental Distinction

There are different parts of an individual's mind that conflict: the part that knows it needs to focus ("I need to focus") and the part that doesn't want to ("Mind doesn't want to focus") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This indicates that there are "different parts of you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

The "Self" is able to direct the mind, but the mind doesn't always comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. From a neuroscience perspective, the ability of the "Self" to prevail involves the frontal lobes, which are responsible for impulse control, delayed gratification, and directing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The goal is to strengthen these frontal lobes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

The concept of "self" and "mind" as distinct entities stems from experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Through practices like [[Mindfulness and meditation for controlling attention and selfawareness | meditation]], one can observe the actions of the mind and realize that it is a *part* of one's being, but not the entirety of the "self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. The "self" can be understood as consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, and experiencing existence "without mental activity" reveals what the "self" truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. The mind is not the physical brain; the brain is an organ, while the mind is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. While brain injuries can drastically alter personalities, suggesting a correlation, the experience of consciousness (qualia) is distinct from physical form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## The Mind's Secret Weapon: Boredom

The mind's power over an individual revolves around boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The more one engages in dopaminergic activities like using a cell phone or playing video games, the more intolerant to boredom one becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. The mind plays a "waiting game," knowing that an individual cannot tolerate boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. If the mind doesn't focus on work and allows itself to be distracted, boredom sets in, leading to temporary "productive" activities (like cleaning) to avoid "wasting time," before eventually succumbing to dopamine-releasing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### The Power of Accepting Boredom

To train the mind to focus, the key is to eliminate all other options besides work, boredom, or sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This means removing productive distractions (like cleaning or errands) and dopaminergic activities (like video games) from the table, unless they are already scheduled tasks and not simply an "antidote to boredom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

If the mind doesn't want to work, one should sit and do nothing. The "self" can tolerate boredom better than the mind, which will eventually find boredom intolerable and choose to focus on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This is how one practices focusing: by persistently trying until the mind begins to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. [[Mindfulness and meditation techniques | Meditation]] is an example of "sitting there doing nothing with a no mind state," which, while seemingly boring, can be a wonderful experience for the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Cultivating Control Through Self-Awareness and Acceptance

The mind is "incredibly slippery" and will offer any excuse to avoid doing what it doesn't want to do, knowing that if it can stall long enough, frustration will lead to giving up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. This trickery can cause individuals to waste their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

To counter this, individuals must be willing to "waste a day" by sitting and doing nothing until the mind complies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This is not holding oneself hostage, but holding the mind hostage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Once the mind understands that there are no other options, it will "get in the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

### A [[Mindfulness and meditation techniques | Meditation]]-like Approach

When struggling to work, one can sit and observe the mind's resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>:
*   Notice the thought, "I don't feel like working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   Prepare for work and observe what "I don't feel like working" actually means: is it a feeling, or thoughts wandering and leading to frustration? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   Recognize that engaging in productive distractions (like cleaning) is giving in to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. Tolerating frustration is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   Observe the mind's excuses, such as "I don't know what to write" or "I'm not confident," which can lead to endless "research" to avoid the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   As the "self," one might need to tell the mind, "too bad," and insist on putting words on a page, even if they are "crappy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

By sitting and paying attention to the mind, one will notice its "slippery" nature and its attempts to create excuses to avoid work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. All roads lead to the same conclusion: "don't write" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Once this pattern is recognized, one can understand it as "BS" and choose to start writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

## Attention and Motivation

Ultimately, "doing stuff" is about controlling one's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. When one "can't study," it means attention is not going where it's directed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Similarly, inability to stop playing video games is due to attention being constantly on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

While often attributed to "weak willpower," this is an unsophisticated term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Willpower is used to overcome motivation, but neuroscientific calculations can be manipulated to create more motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

A key part of the brain's "action-success calculation" is the perceived likelihood of success for a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>. If success is perceived as likely, motivation increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. [[Selfawareness and mental health | Self-worth]] is a huge part of this calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. Increasing self-worth and confidence alters the perception of success likelihood, thereby boosting motivation to pursue desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. Understanding this "equation" of how the mind works allows for altering variables to "calculate motivation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

Many people believe that charisma is primarily tied to physical attractiveness, but research indicates that physical attractiveness accounts for only about 10.5% of the variance in charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Most individuals are of average or below-average attractiveness, yet can still develop significant charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The good news is that there are attributes of charisma that are far more important and can be learned and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Components of Charisma
Modern research identifies six dimensions of charisma, with physical attractiveness being just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Three attributes stand out as more significant than physical attractiveness, cumulatively accounting for about half of the charisma an individual exudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. These are:

*   [[authenticity_in_personal_charisma | Authenticity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>
*   [[importance_of_communication_skills_in_charisma | Communication skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, specifically communication style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>

## Communication Style as a Core Charismatic Trait
[[importance_of_communication_skills_in_charisma | Communication skills]] are identified as the most important aspect of charisma, with a person who "attracts admiration and inspires" demonstrating this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This [[techniques_for_effective_communication | communication style]] is built upon and amplifies the other two key attributes: vision and authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. To enhance your charisma through communication, you should:

### 1. Communicate Your Vision
When you communicate, share what your [[role_of_vision_and_vision_implementation_in_charisma | vision]] is with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>. This means conveying your ideals and the direction you want your life to go, rather than just listing goals or achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### 2. Practice Authentic Communication
Communication should be [[authenticity_in_personal_charisma | authentic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. Authenticity helps people trust you, which is a significant part of charisma, especially in a world often characterized by distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. While sharing some negativity can be authentic, it's crucial to temper your authenticity with compassion. This means considering how your communication affects others and allowing truthfulness to be in service to compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.

### 3. Strive for Clarity in Communication
Charismatic individuals are often noted for their very clear communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. A simple and effective [[techniques_for_effective_communication | technique]] to achieve this clarity is to [[practicing_effective_communication_skills | practice writing]] about what you intend to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>.

By writing out your thoughts, you engage in a process of verbalization that clarifies your thinking before you speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. This ensures that when you do open your mouth, your words come out clearly and competently because the thought process has already been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. Most people think as they speak, which can lead to less clear and profound conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>. The act of writing can lead to "brilliant Revelations" in your conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.

By focusing on [[role_of_vision_and_vision_implementation_in_charisma | vision and vision implementation]], [[authenticity_in_personal_charisma | authenticity]], and clear [[importance_of_communication_skills_in_charisma | communication]], you can significantly [[developing_charisma_beyond_physical_attractiveness | develop Charisma even if you're unattractive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. These learnable traits can notably improve your charisma, regardless of your physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>.

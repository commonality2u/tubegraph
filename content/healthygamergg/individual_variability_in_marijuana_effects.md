When discussing the effects of marijuana, it's important to recognize that a substance acts within an individual body, meaning the effects are filtered through each unique human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:03">[07:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## The Individual Factor

Scientifically, when the "effects of marijuana" are discussed, it typically refers to an average of effects observed across many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. However, there is no single, universal "effect of marijuana" because the drug interacts differently with each person's unique physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

Each individual's receptors, metabolism, and brain structure are different, leading to a slightly varied presentation of effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Consequently, one compound can act slightly differently when administered to a thousand different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Analogy: Antidepressants

This concept is evident in prescription medicine, such as antidepressants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. There isn't one antidepressant that works equally well for all people; instead, there are often dozens of antidepressants, each with varying efficacy across different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. This highlights that there is no one-size-fits-all solution in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

## Personalized Approach

Due to this individual variability, there is a significant degree of "individuation" in a person's relationship to any substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This is why advice for [[medical_uses_for_marijuana | medical cannabis users]] emphasizes consulting a doctor, as the risks and benefits must be assessed on an individualized basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

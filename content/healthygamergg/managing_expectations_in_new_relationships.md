It is a common and unfortunate pattern in new relationships for initial intense engagement to lead to a gradual fading of connection, or even a complete cessation of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This can lead individuals to struggle between being an "authentic good person" (which may lead to disengagement) and being less caring to maintain interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This dilemma often forces people into two unhealthy extremes: becoming "clingy" or becoming "uncaring," both of which are toxic over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Good Diagnosis Precedes Good Treatment
To address this pattern, it's crucial to first understand the underlying problem within oneself before attempting to correct behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### The Intensity of Initial Interactions
A key observation about people who become clingy is the excessive intensity of their first interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. There's a saying: "the brightest flame burns out the quickest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While not everyone in this situation has Borderline Personality Disorder, very intense, "rocket fuel" level relationships that quickly run out of fuel are a clinically observed pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Healthy relationships generally form slowly and build gradually over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Unhealthy relationship formations, conversely, often start with high intensity and then rapidly decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Understanding Your Own [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | Emotional Needs]]
It's vital to understand what you are trying to get out of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. When you're texting someone for hours, reflect on:
*   Are you genuinely enjoying the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>?
*   Are you simply "chilling and having a good time," in which case a fizzle shouldn't bother you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>?
*   Or are you hopeful, attaching some kind of subconscious expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>?

Often, when individuals attach expectations (e.g., being lonely, romantically interested), they might engage in "love bombing" by excessive compliments or "good morning texts" to try and stack the deck in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Good morning texts, unless in an intimate relationship, can signal a level of intimacy that the other person is not comfortable with, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

If you have a romantic intention, the direct approach is often best: just ask them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Fear of rejection often leads to these indirect behaviors, which can result in being "friend-zoned" because intentions aren't clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Understanding Clinginess
Clinginess fundamentally stems from unmet [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | emotional needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Similar to children clinging to parents when feeling unsafe, or stray cats following someone who feeds them, a person becomes clingy when someone inadvertently meets a high, intense [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | emotional need]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

When there's a mismatch between your high intensity of interaction (e.g., good morning texts, compliments) and their lower level of engagement, it leads to a decrease in overall communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

The phenomenon of getting more responses when "stopping to care" is because you are artificially and arguably toxically reducing your own [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | emotional need]] to match their lower level, leading to an increase in communication because you're both on the same page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Understanding the Other Person's Experience
A common oversight is a complete lack of understanding of the other person's experience, their desires, or what they want from the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Many people are not taught how to form a [[healthy_communication_in_relationships | healthy relationship]], leading them to discover "artificial, toxic ways of not caring" to match perceived engagement levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This can result in becoming unfeeling and uncaring, which is detrimental to long-term [[navigating_longterm_relationships | relationship dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

To foster [[healthy_communication_in_relationships | healthy communication]] and manage expectations:
*   **Define the Relationship (DTR)**: Consider having a [[healthy_communication_in_relationships | Define the Relationship]] (DTR) conversation. This can apply even to friendships. For example, asking a friend who doesn't often play games if they still want to be invited to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Observe and Adjust**: Instead of immediately sending frequent texts, observe if they message you. If they don't after a reasonable time, a simple "Hey, I really enjoyed our conversation yesterday, hope you're doing well" can suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Tennis Ball Analogy**: In healthy communication, it's like playing tennis â€“ you hit the ball over and wait for them to hit it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Being "clingy" is like being a tennis ball machine, sending text after text, which can overwhelm the other person and make them shut down or block you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Patience and Forgiveness**: It's okay to give someone a couple of days and text them again. Life happens, and they might have legitimate reasons for not responding immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
*   **Direct Questions (when appropriate)**: If someone consistently doesn't engage, a direct, non-aggressive question can clarify, e.g., "I've invited you a couple times, seems like you've been busy. Do you want me to continue inviting you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-explaining Anxieties**: Don't share all your anxieties immediately ("I have anxiety, I'm afraid you're abandoning me") as this can be overwhelming for the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Conclusion
The experience of meeting someone, hitting it off, and then finding the connection fade is very common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. While it's normal to want to continue a positive interaction, attaching unrealistic expectations and over-communicating can overwhelm the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

When you find yourself getting clingy and being shut down, you might inadvertently learn to "stop caring" to get a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This artificial reduction in your [[emotional_needs_and_relationship_dynamics | emotional need]] might match their comfort level, leading to more responses, but it risks making you toxic in how you approach [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | other people and relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

To foster [[healthy_communication_in_relationships | healthy communication]] and [[managing_anxiety_and_emotional_needs_in_relationships | manage anxiety]] in [[navigating_longterm_relationships | new relationships]]:
*   **Understand Your Own Needs**: Reflect on what needs are being met and why you are so drawn to the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.
*   **Consider the Other Person's Perspective**: Gauge their level of interest and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **Scale Up Interaction Slowly**: Allow relationships to form gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.
*   **Be Explicit with Intentions**: If you have a clear romantic interest, communicate it directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Define the Relationship (DTR)**: When appropriate, have conversations to clarify expectations and dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **Practice Patience and Empathy**: Give space, be forgiving, and allow others to meet you where you are, or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

By understanding your own needs and being more empathetic towards others, your relationships can improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

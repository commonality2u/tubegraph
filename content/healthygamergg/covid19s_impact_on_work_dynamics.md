The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered work dynamics, acting as a "great example of the blindfold coming off" for employees regarding traditional work structures and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Unveiling the Myth of the Office

For a long time, companies assumed or led their employees to believe that physical presence in an office was necessary for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Commuting, often consuming 30 minutes to two hours of an employee's day, was considered a given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. However, COVID-19 revealed that many jobs did not require commuting or office presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This realization was a "huge revelation" for many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Removal of Geographical Restrictions

Historically, job options were often restricted by an individual's geography, particularly in "company towns" where one major employer dominated local work opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Corporations engaged in "geographical predation," benefiting from employees' limited local choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

With the advent of the internet, and especially with COVID-19 prompting widespread work-from-home policies, employees are no longer geographically restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This means an employee in one state or even country can apply for a job elsewhere, reducing the power of local employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This shift is a reversal of a trend companies previously embraced, such as outsourcing jobs overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Re-evaluation of Priorities

COVID-19 also prompted people to reconsider what they truly needed for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The traditional idea of "the grind"—working intensely for 40 years to retire at 65 and enjoy life—was challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. People realized they didn't need as much money as they thought and that additional income might not be worth significant sacrifices of time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This re-evaluation led many to question their priorities and what they were willing to sacrifice for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## COVID-19 as a "Selection Pressure"

The pandemic effectively acted as a "selection pressure" on jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Previously, poor company practices went unchecked because there were no significant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Companies became "bloated [and] profit driven" due to a lack of negative selection pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

However, with the increased awareness and options brought about by COVID-19, workers are now collectively "selecting for a particular kind of job and select against another kind of job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This has led to what some call a "labor shortage," but is more accurately described as a "wage shortage" or a shortage of desirable working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Companies that have historically invalidated their workers' experiences or blamed employees for issues (e.g., "lazy workers") are now facing significant turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

Companies now have two choices: continue invalidating employee experiences and risking closure, or begin to listen to their workers and adapt their work environments to make them more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Companies like Google and Costco are cited as examples of employers that foster positive work environments, leading to higher employee satisfaction and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

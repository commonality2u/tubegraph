Individuals with a history of [[childhood_trauma_and_its_effects | traumatic upbringing]] may struggle with forming and maintaining healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This often manifests as an initial guardedness followed by becoming overly clingy and invested, eventually driving others away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## The Cycle of Clinginess and Rejection

The pattern often begins when a person, who usually feels guarded and secretive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, starts to form a healthy connection with someone and they click quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, when the other person's circumstances (e.g., getting busy) cause them to become less available, the individual with trauma history becomes anxious and clingy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This increased anxiety leads to obsessive behaviors, such as texting excessively, seemingly to remind the other person they still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This often results in the other person pulling away, eventually blocking contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Childhood Trauma and Self-Perception

The root of this behavior often stems from [[impact_of_childhood_and_upbringing_on_mental_health_and_behaviors | childhood and upbringing]], particularly experiences of [[childhood_trauma_and_its_effects | childhood trauma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Examples include being bullied by family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, told one was an embarrassment or had the "wrong personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, or even being told no one would mourn their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Such experiences teach individuals to feel responsible for others' feelings about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> and lead to a deep-seated self-blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. They learn that they are not worthy, and people don't want to be their friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This psychological trauma is carried into adulthood, making it difficult to tolerate any perceived distance in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

## The Role of Anxiety and Fear

When a partner pulls away due to external circumstances, the childhood fear of abandonment and worthlessness activates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This causes intense anxiety, which the individual tries to alleviate by seeking reassurance from the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The internal need for validation becomes a demand placed on the relationship, often unconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The individual feels they "don't exist" in the relationship and tries to force the other person to acknowledge their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. As responses from the other person shorten, this fear intensifies, leading to even more desperate attempts for connection, creating a vicious cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Miscommunication and Unmet Needs

A major problem is that these intense emotional needs are not communicated clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The person is "stuck in their own head," creating a "different song" to which they are dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The long, anxious texts are not understood by the recipient, who only sees confusing or desperate behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This lack of awareness on the part of the recipient often leads them to withdraw, reinforcing the individual's core fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Taking Responsibility and Finding Solutions

While it's important not to blame oneself entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, taking at least 50% responsibility for patterns in relationships is crucial for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. With responsibility comes the agency to change things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Key steps to breaking this cycle include:

*   **Understanding Emotional Needs:** Identify the specific emotions and fears that arise when perceived distance occurs (e.g., "What is it like to feel like you don't exist anymore?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Processing Emotions:** Actively work on processing these underlying feelings and needs to reduce the emotional energy driving the clingy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Simply trying to suppress the behavior (e.g., not texting) is insufficient, as the tension will build and eventually break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Communication:** Either process internal "baggage" to align with the other person, or communicate where you are emotionally so they can understand and potentially meet you halfway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. This means vocalizing your feelings directly rather than acting them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.
*   **Seeking Support:** Therapy, coaching, or group coaching can be invaluable for working through these deep-seated issues and learning healthy relationship skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Group coaching specifically provides a structured environment to practice communication and forming relationships with healthy boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

## Learning to Let Go

A critical aspect is learning to let go when someone is genuinely leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Often, people assume someone is leaving because of them, but many part ways due to a myriad of reasons unrelated to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Even if compatibility is an issue, it is normal not to be compatible with everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. The goal is a relationship where both parties genuinely want to be together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Breaking the Cycle

The difficulty in making friends can lead to becoming overly attached to potential connections, putting too much "luggage" (past trauma and unmet needs) onto new relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. This overbearing emotional weight drives people away, adding more "luggage" to the individual's burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. The key is to "offload the luggage" by processing the trauma and anxieties from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. By understanding and working through these [[impact_of_childhood_and_trauma_on_mental_health | emotional needs]] rather than acting them out, individuals can break the cycle of self-sabotage and build healthier, more secure [[impact_of_trauma_and_family_relationships | relationships]].

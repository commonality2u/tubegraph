When dealing with a problem, finding and addressing its core can cause other related issues to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle applies to understanding how the mind protects itself from perceived threats, such as social rejection.

## Core Beliefs and Their Impact

A fundamental aspect of these challenges stems from [[psychological_concepts_and_selfunderstanding | core beliefs]] about oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Examples include believing "I am too boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> or "I am not valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. These beliefs can lead to a fear of interacting with others, both in reality and online, due to the concern of being perceived as uninteresting or having nothing of value to offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This fear can manifest as ghosting people after initiating contact, driven by the desire to avoid having others realize one's perceived lack of substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Cycle of Avoidance and Reinforcement

The mind often engages in a cycle of building courage to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, only for that courage to dissipate, leading to ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This pattern, where courage competes with the tendency to ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, is often influenced by [[the_neuroscience_behind_self_control_and_conflict_monitoring | willpower]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While willpower can temporarily bolster courage, it is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As willpower decreases, the tendency to ghost takes over, resulting in feelings of guilt and worthlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. These negative feelings then reinforce the initial core beliefs, making them stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Rationalizations as Defense Mechanisms

To protect against this cycle of rejection and negative self-perception, the mind employs [[minds_protective_mechanisms_and_negative_possibilities | rationalizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. These are often illogical fears, such as the belief that potential friends are "too cool" or "on a different level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, or that close friends cannot realize one's perceived flaws because they are "too close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The mind rationalizes that there is "no point in trying to hang out if they are going to find out eventually" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This serves to protect against the painful cycle of reaching out, ghosting, and feeling bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The mind essentially says, "reaching out just makes you feel bad, and that's why we don't do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## The Root: Self-Value and Samskara

The underlying issue often revolves around the core belief of not being valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. As long as this belief persists, the entire pattern of avoidance and self-reinforcement will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Working on symptomatic relief, such as stopping ghosting, is an "adaptation of an adaptation of an adaptation" and is far from the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The [[psychological_concepts_and_selfunderstanding | sense of self]], or Ahamkara, plays a significant role, as it can lead to idealizing others and viewing oneself as a "bad person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Identifying and dismantling this core belief, often referred to as a "sum scar" (samskara), is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Addressing the Core Problem

When the core belief is identified and addressed, the entire complex of related issues tends to "come crumbling down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This process of identifying and dismantling the core samskara can be deeply emotional and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

> "When you guys have a problem, and you kind of find the middle of it, right, like you find that core and you discover it and start working on it, all the other crap will come crumbling down." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

However, it's important to set realistic expectations for [[therapeutic_and_emotional_processing_strategies | emotional processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. While significant breakthroughs can occur, especially for individuals who have already engaged in years of self-improvement work and therapy, results are not always immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The key is to show up and give one's best effort, and allow the process to unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

A recent [[metaanalysis on autism and gender identity | meta-analysis]] published in March 2022 by Khalid Sunaki and others examined the relationship between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and gender identity issues. This paper synthesizes a growing body of research, revealing a significant [[link between autism and gender identity | strong link]] between the two conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. One prominent theory explaining this connection involves challenges with mentalization in individuals with autism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## What is Mentalization?

Mentalization is the human capacity to understand what is in the mind of someone who performs an action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This applies not only to the actions of others but also to one's own actions and internal thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. For example, if someone gives a birthday present or a valentine, mentalizing allows one to understand the meaning behind their actions and what might be going on in their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Mentalization Challenges in Autism Spectrum Disorder

Individuals with [[link between autism and gender identity | Autism Spectrum Disorder]] often experience difficulties with mentalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This challenge extends to understanding their own internal environment and how it influences their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This can contribute to social difficulties, as they may not be fully aware of their own feelings or experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Instead of intrinsically understanding social interactions, people with autism may approach them more like mathematical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Mentalization and Gender Identity

Gender identity is largely internally determined, meaning one's sense of their own gender comes from within, despite external physical features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Given this internal nature of gender identity, it logically follows that individuals who struggle with understanding their internal state due to mentalization challenges may also struggle to understand their gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Clinical Implications

The connection between autism and mentalization challenges offers significant [[clinical implications of comorbidity between autism and gender identity | clinical implications]]:

*   **Assessment Recommendations**:
    *   If a patient has autism, clinicians should consider evaluating them for [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
    *   If a patient presents with [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]], they should be evaluated for autism traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
    *   The [[prevalence of gender identity issues in autism spectrum | comorbidity percentages]] are notably high, making this assessment crucial for clinicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Approaches**:
    *   For individuals with autism and [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity variants]], mentalization training may be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This training can help individuals figure out and become more comfortable with their gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, which in turn can resolve confusion and improve social interactions and [[Selfawareness and mental health | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Addressing Underlying Needs**: If a teenager expresses [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]], even if initially perceived as "making it up," it's important to explore the psychological needs being met by such expressions rather than dismiss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Providing support can help them reach a healthy conclusion about their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

Understanding the role of mentalization in the context of both autism and gender identity provides a roadmap for clinicians to address complex co-occurring conditions and improve patient well-being, especially considering that both conditions independently increase the risk of mental distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

Dr. K, a psychiatrist who previously studied to become a monk, discusses how to prevent motivation from diminishing, drawing parallels between ancient spiritual practices and modern scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He suggests that introverts naturally possess an advantage in [[strategies_for_cultivating_internal_motivation_and_discipline | cultivating motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Principle of Internal Cultivation

The concept of conserving motivational energy stems from a principle observed in tantric traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Dr. K learned from a tantric Guru that a secret mantra's power diminishes if revealed, but grows internally with continuous chanting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This internal cultivation is believed to lead to both material and spiritual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Dr. K experienced personal success after consistently practicing this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Scientific Basis: Venting and Diminishing Power

This ancient wisdom can be translated into scientific terms by observing how energy is affected by external expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>:

*   **Trauma and Psychotherapy**: In therapy for traumatized individuals, clinically, venting trauma reduces its internal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. When negative emotions are vocalized externally in a non-judgmental space, their power diminishes, ceasing to control the individual's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This is an [[evidence_based_techniques_to_boost_self_control | evidence-based approach of psychotherapy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Mantra as the Opposite**: A mantra, conversely, involves cultivating something positive internally without venting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This compounds positive internal energy, theoretically leading to positive life changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## How Talking Diminishes Motivation

The principle that venting diminishes energy applies directly to motivation:

*   **External Reinforcement**: When people talk about their future plans (e.g., starting a company, becoming a doctor), they often receive positive external reinforcement, such as admiration or congratulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Reinforcing Talk, Not Action**: This positive reinforcement for talking about a goal mistakenly rewards the act of talking rather than the act of doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. It provides a reward without requiring any actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Motivation Leaks Away**: As a result, the motivation to actually follow through with the action begins to "leak away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This is observable in behaviors like excessive "theory crafting" or trash-talking in gaming communities, where those who boast often don't perform as well as those who quietly practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Introvert Advantage**: Introverts, being less inclined to talk about their plans, naturally retain their internal energy, channeling it into action rather than language, which contributes to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Language as a Substitute for Action

Sigmund Freud discovered that language can serve as a substitute for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. This means that speaking about an intention or desire can fulfill the urge to act, drawing from the same underlying pool of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

*   **Shared Energy Pool**: Yogic philosophy also recognized that language and action originate from the same energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This explains why there are often "talkers" and "doers" rather than individuals who excel at both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. For example, professors of entrepreneurship talk about starting companies, while entrepreneurs actually run them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## Practical Tips for Conserving Motivation

To conserve motivational energy and prevent it from leaking away:

1.  **Observe Your Speech**: Pay attention to how often you talk about what you *want* to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. The more you talk, the less likely you are to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Reflect on Past Actions**: Consider how much you discussed past successful endeavors before doing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Often, there's an inverse correlation: you just started doing it, rather than talking about it extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
3.  **"Shut the Hell Up"**: Especially on social media, avoid posting about your hopes and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
    *   If you have a specific goal, do not tell anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Keep that energy internalized to let it compound and build up pressure, which can then be channeled into action instead of words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
4.  **Journaling with Intent**: If you journal about positive aspirations, make sure to read it again to re-internalize that energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Journaling for negative emotions is about venting them out; for positive, it's about drawing them back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
5.  **Intentional Communication**: When you must talk about a goal, be highly intentional about the scope and length of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. View every word as depleting your motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. Only engage in conversations where the benefit clearly outweighs the cost of venting motivational energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

By keeping positive motivations internal, allowing them to build up, and channeling that pressure into action rather than words, individuals can significantly enhance their ability to accomplish goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

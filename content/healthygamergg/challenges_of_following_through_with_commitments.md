Following through with commitments can be difficult for many people, often leading to a "graveyard" of unfinished projects and abandoned hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While some individuals are highly disciplined and utilize willpower to stick with tasks consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, others struggle with an initial burst of excitement that inevitably wanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Problem with Willpower

Many people attempt to overcome a lack of desire by engaging in a "war with their mind" using willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, this approach is often unsustainable; the number of days one can force themselves to do something declines over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The core issue is not understanding how the mind works and attempting to overcome its natural tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## How the Mind Works

The mind has two key tendencies that impact the ability to follow through:

1.  **Curiosity and Engagement with New Things**
    The mind is inherently curious and enjoys engaging with new stimuli, whether it's a new TV show, learning an instrument, or a new hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This engagement often triggers a dopamine release, making new activities exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
2.  **Development of Tolerance to Stimuli**
    The mind develops tolerance to any kind of stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This is evident in everyday experiences, like no longer noticing the feeling of a shirt after putting it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, or the initial strong smell in a public restroom becoming tolerable over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This tolerance also applies to enjoyable activities, as the pleasure from a piece of cake or playing a video game declines with continued exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### The Real [[Challenges of developing discipline | Challenge]]

The difficulty in following through is not that staying on task is inherently hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Rather, the mind develops tolerance to the current activity and then actively *craves* a different one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This craving for alternative, often more immediately gratifying, activities (e.g., watching TV, social media, texting, video games, pornography) makes it hard to continue with the intended task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The problem of [[Overcoming self sabotage | self-sabotage]] is directly tied to the mind's difficulty with following through, which stems from these cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Urge Surfing: A Technique for Following Through

Instead of fighting the mind's natural tendencies, the technique of **Urge Surfing** utilizes them to promote follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This evidence-based technique is used in addiction psychiatry to help individuals withstand cravings for substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The principle of urge surfing is that urges or cravings arise, but if tolerated for a period of time, they will eventually dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The mind naturally develops tolerance even to its own cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Applying Urge Surfing to Follow-Through

When struggling to follow through, the desire to switch tasks or engage in something else is a craving in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. To apply urge surfing:
1.  **Notice the Urge:** Become aware of the desire to switch activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The mind may present dialogue like, "This is boring," "It's a waste of time," or "We'll do it tomorrow," but underneath this is a craving for dopamine from a different activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
2.  **Surf on Top of It:** Acknowledge the craving but do not give in to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Since no feelings or cravings last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, the mind will eventually get bored of wanting something else and naturally return to the task at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

> "Paradoxically, the best way to follow through if you have if you struggle with like willpower discipline have low conscientiousness is to just surf on top of the urge just sort of tolerate that craving and then kind of return back to the task." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>

### Addressing Objections and Building the Skill

Some common objections to urge surfing include the belief that one's cravings are too powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. However, this thought itself is the mind resisting a technique that could work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Urge surfing is a skill that can be built over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It's not necessary to start with the most powerful cravings; begin with smaller, more manageable urges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

For instance, simply staying focused on a video, despite urges to switch off or check a phone, is an example of successfully urge surfing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. By recognizing how one naturally tolerates these smaller urges, the same principles can be applied to other areas of life to improve [[challenges_of_developing_discipline | discipline]] and follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

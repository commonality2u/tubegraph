Modern parenting, particularly in the digital age, presents unique challenges in maintaining open communication and strong relationships with children. The rise of technology and increased screen time, exacerbated by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to a noticeable [[importance_of_communication_between_parents_and_children | disconnect between parents and their children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## The Challenge of Modern Parenting

Parents often face a dilemma where they want to support their children, but their attempts to guide them are met with resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. For instance, a 14-year-old son significantly increased his screen time on computers, Xbox, and phones [[challenges_of_parenting_during_the_pandemic | since the pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This shift broke previous rules regarding screen limits, leading to what felt like an "addiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The parent's concerns extend to academics and overall well-being, as the child's excessive screen use displaces other activities like exercise, chores, or hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Attempts to encourage these activities often result in arguments or the parent resorting to "tough love" by disabling internet access or pausing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. While parents may feel bad about these actions, they believe it's their [[managing_parental_support | responsibility to help their child understand time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

## Understanding Communication Dynamics

A key issue identified in [[healthy_communication_in_relationships | parent-child communication]] is the way commands are phrased. Parents may issue orders while intending them as requests or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and resentment, as the child perceives a lack of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

For instance, a parent might ask, "Please do your homework," but expect it to be an undeniable order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. From the child's perspective, a "please" implies an option to refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. When parents express unhappiness or disapproval through tone or facial expression, even after the child complies, the child feels it, hindering positive emotional reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

Another common pitfall is asking a question that isn't truly seeking understanding, but rather making a point or accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. If a child's response or opinion is immediately met with "that's wrong," they will naturally become less communicative and provide short, defensive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

## Core Strategies for Parents

To foster [[trust_and_relationship_dynamics | trust and understanding]] and encourage positive behavior, parents can adopt several strategies:

### Shift from Teaching to Understanding
Instead of constantly teaching or lecturing, parents should strive to bring their child to a point of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. This involves asking questions to uncover the child's perspective, rather than immediately correcting or explaining again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. Understanding *how* the child arrives at a "wrong" conclusion is crucial to guiding them toward a "right" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

### Ask Genuine Questions
Focus on asking questions to which you genuinely don't know the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. For example, instead of "Why don't you do your homework?", try:
*   "Do you want me to force you to do your homework?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>
*   "Why is school important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>
*   "Help me understand why you resist me so much, because these things seem important to you and you enjoy them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>

These open-ended questions can reveal underlying motivations or issues, such as difficulties at school (e.g., bullying, ADHD, lack of challenge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

### Avoid Accusations
When a child expresses an opinion, avoid responding with "that's wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. Instead, maintain a curious stance. If the child says school is important, don't immediately follow with "then why don't you...?" This comes across as an accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a> and shuts down the conversation.

### Recruit Your Child as an Ally
Frame challenges as problems to be solved *together* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. Explain your perspective and situation without telling them what's right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. For example:
> "I'd like to support you in these things, I'd like to help you get into a good college, but when I try to do that, you seem to fight me, and then I get stuck. What do you think I should do about that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>

This approach shifts the dynamic from a power struggle to a collaborative effort, fostering [[understanding_and_changing_relationship_patterns | deeper understanding]] and shared responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.

## Parental Support and Alliance Building

A dedicated program, such as Healthy Gamer's parent program, focuses on equipping parents with these sophisticated [[strategies_for_maintaining_a_healthy_relationship_with_someone_with_bpd | communication strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. The program emphasizes:
*   **Communication and Alliance Building:** Learning how to effectively communicate and build an alliance with your child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. By understanding what motivates and matters to the child, parents can frame boundaries and support in a way that aligns with the child's own goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.
*   **Setting Effective Boundaries:** Collaborating with the child to set boundaries, giving them a voice in the process, similar to "no taxation without representation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.
*   **Processing Parental Emotions:** Providing a space for parents to decompress their own emotions, such as fear and frustration, so these do not negatively impact interactions with their child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This allows parents to be calm, collected, and disciplined in their communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

Children learn communication styles from their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. When parents actively express interest in [[empathy_and_understanding_in_forming_relationships | understanding their child's viewpoint]], children are more likely to reciprocate this interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. By guiding children with questions rather than simply providing answers, parents can help their children bring their own understanding to the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>, thereby strengthening the relationship and fostering genuine [[strategies_for_supporting_gifted_children | growth and self-management]].

The concept of self-worth, particularly how it is shaped by external influences, is a recurring theme in personal development. For streamer Felix, his [[struggles_with_selfworth_and_selfesteem | struggles with self-worth and self-esteem]] manifest as [[societal_pressures_and_its_impact_on_selfworth | self-sabotage]] and [[societal_pressures_and_its_impact_on_selfworth | imposter syndrome]], stemming from a perceived need to constantly prove his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## The Need to Prove Worth
Felix describes a pattern where he feels the need to intentionally fail or "lose that rank" in games just so he can "get it back" and feel like he "deserve[s] it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This behavior, which he applies to "almost everything" he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, is driven by a deep-seated belief that "getting there once isn't enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. He explains that if he performs poorly, he would purposefully lose viewers to create a challenge for himself to "get this back" and then feel he "deserve[s] their eyes and their presence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This is a form of [[building_selfworth_and_battling_negative_selfbeliefs | self-sabotage]] designed to create a path to re-earning validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

This pattern suggests that Felix's [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | intrinsic sense of value]] is not internally derived; instead, it is heavily dependent on external validation and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. He feels uncomfortable when people like him or support him unconditionally, especially when he believes his performance doesn't warrant it, because it is "not consistent with the way that you see yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

## Parental Influence on Self-Worth
The origins of this performance-based self-worth are explored, pointing to Felix's childhood and upbringing. The belief that his "value as a human being depends on performance" was taught to him by his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

### The Father's Conditional Pride
Felix recounts how his father consistently pushed him to compete, even in sports he didn't enjoy, such as competitive skiing and biking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Winning these competitions would make his father "super proud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. This created a "double win" dynamic where Felix won for himself and for his father's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

However, a pivotal moment illustrating this conditional pride was when Felix shared his streaming success with his dad, excitedly announcing he had reached over 200 subscribers. His father's dismissive response, "when does that make you go back to school?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>, was crushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. This experience reinforced the idea that his achievements were only valued if they aligned with his father's specific expectations, which were centered on traditional success like schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>.

This interaction fundamentally devalued Felix's intrinsic worth, pushing his [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | sense of self-value]] lower and creating a "gap" that he felt needed to be filled with external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This established a pattern where Felix is "a bike with a broken chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>, despite being inherently capable, needing to constantly overcome perceived deficiencies. This is a clear example of [[the_influence_of_external_expectations_on_personal_desires | the influence of external expectations on personal desires]] and the [[the_impact_of_social_expectations_and_obligations | impact of social expectations and obligations]].

### The Mother's Unconditional Love
In contrast, Felix describes his mother as "not as intense" and always supportive, regardless of his performance. When asked if his mom was proud of him, he could simply say "yeah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. This suggests his mother's love was unconditional, providing a different foundation than his father's more conditional pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Pathways to Healing and Self-Worth
Recognizing the deep impact of [[impact_of_childhood_and_upbringing_on_mental_health_and_behaviors | childhood and upbringing on mental health and behaviors]], the conversation highlights three key areas for Felix to address his self-worth challenges and his tendency to self-sabotage:

1.  **Understand and Analyze Personal Systems:** Felix has developed complex internal systems to cope with his perceived lack of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. Continuing to analyze these systems is crucial.
2.  **Address Paternal Relationship:** Felix needs to confront his feelings about his father's perceived lack of pride and engage in a conversation about their differing definitions of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. This process of [[dealing_with_parental_disapproval | dealing with parental disapproval]] is essential for him to separate his own value from his father's expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>.
    > "Why can't he accept your success for what it is? Why does it have to look like his success?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>
3.  **Connect with Emotions:** Felix exhibits alexithymia, a difficulty in identifying and expressing emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>. He tends to intellectualize feelings, describing them in cerebral or physical terms (e.g., "crushing" instead of "hurt") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. Developing emotional awareness is vital to break negative thought patterns and prevent anger from manifesting as destructive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:24">[01:39:24]</a>.

By addressing these points, Felix can work towards a life where his self-worth is not contingent on external validation, allowing him to pursue his passions (like gaming) for the sheer joy of excelling, rather than as a means to prove his worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. This journey is crucial for [[building_selfworth_and_battling_negative_selfbeliefs | building self-worth]] and breaking free from the "broken chain" of conditional value.

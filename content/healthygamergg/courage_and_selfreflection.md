## Initial Nervousness and Self-Perception
Yvonne expresses nervousness about talking in general, finding it hard to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. She is unsure what the conversation will be about and worries about saying the wrong thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. She feels that people have expectations of her host's communication abilities, which could lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Yvonne identifies with [[impostor_syndrome | impostor syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. She tends to attribute her successes to others, particularly those she is surrounded by, feeling that they "carry" her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. She likens herself to a "support" character in a game, trying to be there for everyone and make them happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This self-perception leads her to feel minimal happiness or credit when her channel is praised, believing it's due to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. She has felt this way for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Prior to streaming, Yvonne simply played games and didn't have numbers to measure success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. While numbers are important in her industry, she places more emphasis on her own happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, prioritizing enjoying what she does and playing games with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Current Challenges and the Pursuit of Independence
Yvonne describes her current life as "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, feeling overwhelmed by events on social media and a turbulent recent breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. She compares her situation to a disastrous game where "every lane is falling apart" and she, as a support, tries to fix things one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This demonstrates a resilient quality, as most people would crumble under such pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Regarding her self-perception, Yvonne admits she doesn't know how she views herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, only that she sees herself as "less than what other people see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. She struggles to accept appreciation, having a "high evasion rate" for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, instantly rejecting compliments because they don't fit her self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Yvonne's desire for independence stems from being in relationships since age 16, never having the chance to be on her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This unexperienced independence felt like a "missing puzzle piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. She describes her early 20s as a time for "finding yourself or like exploring or like experiencing things that help you grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, and she felt she missed out on this due to always being in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. Her most recent boyfriend was "so good" and supportive, giving her freedom, but the lack of solo experience persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

## Reflections on Breakup and "Selfishness"
Yvonne initiated the breakup to avoid a life of regret, specifically regretting not knowing what independence feels like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. She acknowledges the value of the relationship and her ex-boyfriend, which made the decision very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

The breakup caused widespread sadness among friends and family, making Yvonne feel like "negative energy" for two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. As someone who is normally stable and content, this negative period was uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. She feels "selfish" because her ex-boyfriend didn't want to break up and she believes he might wait for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

Dr. K posits that her action was indeed selfish, but clarifies that it's "completely okay" to put oneself first intentionally and with awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. He emphasizes that relationships are often unfair, and it's acceptable to end one that isn't working for you, even if it hurts the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. Yvonne agrees, stating she would have been dishonest if she had stayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

## Sexual Harassment, Freezing, and the Burden of Silence
Yvonne reveals that current social media discussions about sexual harassment and assault have resurfaced minimized past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. In these situations, she "froze" and didn't know how to prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. She recounts two incidents:
1.  **At a club**: A man she knew of, who was drunk, made a vulgar comment in Chinese about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Later, in a van with her boyfriend (who the man didn't know was her boyfriend), the man put his hand under her crop top and later on her butt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. Yvonne "froze" and didn't know what to do after initially trying to move his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. Days later, he messaged her claiming no memory of the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.
2.  **With a friend**: A trusted male friend, who was drunk, entered her room, lay next to her, held and kissed her hand, and then put his hand inside her t-shirt sleeve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. Again, Yvonne "froze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>. He later claimed no memory of it, but apologized a few weeks later while drunk, acknowledging he "overstepped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. This led Yvonne to believe he lied about forgetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

Yvonne admits she "minimized it a lot" and tried to act like it never happened so she could continue seeing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. She feels upset that the perpetrators "got away with it" and that people don't see them as they truly are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.

## The Nature of Silence and Courage
Yvonne's reluctance to name names or delve deeper into these situations stems from a desire to "protect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. She believes there are "a lot of things" she is protecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a> and that revealing details would lead to "chaos" and the "world burned down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>. This perceived global implication, Yvonne agrees, is an "emotional thought" rather than a logical one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a>. The underlying emotion preventing her from speaking fully is "love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:21">[01:36:21]</a>. She feels a responsibility to protect those she loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>.

Dr. K introduces the concept of *catatonia*, a neurological survival response where a person literally freezes and cannot speak or move when in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:28">[01:32:28]</a>. He suggests Yvonne's "freezing" might be this physiological response, which explains why victims cannot always "just say no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. Yvonne did not blame herself for the incidents, recognizing she was put in unexpected situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.

Dr. K praises Yvonne's courage in sharing her story, stating it is "incredibly authentic" and helps others understand the complexities of such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. He notes that silence is often rooted in a "noble reason," like protection and maintaining stability, rather than just fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>.

## Teaching Boundaries
Dr. K shares a personal anecdote about his wife teaching him to respect his daughter's boundaries regarding physical affection, even for a kiss, to teach her that she is allowed to say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:24">[01:45:24]</a>. This highlights how early life experiences can program responses to boundaries, impacting later abilities to assert oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:36">[01:45:36]</a>.

As a psychiatrist, there is recognition of [[impact_of_nutrition_and_psychoactive_substances_on_mental_balance | medical uses for marijuana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Opioid Addiction Treatment

The most convincing medical application observed is its use in helping individuals with opioid addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While seemingly counterintuitive, it appears effective as it can improve various physiological problems that arise from heavy opiate use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. On balance, this use is considered beneficial, provided it is prescribed appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## How Marijuana Interacts with the Brain

Marijuana primarily affects the brain by acting on anandamide receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The term "anandamide" was coined by an Indian individual, named after the Sanskrit word for bliss, reflecting the idea of "bliss receptors" in the brain that marijuana targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The [[cannabinoid_system_and_habit_circuits_in_the_brain | cannabinoid system]] in the brain is intricately involved in [[marijuanas_effect_on_habit_formation_and_motivation | habit formation and motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Initially, the dopamine system reinforces new behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, once a habit is formed, the primary neurotransmitter shifts from dopamine to cannabinoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This means that behaviors, like playing a video game, might start as fun and dopaminergic, but over time, as less dopamine is released, they cross a threshold where the activity is no longer enjoyable, yet the individual continues to engage in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This shift signifies a move from a reward-driven circuit to a habituated or "autopilot" circuit, which does not provide intrinsic reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Habits are governed by these different brain circuits than the dopamine system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Reward vs. Habit Circuits
> The brain operates with two distinct circuits:
> *   **Reward Circuit:** Releases dopamine, leading to pleasure and reinforcing behaviors, like enjoying an iced coffee for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
> *   **Habit Circuit:** A separate circuit takes over when behaviors become habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Once a behavior is a habit, it no longer provides a reward, but the individual is still compelled to do it, even without enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The primary neurotransmitter in the habit circuit is an endocannabinoid, an internal cannabis-like compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Challenges with Marijuana Use and Habits

Clinically, it has been observed that marijuana use can make it difficult for individuals to break habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. People using pot tend to fall into "bad habits" more easily, and it becomes very hard to break free from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. If individuals achieve sobriety from marijuana, their ability to change habits significantly improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This difficulty in making changes is suspected to be related to marijuana's interaction with the [[cannabinoid_system_and_habit_circuits_in_the_brain | cannabinoid receptors]] involved in [[marijuanas_effect_on_habit_formation_and_motivation | habit formation]] and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Individualized Medical Advice

For medical cannabis users, it is crucial to consult a doctor to discuss the risks and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Decisions regarding medical cannabis are highly [[individual_variability_in_marijuana_effects | individualized]], as the effects of marijuana are filtered through a person's unique physiology, including their receptors, metabolism, and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Consequently, the same compound can act slightly differently in various people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This [[individual_variability_in_marijuana_effects | variability]] is why there is no one-size-fits-all solution in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

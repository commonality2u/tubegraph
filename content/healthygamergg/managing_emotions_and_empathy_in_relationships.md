## The Nature of a Giver: Shakti and Emotional Absorption

Some individuals possess a profound capacity for giving, characterized by a benevolent energy often likened to "Shakti" in Hindu tradition, which is a Sanskrit word for energy and also for goddess [01:16:19]. This energy is described as a feminine quality, associated with maternal figures who radiate and give energy to others [01:16:57]. People are often drawn to these "givers" because they are open and provide energy freely in a world where it is not often given [01:18:29].

Such individuals tend to be very empathetic, absorbing the hurt and negativity of others, much like a sponge absorbs water [01:55:00]. This characteristic can make them a positive influence in relationships and families, as they can absorb others' pain [01:55:42]. However, this also means they are highly sensitive to negativity and can become drained or "sucked dry" by those who are "hungry" for their energy [01:56:50].

## Challenges in Relationships for Givers

Individuals with a giving nature, especially those in open or polyamorous relationships, may face significant challenges, including feelings of unfairness and disappointment [02:59:58]. They may find that while they are open and generous, others they invite into their relationships are not as open and may even exhibit possessiveness or jealousy [02:30:08]. This can manifest as hostile actions, such as shutting doors in faces or attempting to sabotage the relationship [02:11:16]. Such experiences can lead to a negative view of people and a fear of meeting new individuals [03:41:20].

A common issue for "givers" is that their relationships can become one-sided, where they are constantly giving without receiving equivalent emotional support or consideration [02:08:11]. This imbalance can lead to feeling used and a sense of losing hope in people [02:05:05].

### Trust Issues and Disappointment

Frequent negative experiences can lead to [[managing_anxiety_and_emotional_needs_in_relationships | trust issues and a feeling of being disappointed]] [02:00:23]. This can be particularly impactful for someone who previously viewed people with a lot of positivity [04:07:04]. The emotional toll can be significant, leading to feelings of being tired and deeply affected [03:57:02].

## Childhood Roots of Giving Tendencies

The tendency to constantly give and prioritize others' happiness can often be rooted in childhood experiences. In some cases, a child might feel responsible for their parent's emotional well-being, becoming a "therapist" from a very young age [01:00:47]. This can lead to suppressing one's own negative feelings and focusing solely on making others happy [01:06:05]. If both parents are emotionally unavailable or respond negatively to a child's expressions of distress, the child learns to be "happy" on the outside, pushing sad feelings inward [01:07:01]. This dynamic fosters a reflexive tendency to prioritize others' needs and happiness, even at personal cost [01:07:30]. This relates to the [[role_of_empathy_and_emotional_intelligence | role of empathy and emotional intelligence]] in shaping relationship patterns.

## Strategies for Managing Emotional Overload

To prevent burnout and persistent hurt, individuals with a strong giving nature need to learn to manage their emotional boundaries and practice self-care.

### Understanding Monogamy vs. Polyamory

A common misconception is that monogamous relationships are about controlling a partner's feelings [03:00:54]. However, a healthy monogamous relationship is based on a mutual choice to engage romantically and sexually only with each other, respecting that feelings for others are normal but actions are controlled [03:07:07]. In contrast, polyamorous relationships, while allowing multiple connections, may statistically expose individuals to more potential drama due to a larger number of interactions [04:00:50].

### Prioritizing Self and Setting Boundaries

A key [[techniques_for_developing_emotional_resolve | technique for developing emotional resolve]] is to challenge the belief that prioritizing oneself is inherently selfish or neglectful of others [01:55:53]. It's crucial to understand that taking care of oneself is not synonymous with neglecting loved ones; there is a wide middle ground for self-prioritization without being neglectful [01:56:36].

*   **Communication:** Have open conversations with those who rely on you, explaining that you are going through personal development and may be less available than before [01:57:36].
*   **Scheduling:** Implement formal structures like scheduling calls or meetings with friends or family members to ensure support is given mindfully rather than reflexively [02:00:28]. This allows for a conscious allocation of emotional "mana" [01:59:40].
*   **Self-Reflection:** Take time for oneself, even if it feels "guilty" or "wasteful," to figure out personal goals and needs, rather than only focusing on others [01:59:14].

### [[therapeutic_and_emotional_processing_strategies | Therapeutic and Emotional Processing Strategies]]

Empathic individuals need ways to "wring out" the emotions they absorb from others [01:50:07]. These include:
*   **Social Support:** Leaning on friends, family, or other emotional supports to process feelings without acting on them directly with the person causing the pain [01:51:14].
*   **Mind-Body Practices:** Engaging in practices like meditation or yoga to develop the capacity to tolerate painful emotions until they can be processed and released [01:53:07].
*   **Confronting Internal Conflict:** Recognizing the internal conflict between wanting to make others happy and neglecting oneself [01:35:53]. The feeling of "not being in the picture" for oneself needs to be acknowledged and integrated [01:36:02].
*   **Self-Love:** Deliberately turning the unconditional love and care usually directed outward towards oneself [01:41:20].

Individuals must learn when to give and when not to give, ensuring that their generosity is under their own control, not dictated by others' demands [01:22:07]. Ignoring this can lead to ongoing suffering and pain [01:22:19].

## The Path to a Happy Life

The journey involves recognizing deeply ingrained patterns of self-neglect, often stemming from childhood experiences [01:39:18]. The goal is to integrate the parts of oneself that give freely with the parts that have been neglected, allowing both to coexist peacefully [01:40:08]. This leads to a more fulfilling and less painful existence, balancing the desire to make the world a better place with the necessity of self-care and self-respect [01:43:50].

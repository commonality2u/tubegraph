Men often display [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | reluctance to engage in couples counseling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This reluctance is not typically due to an avoidance of the problem or putting their head in the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Instead, research indicates men often feel "outgunned" in a therapy setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Reasons for Reluctance

*   **Communication Style Disparity** Men often feel their partner is much better at understanding and articulating their feelings, which allows them to "make their case better" in counseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. When a therapist asks a man how he feels, he may frequently respond with "I don't know" or "I'm not sure," feeling unable to effectively communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Social Norms** The way men are raised often teaches them to view emotions as problems to be solved rather than something to be talked about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, if a boy is bullied and feels ashamed, articulating those feelings might lead to worse treatment; instead, he is taught to fix the problem physically (e.g., lose weight, learn martial arts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the talk-based approach of traditional psychotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Perceived Imbalance in Emotional Literacy** Men may feel like they are "playing basketball" but don't "know how to dribble" when asked to articulate emotions in therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This can lead to feeling like an "idiot" because they are expected to know what they feel but cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **[[systemic_biases_in_therapy_for_men | Systemic Biases in Therapy]]** The historical development of psychotherapy has largely catered to women, who constitute 60-70% of patients and therapists today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Diagnoses often received by women, like depression and anxiety, are tied to feelings and articulation, while men are more frequently diagnosed with "externalizing disorders" such as addictions or antisocial personality disorder, which involve behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This suggests that when men feel something, they tend to act on it rather than articulate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Analogy of a Court of Law

A man in couples counseling may feel like he's in a court of law where his partner makes an articulate emotional case against him (e.g., "he's neglectful," "he doesn't appreciate me," "I feel underappreciated") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The man, however, "doesn't speak the language of emotions" and struggles to respond effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## How Men Communicate Emotions

Men often communicate emotions in ways that are not typically understood by conventional psychotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. An example is the "negative expression of a positive affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. When proud of a friend, men might "dog" or insult them (e.g., "brah GG Noob," "you're whipped") while smiling, rather than expressing direct appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This indirect, often physical, mode of expression is antithetical to the direct, verbal articulation encouraged in therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Men also tend to describe emotional pain physically, such as "it felt like she ripped my heart out" or "it felt like she stomped on my balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This physical language is understood by other men but may not translate well into traditional therapeutic dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Addressing Reluctance in Therapy

Despite these challenges, psychotherapy remains an evidence-based and effective treatment for mental illness for both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. To improve the experience for men, specific strategies can be employed:

*   **Seek Multiple Therapists**: It is recommended to try at least three different psychotherapists to find a good "fit," as communication styles vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Communicate Your Needs**:
    *   Inform the therapist upfront about difficulty articulating feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
    *   Mention concern about [[relationship_challenges_stemming_from_alexithymia | normative male alexithymia]], which is the idea that most men are "colorblind" to their internal emotional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
    *   Ask the therapist to adjust their style to be more active or offer more guidance instead of relying solely on open-ended questions like "How do you feel?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   If therapy is not working after a few sessions, express this directly and ask for a recommendation for a different therapist who might be a better fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This does not imply the therapist is "not good," but rather that the fit is not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Consider Physical Approaches**: Recognizing that emotions are very physiological for men, incorporating bodily work can be highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Activities like Tai Chi and yoga are shown to be effective for mood and anxiety disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. [[alternative_and_somatic_therapies_for_men | Somatic therapies]] (e.g., EMDR, EFT/tapping), which integrate the body, are also gaining interest and evidence of effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Ultimately, men entering therapy should understand that the default approach may not be perfectly suited to them, and they should feel empowered to ask for adjustments or seek a different fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Dr. K's coaching program, which was set to release on September 4th, aims to open up more spots for coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Coaches: Training and Role

The coaches in the program are individuals from the community who have been personally trained by Dr. K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Their purpose is to help people within the community, acting as an attempt to duplicate Dr. K's methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While they are not Dr. K, they are noted for being "pretty effective" at helping individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Coaches are described as passionate, committed, and intelligent individuals who have undergone a period of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Dr. K works with all coaches on an ongoing basis, providing supervision and continuing education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. If a coach encounters an issue with a client, Dr. K offers advice or helps them figure out how to assist the client in moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Coaches are compensated for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Program Effectiveness and Scope

The coaching program emphasizes an evidence-based approach, collecting outcomes and measuring the effectiveness of the coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The coaches have shown to be "pretty good" based on these measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Coaches are there to help people overcome issues commonly discussed in streams, such as understanding relationships, gaining self-understanding, and managing procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Limitations

It is important to note that the coaching provided is not a medical treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Coaches are not authorized to diagnose or treat medical conditions like depression or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While clients can discuss feelings of anxiety, the role is not for diagnosis or treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The concept of "brain rot" describes a state where the mind becomes deconditioned or "rusted," leading to symptoms like lethargy, difficulty focusing, and a lack of motivation or direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. A significant factor contributing to [[understanding_brain_rot_and_its_effects | brain rot]] is the "colonization" of the mind, where particular thoughts begin to dominate and interfere with intended actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56">[03:56]</a>.

## How the Mind Becomes Colonized

The operating principle of the mind dictates that sensory inputs determine which thoughts arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46">[12:46]</a>. This mechanism is well understood in fields like game development, where heavy advertising and sponsored streams before a game's release serve to bombard individuals with sensory input, populating their minds with thoughts about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51">[12:51]</a>. This intense colonization leads to actions like pre-ordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38">[13:38]</a>.

For individuals experiencing [[understanding_brain_rot_and_its_effects | brain rot]], their minds are often colonized by a variety of thoughts, making even simple tasks ten times harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46">[13:46]</a>. For instance, an attempt to study might be interrupted by thoughts of video games or movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05">[14:05]</a>. Negative influences, such as toxic conversations, can also colonize the mind, requiring constant mental effort to overcome their impact when trying to engage in productive activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19">[14:19]</a>.

## Modern Society's Invasive Colonization

Modern society contributes significantly to the rise of [[understanding_brain_rot_and_its_effects | brain rot]] through its pervasively colonizing nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22">[15:22]</a>. Constant notifications from applications, text messages, and emails continuously invade the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30">[15:30]</a>. This constant bombardment exacerbates [[understanding_brain_rot_and_its_effects | brain rot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05">[16:05]</a>.

Many individuals with [[understanding_brain_rot_and_its_effects | brain rot]] report spending their days engaged in activities that heavily colonize their minds, such as binge-watching YouTube, consuming Twitch streams, or playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11">[16:11]</a>. The continuous exposure to these activities, even while performing other tasks like eating or cleaning, deeply embeds related thoughts, making it challenging to focus on other objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19">[16:19]</a>.

## Decolonizing the Mind: A Yogic Approach

Yogis, who aim to optimize mental function, are skilled at preventing colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42">[14:42]</a>. They often reside in secluded environments, like caves in the Himalayas, to minimize external sensory input and achieve a state free from distracting thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47">[14:47]</a>. This intentional reduction of [[impact_of_technology_and_external_stimuli | external stimuli]] allows the mind to "clean itself out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17">[17:17]</a>.

To reverse [[understanding_brain_rot_and_its_effects | brain rot]], it is crucial to control what colonizes the mind by restricting sensory inputs as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57">[26:57]</a>. This does not necessarily mean ceasing all [[impact_of_technology_and_external_stimuli | technology and external stimuli]] use, but rather consciously limiting exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57">[15:57]</a>. Even small changes, such as eating without watching streams or listening to music instead of podcasts related to distracting topics, can reduce the "bacterial load" on the mind, making it easier to pursue desired tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38">[16:38]</a>. Starting with short periods of being completely unplugged, such as a five-minute walk, can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12">[27:12]</a>. Additionally, actively seeking to colonize the mind with positive influences, such as joining communities that promote entrepreneurship, can aid in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25">[27:25]</a>.

When addressing personal problems, focusing on the core issue can lead to other difficulties crumbling away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach is central to both coaching and therapy in fostering [[Personal growth and selfawareness | personal growth]].

## Understanding Core Beliefs and Behavioral Cycles

An individual grappling with social anxiety described feeling like they have "no personality" and are "hollow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This feeling leads to a fear of talking to people, both in reality and online, due to a belief of being "too boring" and having "nothing of value to offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

This core belief, summarized as "I am too boring" and "I am not valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, drives a specific behavioral pattern:
1.  **Building Courage**: Sometimes, the individual musters courage to message or respond to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
2.  **Ghosting**: This courage fades, leading to ghosting for weeks to avoid conversations where others might "realize I am boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
3.  **Self-Reinforcement**: The act of ghosting leads to feelings of guilt and inadequacy ("I'm so pathetic"), which reinforces the core belief of being invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

This cycle is protected by rationalizations like, "my close friends are too close to realize how pathetic I am," which is a defensive fear rather than a logical conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The mind employs these thoughts to "protect against rejection" and avoid the negative feelings associated with the ghosting cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The "Sum Squad"
> The entire complex of thoughts, fears, and behaviors revolves around the core belief of not being valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. As long as this core belief persists, all other issues will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## The Power of Addressing the Root Cause

While it's possible to address symptoms like ghosting, it is an "adaptation of an adaptation" and far from the root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The most effective approach is to target the core belief directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The fundamental question to explore is: "Where did you learn that you're not valuable?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This also extends to the belief that others are "better than you" or on a "different level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Dismantling this core belief, which is tied to one's [[Personal Growth and Selfacceptance | identity]] and "ahamkar" (ego/sense of self), can cause the entire complex of associated problems to "crumble down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Coaching's Role in Uncovering Deep-Seated Issues

A real-world example illustrates how coaching can facilitate this process. A person with years of [[Personal growth and selfawareness | self-awareness]] from [[Therapy versus coaching for achieving relational and personal goals | therapy]] and [[Personal growth and selfawareness | self-improvement]] work initially felt they already knew everything about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. They recognized their "self-value problems" and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Despite their initial skepticism and intent to end coaching, a session involved "seemingly basic questions" and reflections from the coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This led to an unexpected "intense samskara" (a deep-seated impression or pattern) being accessed, causing an emotional breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This breakthrough, where the "samskara" and its origin were identified, demonstrated that once a core issue is hit, "stuff starts crumbling down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Setting Realistic Expectations for Coaching

While the described coaching experience might seem like an immediate, profound breakthrough, it's crucial to set realistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The individual in the anecdote had already engaged in "self-improvement work and therapy and stuff for years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This suggests that the core issue was "right under the surface" and "ready to come out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Therefore, while coaching can be transformative, not every experience will result in such immediate emotional catharsis, especially within just a couple of sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The key is to show up and do your best, understanding that progress can be cumulative and may require prior [[Therapy versus coaching for achieving relational and personal goals | therapy]] or [[Personal growth and selfawareness | self-improvement]] efforts to prepare the ground for deeper insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

While marijuana has recognized [[medical_uses_for_marijuana | medical uses]], such as helping individuals with opioid addiction, its impact on brain circuits related to habit formation and motivation is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It's important to note that while medical marijuana can be beneficial, it should always be prescribed and considered on an individual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## How Marijuana Works in the Brain

Marijuana primarily interacts with anandamide receptors in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The term "anandamide" is derived from the Sanskrit word for "bliss," reflecting its role in the brain's "bliss receptors" that marijuana acts upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Contrary to the common belief that marijuana solely makes people "stupider," its effects are considered more "insidious" due to its influence on [[cannabinoid_system_and_habit_circuits_in_the_brain | habit formation]] and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Role of Dopamine and Cannabinoids in Habit Formation

The brain operates with two distinct circuits that govern behavior: a reward circuit and a habit circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Reward Circuit (Dopamine)
Initially, when a behavior is being reinforced, the [[effects_of_dopamine_on_behavior_and_addiction | dopamine system]] is primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This circuit, involving structures like the nucleus accumbens and mesolimbic system, is dopaminergic and responsible for pleasure and behavioral reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For example, the first time someone plays a video game, they experience pleasure and [[effects_of_dopamine_and_adenosine_on_motivation | dopamine]] release, motivating them to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Habit Circuit (Cannabinoids)
Once a habit is formed, the primary neurotransmitter shifts from [[effects_of_dopamine_on_behavior_and_addiction | dopamine]] to cannabinoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This means the behavior moves from a reward circuit to a "habituated" or "autopilot" circuit, which is governed by different parts of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

In this phase, individuals may continue a behavior (like playing video games or brushing teeth) even if they no longer experience pleasure or reward from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This shift is crucial for understanding how habits are formed and maintained, even without ongoing reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Marijuana's Impact on Habit Circuits
Marijuana appears to disrupt the brain's habit circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Clinically, it has been observed that people who use marijuana tend to fall into "weird habitual non-enjoyment" patterns more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. It becomes very difficult for them to break these bad habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

When individuals cease marijuana use, their ability to change habits significantly improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This suggests that marijuana interferes with the brain's capacity for habit modification, likely due to its interaction with [[cannabinoid_system_and_habit_circuits_in_the_brain | cannabinoid receptors]] involved in habit formation and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Individual Variability

It's crucial to understand that the [[individual_variability_in_marijuana_effects | effects of marijuana]] are not uniform across all individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Marijuana acts within an individual's unique body, meaning the effects are filtered through their specific receptors, metabolism, and brain chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This is why a single compound can act slightly differently in different people, and there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Therefore, any concerns about withdrawal symptoms or [[impact_of_nutrition_and_psychoactive_substances_on_mental_balance | substance effects]] should be discussed with a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

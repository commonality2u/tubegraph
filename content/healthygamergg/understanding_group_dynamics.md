Being a "filler friend" describes a situation where an individual feels like a placeholder in social settings, rarely contributing to conversations, and often unnoticed or neglected, even when group plans are made in their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While it's not always intentional, it can be a tricky position because the group may not be actively including the individual, and the individual might also contribute to the dynamic through social anxiety or lack of participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Key Principles in Group Dynamics

The most crucial factor determining who gets invited or included in a group is "perceived interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. When deciding whom to invite, people don't typically consider social status or wealth, but rather how interested someone appears to be in the activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If someone is silent or doesn't contribute to the conversation, their perceived interest in an activity decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

To change the "filler friend" dynamic, focus on what you can control: demonstrating your interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Increasing Perceived Interest Through Participation

Participation is key to showing perceived interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, participation can be tough, often paralyzed by "what ifs" â€“ worries about how others will perceive you if you speak up (e.g., "What if they don't listen?" or "What if they don't think I'm cool?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This lack of participation then reinforces the perception of disinterest, leading to exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### The "One-Two Punch" Technique

To facilitate benign participation, use the "one-two punch" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>:
1.  **Make a Comment:** Offer a reflection or reaction to what the person is saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
2.  **Follow Up with a Question:** Ask an inquiry that resolves ambiguity or digs deeper into the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

**Example:**
*   **Statement:** "I love anime." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   **Comment/Reaction:** "Anime is dope!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   **Question (resolving ambiguity):** "Which anime do you like?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>

This technique helps avoid sounding like an interrogation (which can happen if you only ask questions) while still showing engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Aim to use this method about 15-20% of the time in group conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Handling Specific Situations

#### Not Liking Small Talk
Many people dislike small talk because they don't know how to do it well or find it shallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. However, small talk often serves as the "upper levels of the dialogue tree" to reach deeper connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. You can become skilled at advancing conversations quickly to more interesting topics by using the "one-two punch" to dig into themes or deeper meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The key is to be willing to participate in small talk to form connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

#### Not Relating to the Conversation
If you don't relate to the current conversation, being curious is an effective way to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Ask clarifying questions about the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. People often enjoy explaining their passions to genuinely interested listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

## Directly Asking for Inclusion

A "transformational" but potentially terrifying tip is to directly ask if an invitation is open if you hear a group making plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For example, "Hey, that sounds awesome, is it an open invitation? Is it cool if I come?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

This addresses the "what ifs" directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. If they say no, you have clarity, and if they say yes, you've gained an invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. If concerned about intruding, you can express your interest while also stating you don't want to be a "fifth wheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Post-Invitation Reinforcement
If you are invited, it's crucial to reinforce your perceived interest:
*   **At the start:** "Thanks for inviting me/setting this up, I really appreciate it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>
*   **At the end:** "Hey thanks, I really had a good time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>
*   **Acknowledge your nature:** If you're generally quiet, you can add, "I'm on the quieter side, I hope that's okay." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>
*   **Smile:** Smiling can convey interest and approachability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

It's important to apply these principles appropriately and not in a way that feels intrusive or "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The overall aim is to clearly communicate your interest and engage with others to foster [[Trust and relationship dynamics | deeper connections]].

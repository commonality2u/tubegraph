Pacing, or getting up and walking back and forth, is an "easy" habit that can lead to substantial change in productivity and wellness with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It has been described as having "revolutionized" one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## How to Pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
Pacing involves getting up and walking back and forth several times throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Why Pacing Helps Productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>
Pacing is a [[strategies_for_managing_motivation_and_focus | strategy for managing motivation and focus]] and a [[techniques_for_improving_focus_and_attention | technique for improving focus and attention]]. It offers several benefits:

*   **Avoids Digital Distraction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
    When feeling fatigued or distracted from work, the common response is to engage with a technological device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. These activities are designed to increase engagement, turning a short distraction into an hour-long one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Pacing allows for a break from work without slipping into these time-consuming digital traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

*   **Mental Decompression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>
    Engaging with online content often ramps up one's mental state, especially with inflammatory content, making it harder to refocus on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Pacing, conversely, decompresses the mental state, allowing the mind to wander and process thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This means returning to work in a more relaxed and focused state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

*   **Physical Benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
    Beyond mental benefits, pacing improves physical well-being by:
    *   Getting blood flowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
    *   Improving venous return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
    *   Using muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>
    *   Relieving back pain from prolonged sitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

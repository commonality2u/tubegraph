The ability to effectively learn and internalize information is crucial for academic success. One approach to optimizing this process involves cultivating a calm and focused state of mind, which has been shown to be supported by practices like [[Mindfulness and meditation for controlling attention and selfawareness | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

## The Challenge of Internalizing Information

It is common to read information repeatedly without truly understanding or internalizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The speaker noted a personal quest to understand why sometimes information "sinks in" after a single read, while other times it requires ten reads or more without comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The key difference lies in the state of mind of the learner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:10">[03:08:10]</a>.

## The Role of a Calm Mind

When the mind is agitated or distracted—such as during emotional distress or a chaotic environment—it's difficult for new information to be absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The mind can be visualized as a pool of water with dirt; when the water is turbulent, the dirt is stirred up, obscuring the bottom (representing the subconscious) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. A still mind is necessary for information to sink in deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

A [[Techniques for improving focus and attention | focused]] mind is essential for enacting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This principle applies not only to academic learning but also to internalizing new beliefs and changing [[The impact of meditation on mental clarity and subconscious beliefs | subconscious beliefs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## Personal Application in Medical School

The speaker applied this understanding during medical school. While peers often studied five to eight hours a day, the speaker studied only two hours a day, sometimes more before tests or on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This efficiency was achieved by:
*   Waking up early (between 4:00 and 4:30 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   [[Mindfulness and meditation for controlling attention and selfawareness | Meditating]] and doing yoga in the morning to achieve a super [[Techniques for improving focus and attention | focused]] and clear mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   Studying the day's class material *before* class, turning class into a review session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This made learning easier and more effective, akin to having multiple review sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Scientific Validation

Beyond spiritual or anecdotal claims, there is overwhelming scientific evidence supporting the cognitive benefits of regular [[Mindfulness and meditation for controlling attention and selfawareness | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. Studies indicate that [[Mindfulness and meditation for controlling attention and selfawareness | meditation]] improves:
*   [[strategies_to_improve_attention_and_productivity | Attention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.
*   Concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.
*   Memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

Consequently, it is believed that engaging in regular [[Mindfulness and meditation for controlling attention and selfawareness | meditation]] can lead to an improvement in academic performance, such as a higher GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>.

The concept of [[Selfawareness and mental health | self-awareness]], while often seen as beneficial for [[Personal growth and selfawareness | personal growth and selfawareness]], can also contribute to mental health challenges like depression when it becomes excessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This phenomenon is closely linked to the brain's default mode network.

## The Default Mode Network (DMN)

The default mode network (DMN) is a part of the human brain responsible for our capacity for [[Selfawareness and mental health | self-awareness]] and self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It is a key differentiator between humans and most animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

This network allows for "meta-level thinking" about oneself while navigating the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For example, a deer failing to find food in multiple locations won't experience feelings of inadequacy, but a human experiencing repeated rejections might begin to view themselves as an "idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This ability for self-reflection is profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The DMN is essentially our capacity for [[Building selfawareness for personal growth | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The work of Marcus E. Raichle is referenced in relation to the DMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### DMN and Depression

Evolutionarily, the development of the DMN introduced the possibility of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Research indicates that individuals experiencing depression often have "overly active" default mode networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

When the DMN is hyperactive, even minor situations can lead to disproportionate self-blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This constant internal focus on "I" – where the individual is the object of their own attention – correlates neuroscientifically with depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It can lead to extreme thoughts, such as believing one's family would be "better off without me," even when these thoughts are unrelated to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Psychedelics as Novel Treatments

Novel treatments for depression, such as ketamine and [[Role of Psilocybin in Mental Health Treatment | psilocybin]], appear to work by affecting the DMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Ketamine

Ketamine is a dissociative agent that causes a temporary separation from oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. It is one of the fastest-acting treatments for depression, with improvements potentially seen within hours, unlike SSRIs which can take weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The key neuroscientific effect of ketamine in the brain is that it "shuts off" the default mode network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This allows individuals to stop being "stuck" in self-focused thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Psilocybin and Other Hallucinogens

Substances like [[Role of Psilocybin in Mental Health Treatment | psilocybin]] and MDMA are undergoing trials for depression treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. These hallucinogens can induce a "cosmic sense of connection" and also "shut off" the default mode network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. By fracturing the sense of self, these substances can alleviate the problem of over-[[Selfawareness and mental health | self-awareness]], leading to improvement in depressive symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Important Disclaimer

It is crucial to note that recreational use of substances like ketamine or psilocybin is not recommended due to safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Ketamine is a substance of abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, and both it and other hallucinogens can be dangerous, potentially leading to traumatic experiences or PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. When used for treatment, administration involves purity guarantees and medical supervision by professionals like nurses and physicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

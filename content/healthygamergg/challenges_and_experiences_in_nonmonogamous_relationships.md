[[open_relationships_and_polyamory | Open relationships]] and polyamory are forms of non-monogamous relationships where individuals can engage in romantic and/or sexual connections with multiple people. While the terms are often used interchangeably or are seen as having overlapping meanings, there can be subtle differences in how they are defined or practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Definitions and Distinctions

*   **Open Relationship**: In this context, an open relationship means partners are able to see other people both romantically and sexually outside of their primary relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The term "open" is used when partners might not be living with or currently dating a third person, but maintain the ability to pursue romantic or sexual relationships with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Polyamorous Relationship**: Polyamory often implies the capacity to have feelings for and date multiple individuals at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. While the speaker suggests that "polyamorous" might be used when partners live together with multiple individuals, she ultimately describes her current relationship as "non-monogamous" as a broader term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Non-monogamous**: This is a general term encompassing relationships where individuals can see multiple people simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Reasons for Engaging in Open Relationships

Milena, who is in an open relationship, expresses that a primary reason for her to be in such a relationship is to allow her partner to experience multiple things in life, beyond just her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. She deeply loves her partner and finds happiness in the thought that he can extend that happiness to other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. This perspective highlights a desire to share love and opportunities for connection, seeing it as a beautiful thing without the constraints of traditional monogamy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | Challenges and Experiences]]

Despite the positive intentions, [[open_relationships_and_polyamory | open relationships]] can present unique [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | challenges]].

### Trust Issues and Feeling Used
Milena describes experiencing a significant increase in [[challenges_in_forming_human_connections_and_relationships | trust issues]] over the last year, leading to disappointment and a feeling that people are becoming "really mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. She feels it's hard to trust people, especially when trust is given but not reciprocated, leading to feelings of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. She feels used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, as relationships often become one-sided where she gives a lot, but others act hurtfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

### Jealousy and Sabotage
A significant [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | challenge]] stems from other individuals involved in the open relationship exhibiting jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This jealousy has manifested in mean behavior and attempts to sabotage Milena's primary relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Examples include intentionally trying to make her feel bad or jealous, making fun of her, or implying they are "the one" instead of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This behavior is deeply hurtful because Milena feels she has been generous and done nothing to provoke it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

### Misaligned Expectations
Milena believes that drama is unnecessary in [[open_relationships_and_polyamory | open relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. However, it is suggested that if others seek exclusivity, their actions might not be malicious but rather a consequence of their desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. This highlights a potential mismatch in [[managing_expectations_in_new_relationships | expectations]] between those who embrace non-monogamy and those who might struggle with its implications.

### Emotional Drain
The repeated negative experiences have led Milena to feel tired and emotionally affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. She notices a shift in her perspective, where she now views people negatively and feels scared meeting new people instead of happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. This is attributed to frequent disappointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. There is a fear of changing her perspective on people, potentially becoming less positive or more jaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### Analogy of the Sponge
Milena's experience is likened to that of a sponge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>. She is seen as someone who absorbs the hurt and negativity of others, drawing people to her because she provides comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. While this makes her a wonderful influence, it also means she takes on others' emotional burdens, leading to an emotional drain if she doesn't learn how to "squeeze out the water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:05">[01:50:05]</a>. This pattern of giving and absorbing negativity can be particularly taxing for highly empathic individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Comparison with Monogamy
Milena initially perceives monogamous relationships as controlling, particularly in terms of partners' feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. However, it is countered that healthy monogamy is not about controlling feelings, but about a mutual choice to exclusively engage romantically and sexually with one partner, managing actions rather than emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. This perspective highlights that feelings like romantic or sexual interest in others are normal, but actions based on those feelings are a choice made to support a specific relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

It is suggested that while both monogamous and [[open_relationships_and_polyamory | polyamorous relationships]] can face [[challenges_in_dating_and_relationships | control issues]], polyamorous relationships might statistically face more due to a higher number of people entering and exiting the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

## Personal Sacrifices and Loneliness
Milena acknowledges that she has made significant sacrifices for her relationship, including living away from friends and family in Sweden and New Zealand, and facing professional limitations in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. She feels lonely, as few people understand her experiences or share similar mindsets, making it difficult to vent or connect deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

The intensity of her life, including [[open_relationships_and_polyamory | open relationship]] dynamics and the internet's "drama," is overwhelming, with little time to process new events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>. She feels like she doesn't belong in the "Twitch community" but continues due to her partner being a streamer and her desire to make others happy and inspire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.

Milena's long-standing desire to make others happy, stemming from childhood experiences of feeling responsible for her mother's happiness, has led to a pattern of prioritizing others' well-being over her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. This deep-seated tendency to give, while positive, can lead to personal sacrifice and emotional pain when not balanced with self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

It is suggested that for her to truly find peace, she needs to include herself in the "picture" of her life and practice a degree of self-care or "selfishness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>. This involves recognizing her own needs and communicating them, even if it might cause discomfort to others, rather than always sacrificing her own well-being for the happiness of those around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>.

The increasing prevalence of touch deprivation, often referred to as "touch starvation," is a significant concern in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This struggle, characterized by a lack of physical affection like hugs, is not an isolated experience and affects individuals across all genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Even neurodivergent individuals who may dislike being touched can still experience a deep longing for physical contact, placing them in a particularly challenging situation where their body needs touch but their somatosensory cortex prevents engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Physiological Effects of Touch Deprivation

The absence of physical touch has profound [[physiological_effects_of_touch_deprivation | physiological effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:
*   **Oxytocin**: Physical contact releases oxytocin, known as the bonding hormone. This hormone helps calm the nervous system, reduces stress hormone responses, and fosters loving bonds between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Hugs, therefore, offer a physiological benefit, not just a subjective feeling of well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Historical Studies**: Historically, studies on touch deprivation were conducted on orphans, such as those in Romania, who were physically starved for touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Today, the "average person" serves as a study subject for touch deprivation, indicating it has become a societal norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Health Outcomes**: Lack of touch is associated with negative health outcomes, including changes in cardiovascular health, worsening diabetes (indicated by hemoglobin A1c), increased cortisol levels, and heightened risks of depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Pain Perception**: Studies have shown that human contact, especially from a loved one, can significantly blunt and attenuate the brain's perception and response to pain, making the experience of life literally less painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The rising prevalence of inflammatory issues and health trends like gluten-free or keto diets might be linked to this widespread touch deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Societal Contributors to Touch Deprivation

Several societal factors contribute to the pervasive lack of physical touch:
*   **[[societal_contribution_to_loneliness | Loneliness Epidemic]]**: There is a documented [[societal_contribution_to_loneliness | loneliness epidemic]], with rising rates of mental illness, an astronomical increase in people who have never been in romantic relationships or had sexual relations, and a growing number of individuals with zero friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Independence**: Society has increasingly valued independence—financial and emotional—to the point where interdependence is often viewed as a weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This focus leads individuals to believe they must fix their problems alone, or blame societal structures, thereby absolving themselves of the responsibility to care for other human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Community needs are often outsourced to institutions like governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of technology on social skills | Technology as a Substitute]]**: [[Impact of technology and society on loneliness | Technology]] is increasingly designed to meet human needs without requiring direct human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This includes apps for meeting people, ordering food, or even choosing a "no talk" option in ride-sharing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   Substitutes for human connection include online chat platforms (e.g., Discord) and sending emojis instead of actual hugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   The rise of virtual companions (e.g., virtual girlfriend apps, human-shaped pillows, sexual devices, and even AI like ChatGPT) further illustrates the trend of substituting genuine human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Impact on Human Interaction

The push for independence and the rise of technology have made society uncomfortable with physical touch and even basic verbal interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Asking someone if they need a hug might be perceived negatively, leading to a disconnected society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Professionals, such as psychiatrists, are often advised against touching patients due to ethical considerations and the potential for misinterpretation, even when a patient is distressed and a hug might seem instinctively helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Addressing the Problem

To counter touch deprivation, it's crucial to:
*   **Use Technology as a Tool, Not a Substitute**: Technology can be a tool to fulfill human needs, but it must not be used as a substitute for direct human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Embrace Interdependence**: Instead of solely blaming individuals or society, people must begin accepting responsibility for the needs of those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. While personal sacrifice is not mandated, collective action and a willingness to offer care, even when it might be difficult or painful, are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Lower the Threshold for Human Contact**: The ease with which human contact can be initiated needs to increase. Currently, a person might need to achieve widespread online attention (e.g., a viral TikTok video) just to receive a hug, which represents an unacceptably high hurdle for basic human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

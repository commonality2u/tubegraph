The [[Role of validation in personal growth]] is a complex topic, often explored through the lens of internal versus external sources of self-worth. It highlights how an over-reliance on external validation can lead to self-sabotage and hinder genuine personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of External Validation

### Imposter Syndrome and Self-Sabotage
Individuals who primarily seek external validation may experience [[role_of_selfacceptance_and_selfcriticism_in_personal_growth | imposter syndrome]] and engage in [[role_of_selfacceptance_and_selfcriticism_in_personal_growth | self-sabotage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This often manifests as needing to constantly prove one's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For example, if someone achieves a high rank in a game, they might intentionally perform poorly to lose that rank, only to regain it later to feel like they truly "deserve" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This repetitive cycle, driven by a need to reaffirm worth, can be exhausting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Similarly, in public performances like streaming, a streamer might intentionally "shave off" viewers if they feel they are playing poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This is because they feel uncomfortable if the audience remains when their performance is "trash," as it does not align with their self-perception that their value is solely tied to their gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. The discomfort arises because the audience's continued presence sends signals inconsistent with the streamer's self-devaluation based on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. The act of pushing viewers away re-establishes a familiar, albeit unhealthy, system where the streamer's value is reaffirmed only when they climb back up after a perceived fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

### The Source of Conditional Value
This reliance on external validation often stems from childhood experiences, particularly parental relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. If a child is taught that their value depends on performance, they may develop a complex relationship with pride and achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>. For instance, if a parent's pride is overtly shown when the child wins and subtly withheld or conditioned when they lose or pursue different interests, the child learns that their worth is conditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

This can lead to a fundamental sense of devalued self-worth, which then creates a need for external validation to fill that gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>. This contrasts with unconditional love, where a parent's pride is constant regardless of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. The individual might unconsciously build systems to receive external validation because direct validation from a key source (like a parent) was perceived as lacking or inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.

## Moving Towards Intrinsic Value

For true [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | personal growth]], it is crucial to shift from an external, performance-based sense of value to an intrinsic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This means:

*   **Understanding Your True Worth**: Recognizing that your inherent value as a person is separate from your performance or achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. People will stick around not just for your skill, but because they like and [[focusing_on_personal_well_being_rather_than_external_validation | value you as a person]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Detachment from Outcomes (Vairagya)**: The concept of Vairagya, a Sanskrit term, refers to detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. It suggests that success comes from focusing on the effort and [[understanding_self_and_identity_to_improve_consistency | perfecting one's craft]], rather than on external validation or outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>. This allows individuals to pursue excellence for its own sake, rather than as a means to gain approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>.
*   **Addressing the Root Cause**: Engaging in self-reflection or therapy to understand why one's intrinsic value was devalued at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This may involve having frank conversations with parents about their expectations and their perceived pride (or lack thereof) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>. It's about recognizing the unfair expectations from others and letting them go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:49">[01:30:49]</a>.
*   **[[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | Emotional Awareness]]**: A crucial aspect of [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | personal growth]] is [[building_selfawareness_for_personal_growth | understanding and processing one's emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>. Often, individuals who struggle with external validation may suppress emotions, which can manifest as anger or frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>. Learning to identify and articulate these feelings is vital for healthy relationships and self-acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>. [[Role of coaching and therapy in personal growth | Meditation practices]] focused on engaging the mind can help in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:59">[01:47:59]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to be "a thousand dollar bike" – recognizing one's inherent capabilities and worth – rather than seeing oneself as a "broken chain" constantly needing to prove itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. This fundamental shift allows for greater freedom and deeper fulfillment in [[personal_growth_and_selfacceptance | personal growth]].

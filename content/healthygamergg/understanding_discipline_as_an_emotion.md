Discipline is commonly perceived as the exertion of willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. However, willpower is finite and tends to run out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Many also believe discipline is about building habits, which are automatic behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. However, for sustained focus and long-term cultivation, neither willpower nor habits fully explain true discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The core reason discipline is hard to cultivate is a lack of understanding of its true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Discipline as an Emotion

Surprisingly, discipline is actually an emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This insight emerged from working with addiction patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. While addicts require significant discipline to overcome their substance use, psychotherapy often focuses on processing feelings rather than rigorous boot camp-style training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This suggests an intrinsic connection between emotions and discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Misconceptions in Neuroscience

Common neuroscience has historically led to a misunderstanding of emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. While negative emotions like fear and anxiety are often localized to specific anatomical brain structures (e.g., the amygdala and limbic system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, the location of positive emotions like humor, joy, or love is less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Psychotherapy is effective at reducing anxiety, but it doesn't typically teach how to be more joyful or humorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This knowledge is often found in ancient traditions like yoga, meditation, and Zen Buddhism, which uniquely understand and cultivate positive emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## The Yogic Perspective: Doubt and Resolve

Ancient yogic texts offer a profound understanding of discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Their basic observation is that opposites belong to the same category (e.g., red and blue are both colors, hot and cold are both temperatures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

Applying this to discipline, yogis concluded that **doubt** or a wavering mind is the opposite of discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. When doubt about a commitment or path arises, discipline wanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. For example, a lack of discipline in studying a chosen field might stem from underlying doubt about its suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

The opposite of doubt, according to yogic teachings, is **resolve** (Sanskrit: *sankalpa*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Therefore, cultivating resolve is the key to cultivating discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. When a person is internally resolved, their behavior naturally appears disciplined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Resolve, like other emotions, fluctuates daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

### Modern Neuroscience and Emotional Circuits

More recent and sophisticated neuroscience supports the idea that resolve is an emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Emotional brain circuitry components show that many positive emotions, including resolve, originate from complex brain *circuits* – series of connections between different brain regions (e.g., frontal lobes, limbic system, anterior cingulate cortex) – rather than single anatomical structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. This means there isn't a single "love center" or "resolve center" in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Resolve (Discipline)

To cultivate discipline, one must cultivate resolve on a daily basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. Yogic practices offer techniques for this:

1.  **Notice Resolve:** Pay attention to the feeling of being resolved. Close your eyes and observe the internal experience. Resolve acts as a "thermonuclear engine" that fuels willpower, allowing you to resist distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Practice with a Specific *Sankalpa* (Resolve):**
    *   Choose one relatively easy or medium-difficulty thing to be resolved towards (e.g., giving up ice cream for a decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. Avoid picking something too important or difficult initially, as these tend to have high emotional energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.
    *   Every day, within the first 1-1.5 hours of waking, sit down, close your eyes, and spend 5-10 minutes focusing on that specific resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. Stoke that internal emotional fire and allow the feeling of resolve to grow in a calm space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.
3.  **Advance to a Global, Emotionally Charged Resolve:**
    *   After approximately 30 days of practicing with a smaller resolve, choose a more significant, emotionally charged resolve (e.g., "I deserve to be whole") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
    *   Spend 10-20 minutes daily thinking about this resolve and letting the associated emotions arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Cultivating this positive emotional energy through daily practice will foster discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

## Obstacles to Cultivating Resolve

One significant barrier to discipline and resolve is emotional numbness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. People seeking discipline often feel a "drab gray" emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. This numbness, often used as a protection against negative emotions (like anxiety or self-doubt), prevents the cultivation of positive emotions essential for resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. When we numb out negative emotions, we also numb out positive ones, leading to a state where "either we feel everything or we feel nothing at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_building_discipline_and_emotional_awareness | Alexithymia]] is one condition related to this difficulty in experiencing emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>.

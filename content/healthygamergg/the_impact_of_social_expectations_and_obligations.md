Social expectations and obligations significantly influence an individual's self-perception, decisions, and overall well-being. These external pressures can stem from family, community, career, and even an online audience, often leading to feelings of indebtedness, compulsivity, and a hindered sense of personal identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## The Weight of Expectations

Individuals may feel a profound sense of indebtedness to their parents, particularly if they are immigrants who made significant sacrifices for their children's better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This can translate into a lifelong effort to "make parents proud" and avoid any actions that might lead to disappointment, such as abstaining from drinking or drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Strict parental rules regarding social interactions, like prohibitions on going out late or having boys in the house, can restrict a child's [[lack_of_social_experience_and_its_implications | social experience]] and lead to a more studious and compliant upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. This desire for parental validation can become a primary source of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

Beyond family, there can be a strong feeling of obligation to a wider community or audience, especially for public figures like content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This can create an overwhelming system where many people rely on one's actions, leading to constant pressure to perform and deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## The "Shoulds" and Compulsivity

A common manifestation of external expectations is the pervasive presence of "shoulds" â€“ the belief that one **should** feel or behave in a certain way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. For example, a person might feel they shouldn't cry, even when upset, because it "doesn't make sense" in a given situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This internal conflict leads to frustration when the "should" is not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

This mindset is often linked to a "problem-solver brain," which, while adaptive for [[the_educational_and_societal_expectations_on_gifted_kids | academic]] or professional success, can become a compulsive need to constantly fix and improve, leading to an obsessive focus on the "next thing that I can fix or make better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This compulsion means that even if one area of life (like personal relationships) is going well, the focus immediately shifts to another area (like work) that needs "problem-solving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This creates a cycle where there is "no 'you've done enough'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Identity

The constant pursuit of external validation and the adherence to "shoulds" can significantly hinder [[role_of_personal_and_social_environment | personal identity development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. Spending formative years focused on pleasing others and avoiding disapproval can lead to a lack of time for self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. This can result in feeling like one doesn't know who they truly are, leading to sadness and mourning for missed life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

The desire to protect parents from worry can also lead to suppressing one's true feelings, creating a "happy" persona while a "crying" self is hidden away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. This separation of self can be deeply ingrained, leading to a belief that one is "old enough" to deal with feelings independently and shouldn't burden others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. This self-insulation can lead to a sense of being "overly protected" from emotional expression and life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Public Scrutiny and Digital Burden

In the digital age, the impact of [[societal_pressures_and_its_impact_on_selfworth | social expectations]] is amplified by public scrutiny. Individuals, especially those with an online presence, face judgment from hundreds of thousands or even millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This constant external evaluation creates a profound sense of vulnerability, where "anything I do there will be like some way to twist it negatively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. The fear of public perception can make even expressing natural emotions like crying incredibly frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

This environment fosters a dynamic where people might be privately supportive but publicly critical, often to "appeal to the people that hate me as well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:23">[01:46:23]</a>. This manipulative behavior leaves the individual feeling used and abused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:58">[01:43:58]</a>. The expectation to always do the "right thing" and be helpful, even when wronged, becomes a mental calculation, leading to a "brain boom" of conflicting desires and resentments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## The Illusion of Control and Worth

[[the_impact_of_beliefs_on_perceptions_and_relationships | Cultural and societal norms]], particularly in some cultures, place a high value on external image and measurable success (e.g., being a doctor, marriage, children) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:02">[02:13:02]</a>. This can lead to a perception that worth is derived from these external metrics, rather than internal strength or authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17">[02:13:17]</a>.

This environment forces individuals to become "calculating" in their communication, fearing that any real emotion or strategic move will be deemed "fake" or "disingenuous" by their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:31">[02:17:31]</a>. This constant need to manage public perception is exhausting, leading to a feeling of not being "worthy of the benefit of the doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.

## Consequences: Jadedness, Resentment, Powerlessness

Living under constant external expectations can lead to a range of negative emotions:
*   **Jadedness and Resentment:** When individuals constantly sacrifice their own desires and perform actions they don't truly want to do, they develop resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:47">[01:39:47]</a>. This can come from doing things out of "pressure" rather than "choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:18">[01:41:18]</a>.
*   **Shame and Guilt:** If one fails to meet the perceived "shoulds," they experience shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:35">[01:40:35]</a>. Even when taking a break, guilt can quickly set in, creating a constant "flip-flop" between self-indulgence and self-reproach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Powerlessness:** The feeling that no matter what one does, it will be twisted or used against them, leads to a profound sense of powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>. This is likened to playing a game where "someone else determines who wins and who loses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>.
*   **Loneliness:** Suppressing true feelings and maintaining "scripted interactions" with even close family members can lead to a sense of being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:59">[02:29:59]</a>.

## Breaking Free

Addressing the [[the_influence_of_external_expectations_on_personal_desires | impact of social expectations]] requires a shift in perspective and behavior:
*   **Acknowledge and Mourn:** Recognize the years spent prioritizing others' expectations over self-development and allow oneself to mourn those lost experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Mourning, unlike "shoulds," involves accepting what "is" rather than what "should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Stop "Feeding the Beast":** The constant striving to be "better" is like feeding a hungry beast; it only grows and demands more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. The solution is to stop feeding it, which will feel uncomfortable initially but is necessary for balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.
*   **Embrace Authenticity:** True self-worth comes from within, not from external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:02">[02:13:02]</a>. It means accepting oneself as "perfect" not in a flawless way, but as "broken and normal human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:08">[02:54:08]</a>.
*   **Communicate Truthfully:** Share feelings, even difficult ones, with family members, allowing them to participate in one's emotional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. This means presenting both happiness and unhappiness, allowing for a two-sided relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>.
*   **Define Boundaries:** It's essential to learn where to "draw your line in the sand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:24">[01:55:24]</a>. Being a "nice guy" or constantly being helpful is not always the "right thing to do," especially if it comes at the cost of self-respect or personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:30">[01:56:30]</a>.
*   **Detachment from Outcome:** Recognize that one cannot control how others react or interpret actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>. The game is rigged when one's sense of self is placed in the hands of others. Detachment means not needing to "do anything" to fix or change perceptions, but simply to "be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:46">[02:33:46]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Exploration:** Practices like chanting and meditation can help relieve mental pressure, allowing walled-off emotions to surface and be acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:35">[02:52:35]</a>. This process fosters self-acceptance and can lead to a realization that one doesn't need to be anything other than what they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">[02:55:01]</a>.

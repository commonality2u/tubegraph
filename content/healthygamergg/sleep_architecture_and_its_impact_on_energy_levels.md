The [[understanding_tiredness_as_an_emotion | feeling of tiredness]] is a combination of [[the_impact_of_psychological_factors_on_energy_levels | mental and physiologic signals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While tiredness can be felt mentally, such as feeling fatigued at the thought of doing something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, it also has a significant physiological component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. When focusing on the [[physiological_causes_of_tiredness_and_energy_management | physiological causes of tiredness]], it's often linked to issues with energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Understanding the physiology of tiredness involves looking at two main categories: the [[circadian_rhythm_and_its_influence_on_tiredness | Circadian bucket]] and the metabolic bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This article will focus on the circadian aspect of tiredness.

## The Circadian Bucket

The [[circadian_rhythm_and_its_influence_on_tiredness | circadian rhythm]] refers to the body's natural cycles throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This includes feeling more tired at night, experiencing difficulty waking up in the morning, or having afternoon crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Much of this tiredness is related to sleep and daily cycles, rather than direct energy metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Sleep Apnea
Sleep apnea is a medical condition affecting an estimated 5-8% of people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It causes periods of breathing cessation during sleep, leading to a lack of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This triggers a survival response and a rush of adrenaline, which, despite breathing restarting, leaves the body "ragged" and exhausted upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Key signs of sleep apnea include:
*   Waking up exhausted despite 8-9 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   Needing 12-13 hours of sleep to feel rested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   Snoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Obesity or having a thick neck can increase the risk of sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Treatment often involves medical care, such as CPAP devices, or weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Circadian Rhythm Disorders
These disorders occur when an individual's biological clock is misaligned with the standard societal schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. For example, some individuals may feel most productive between 12 AM and 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Forcing oneself to wake up at 6 AM like everyone else can lead to constant exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Modern society contributes to [[circadian_rhythm_and_its_influence_on_tiredness | circadian rhythm disorders]] because we are less bound by the sun and moon than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   [[avoiding_technology_in_the_morning_to_improve_focus | Blue light from technology suppresses melatonin production]], which helps regulate sleep and schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   The 24/7 availability of food, entertainment, and social interactions can interfere with natural sleep patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

There is also interesting research on age-related [[circadian_rhythm_and_its_influence_on_tiredness | circadian rhythm]] shifts. For instance, teenagers' circadian rhythms naturally shift later due to puberty and growth spurts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Studies show that later school start times (e.g., 9 AM or 10 AM instead of 8 AM) can lead to better outcomes for teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Natural Activity Fluctuations
Human activity levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, a pattern observed across the mammalian kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This includes a midday quiet period, similar to the concept of a siesta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. There's evidence that cognitive activity is very productive between 4 AM and 6 AM, which aligns with practices in various religious traditions that involve waking up early for prayer or meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Some individuals who believe they are "night owls" may actually be very early morning people, finding their best creative work happens at 3 or 4 AM, which is consistent with the natural [[circadian_rhythm_and_its_influence_on_tiredness | circadian rhythm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Understanding Sleep Cycles
Sleep is divided into stages (1-4) and REM sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. A full sleep cycle involves progressing through these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Different stages of sleep provide different benefits; for example, a lot of "good stuff" in sleep happens in REM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

A crucial factor in waking up rested is to wake up during the right time of your sleep cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle can leave you feeling groggy, even if you've had what seems like sufficient sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. This explains why sometimes sleeping for fewer hours (e.g., 6 hours) might feel more restful than sleeping for a longer but incomplete cycle (e.g., 7-8 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

> [!INFO] Individual Sleep Needs
> The commonly cited recommendation of "8 hours of sleep" is an average based on population data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. It's important to recognize that individual sleep needs vary greatly, just as clothing sizes do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Focusing on your own sleep cycles and how you feel upon waking is more important than rigidly adhering to a generalized number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Caffeine's Effect
Caffeine operates by suppressing adenosine receptors in the brain, effectively blocking the signal of low energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. It does not provide actual energy but rather numbs the body's ability to detect fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
Relying on caffeine to combat tiredness, especially due to underlying issues like sleep apnea, can prevent individuals from recognizing and addressing their body's need for rest, leading to further problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. While moderate caffeine intake might have some health benefits due to other compounds in coffee or green tea, excessive use to mask fatigue is generally counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

### [[strategies_to_overcome_feelings_of_tiredness | Strategies to overcome feelings of tiredness]] related to Circadian Rhythm:
*   **Seek Medical Care for Sleep Apnea:** If symptoms like snoring and waking up exhausted are present, consult a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Align with Natural Rhythms:** Reduce exposure to blue light and technology before bed to support natural melatonin production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Understand Your Sleep Cycles:** Pay attention to how long you sleep and when you wake up feeling most rested, rather than strictly adhering to an 8-hour rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Strategic Napping:** Recognize and utilize natural dips in energy, like the afternoon crash, for short naps if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Adjust Caffeine Intake:** Be mindful of how caffeine masks fatigue and consider reducing intake if it's preventing you from resting when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   **Early Morning Productivity:** If you find you're a "morning person," leverage the productive hours between 4-6 AM for creative or focused work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

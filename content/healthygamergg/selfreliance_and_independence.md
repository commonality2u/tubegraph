Self-reliance and independence are significant aspects of Michael's personal journey, deeply intertwined with his experiences of anxiety and his perception of the world. His desire for independence began early in life and has shaped his approach to relationships and future planning.

## The Drive for Independence
Michael has always sought to be self-sufficient and dislikes asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. This desire for independence has been a prevalent personality trait throughout his life, recognized in retrospect as a source of past conflicts, even before high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

### Independence and Education
During high school, Michael's drive for [[independence_and_relationship_decisions | independence]] led him to teach himself computer science, motivated by a concern for job security after graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. He intentionally stopped paying attention in other classes, focusing solely on coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. This decision caused significant conflict with his parents and school counselors, who emphasized good grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. Michael felt that his English class, for example, wasn't helping him with future job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. Despite interventions, he continued on his chosen path, accepting that his parents wouldn't always see eye-to-eye with him due to different backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

## The Roots of Self-Reliance
The therapist hypothesizes that Michael's strong sense of self-reliance, and the associated existential dread, may stem from a primitive belief formed early in life that he couldn't rely on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.

The idea that he is the only person he can count on is built on an assumption that others won't be around to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. This contrasts with his logical understanding that he has a great support group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. From a feelings perspective, he feels he can only count on himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

One potential contributing factor is the way his parents, particularly his father, may not have been able to "mirror" his emotions, making the world feel confusing and unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a>. If a child's emotional needs aren't mirrored, they may feel that the world doesn't react the way they feel, leading to a reliance on self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. This concept is explored in [[attachment_theory | attachment theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>.

## Impact on Well-being
Michael's [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | lack of self-confidence]] is significant, despite appearing confident to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. He feels a lack of faith across the boardâ€”in himself and in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. This pervasive feeling is likened to being bitten by a dog hundreds of times, where the fear becomes ever-present and no longer requires a specific trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:26">[01:35:26]</a>.

The therapist also notes a correlation between high neuroticism (the tendency to worry) and conscientiousness with professional success, suggesting that this self-judgment, while painful, can drive achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. However, this success often comes at the cost of a "desolate" inner life, where despite achievements, life feels empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. Michael resonates with this, acknowledging that constantly working can be a "pitfall" that is detrimental to one's well-being as a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## Addressing the Core Issue
Michael's primary anxiety is a "nebulous dread" about the long general future of his life, which he describes as a feeling that comes before thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. This dread is not rooted in logic, as he logically believes he can overcome any challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.

The core of addressing this existential dread involves going back to earlier life experiences where feelings of being alone and having to rely solely on oneself were formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:52">[01:34:52]</a>. This process involves:
*   **Recalling and Experiencing:** Actively remembering and re-experiencing past situations that contributed to the feeling of isolation and sole reliance on self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.
*   **Self-Shepherding:** Acting as an older, more reliable version of himself (e.g., 22-year-old Michael) to comfort and reassure his younger self (e.g., 13-year-old Michael) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>. The message conveyed is that it's okay to feel alone and isolated, that he will be okay, and that there are people who love him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>.

This process allows for the "processing" of undigested emotions, known as *samskaras*, which are stored in the unconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. Unlike distraction, which merely keeps the feeling dormant, processing helps to reduce the *samskara*'s size, diminishing its pervasive influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.

> "Your feeling of existential dread is so pervasive is because you've been bit by a dog hundreds of times. And so your samskara is quite large now and you have it lives with you all the time doesn't even need a trigger it's just like there all the time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>

Michael notes that understanding the origin of his feelings provided a sense of help and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. This suggests that the act of bringing unconscious patterns to conscious awareness can initiate a positive shift.

## Tools for Growth
*   **Mindfulness and Presence:** Michael acknowledges that being in the present helps with anxiety, as anxiety is always future-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. Physical activities like balancing exercises or yoga can help cultivate presence by demanding intense focus on the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:57">[01:47:57]</a>. Yoga, for instance, forces the mind into the present by requiring stability and attention to posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>.
*   **Self-Reflection and Analysis:** Using the analytical mind (buddhi) to analyze and process emotions helps to reduce the impact of raw, guttural reactions (manas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Therapy:** Therapy is described as a process that helps individuals process their emotions, much like the detailed analytical process discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. Michael considers this option for his [[selfawareness_and_mental_health | mental health]].

By continuing to engage in these practices, Michael hopes to reduce the intensity of his existential dread and foster a more integrated [[personal_growth_and_selfacceptance | sense of self]] and [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | personal growth]].

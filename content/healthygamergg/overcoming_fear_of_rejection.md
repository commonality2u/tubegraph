[[Overcoming fear of rejection]] stems from deep-seated core beliefs about one's self-worth, often manifesting as a fear of being perceived as boring, uninteresting, or not valuable to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This can lead to a cycle of building courage to reach out, only to then ghost people out of fear they will discover one's perceived inadequacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Mind's Internal Conflict
The mind experiencing [[overcoming_fear_of_rejection | fear of rejection]] often operates with an internal conflict:
*   **The Need for Connection:** A desire to talk to others to avoid being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **The Fear of Exposure:** The belief that if one talks to people, they will realize the individual has "no substance as a person" or is "uninteresting or unfunny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

This conflict leads to a pattern where courage to connect is bolstered by willpower, but this is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Over time, willpower decreases, leading to ghosting, which in turn reinforces negative self-perceptions and intensifies the core belief of being invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Rationalizations and Defense Mechanisms
The mind employs rationalizations as defense mechanisms to protect against the painful cycle of rejection and self-reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Examples include:
*   **"They will realize I'm not valuable"**: This implies a feeling of pretending or being an imposter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **"My close friends are too close to realize how pathetic I am"**: This is an illogical fear, as close friends typically experience one's authentic self, not a mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **"No point in trying to hang out if they are going to find out eventually"**: The mind tells you not to bother to protect against rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This leads to the conclusion that "reaching out just makes you feel bad," thus creating a self-protective urge to avoid interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## The Root Cause: Lack of Self-Value
At the core of this issue is a belief of being "not valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. All other fears, rationalizations, and behaviors stem from this fundamental belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The question becomes: "Where did you learn that you're not valuable?" and "Why do you believe others are better than you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### The Role of Ahamkara
The concept of *ahamkara* (ego/identity) is relevant here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. If the identity is rooted in the belief "I'm a bad person," it leads to idealizing others, perceiving them as "awesome" and "on a different level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Strategies for Overcoming
To [[overcoming_fear_of_rejection | overcome fear of rejection]], it is essential to address the core belief of not being valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While symptomatic relief can be helpful, the most effective approach is tackling the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

When the core belief of being invaluable is dismantled, all other issues stemming from it — the rationalizations, defense mechanisms, and behavioral cycles — will begin to crumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This is likened to finding the "core" of the problem, where working on it causes "all the other crap" to come "crumbling down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### The Impact of Self-Improvement
Individuals who have engaged in years of self-improvement and therapy may find that their core issues are "right under the surface," making them more receptive to breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This highlights that while finding the core problem can lead to rapid change, it often builds upon prior self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to simply "show up and give it everything you've got" in interactions, without expecting specific outcomes, embracing that one's best effort is their *dharma* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

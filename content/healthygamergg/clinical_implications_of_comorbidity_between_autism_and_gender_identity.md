Recent research highlights a significant [[link_between_autism_and_gender_identity | link between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and gender identity issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, suggesting a crucial area for clinical evaluation. A new [[metaanalysis_on_autism_and_gender_identity | meta-analysis]] published in March 2022, authored primarily by Khalid Sunaki, synthesizes an explosion of research over the last decade on this relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Key Findings of the Meta-Analysis
The [[metaanalysis_on_autism_and_gender_identity | meta-analysis]] pooled data from 41 different studies examining the [[link_between_autism_and_gender_identity | link between Autism Spectrum Disorder and gender identity disorder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This synthesis allows for high-quality conclusions by combining numerous smaller sample sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The paper revealed several significant findings:

*   **Autism to Gender Identity Issues**: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder are 11 times more likely to have gender identity issues compared to the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Specifically, people with autism are four times as likely to endorse gender dysphoria or gender identity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Furthermore, 15% of individuals with ASD report being non-binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Parents also reported increased gender variance in children with more autistic traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Gender Identity Issues to Autism Traits**:
    *   Among children with gender identity issues, 3% to 21% have a high degree of Autism Spectrum Disorder or traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   For adults with gender identity issues, about 4.8% to 7.8% will either have autism or test highly for autistic traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Analogy for Directional Probability
> Understanding the difference between these two statistics is crucial. It's like asking "What percentage of doctors are Indian?" versus "What percentage of Indians are doctors?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Both are valid questions, but they address different probabilities and can help understand causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Significance of the Comorbidity
The strong link between ASD and gender identity issues has several important implications:

### Neurodevelopmental Trajectories
Both Autism Spectrum Disorder and gender identity develop over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The brains of individuals with ASD follow different neurodevelopmental trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, which may explain how these two conditions could interact developmentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Genetic and Epigenetic Factors
The comorbidity prompts questions about shared genetic or [[epigenetics | epigenetic]] causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. There could be a single gene that predisposes individuals to both, or a gene for autism that influences the development of gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

> [!INFO] Epigenetics
> **Epigenetics** refers to the turning on or turning off of genes, which can be influenced by experiences or environmental factors, even if the underlying genetic code is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. For example, trauma can activate certain genes related to stress response, leading to conditions like PTSD in some individuals but not others with similar genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Mentalization Challenges
One prominent theory suggests that individuals with ASD have [[mentalization_challenges_in_autism_and_gender_identity | difficulty mentalizing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Mentalizing is the capacity to understand what is in the mind of someone who performs an action, including one's own actions and internal thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Since gender identity is largely internally determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, difficulty understanding one's internal state could lead to struggles in understanding one's own gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This suggests that [[mentalization_challenges_in_autism_and_gender_identity | mentalization training]] could be beneficial for individuals with both conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Applicability for Individuals
For individuals, recognizing this link means:
*   If you are struggling with [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]] and haven't been evaluated for autism, consider doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   If you have an autism diagnosis or high autistic traits and haven't explored gender identity issues, it may be worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Confusion about gender identity can manifest as difficulties forming romantic relationships, which is sometimes mistaken for a lack of social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Resolving this confusion can make it easier to engage in significant romantic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Applicability for Clinicians
For clinicians, the high [[prevalence_of_gender_identity_issues_in_autism_spectrum | rates of comorbidity]] are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>:
*   When working with a client on the autism spectrum, it's worthwhile to evaluate them for [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]] and offer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   When working with someone experiencing [[gender_identity_and_transition_experiences | gender identity issues]], it's beneficial to evaluate them for autism traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   Both conditions independently increase the risk of mental distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, and their co-occurrence may have a multiplicative effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Addressing both is crucial for patient well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Defining 'Disorder' and 'Comorbidity'
The terms "comorbidity" and "disorder" have roots in the assumption of illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. While society grapples with whether conditions like autism are disorders or simply acceptable variants of human beings (leading to terms like neurodiverse vs. neurotypical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, the dividing line often used in medical fields is **impairment of function** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. For example, severe autism leading to inability to perform daily activities without substantial help is generally classified as a disorder due to functional impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This classification does not place a value judgment on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Addressing 'Making Up' Gender Issues
When a client, especially a teenager, presents with gender identity issues, the clinical approach should prioritize exploration and support rather than immediately questioning if they are "making it up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. While it's possible to assess for malingering using scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>, directly accusing someone of faking it usually does not resolve the underlying psychological need that might be driving such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. The recommended approach is to support the individual psychologically in discovering and understanding their gender identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Providing support can help individuals arrive at a conclusion about their gender identity in a healthy way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. If malingering is suspected, the clinician should address the underlying reasons for it, rather than just dismissing the presented issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Conclusion
The strong [[link_between_autism_and_gender_identity | link between autism and gender identity]] is a significant finding that demands attention from both individuals and clinicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. While the exact causation (chicken or egg) is still unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, understanding potential mechanisms like [[mentalization_challenges_in_autism_and_gender_identity | difficulties with mentalizing]] offers a path forward for supporting individuals with both conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Routine evaluation for both conditions when one is present can significantly improve outcomes and reduce mental distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

To develop consistency in life, many believe it's about leveling up stats like [[impact_of_gaming_on_motivation_and_confidence | motivation]], [[impact_of_gaming_on_motivation_and_confidence | discipline]], or willpower, or building habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, the core problem with developing consistency isn't a lack of these qualities; it's a lack of self-knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Fluctuating Self: Life as a Multiplayer Game

The fundamental issue is that "you" are not living one continuous life; you are "constantly spawning into some random dude's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This concept, that the source of suffering stems from *avidya* (ignorance of our true selves), was discovered by yogis thousands of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. You know you're not the same person every day, wishing you could consistently be the highly productive version of yourself from a specific past date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The "you" actually fluctuates significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The key to consistency lies in understanding that "you don't exist beyond today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Your life is effectively a multiplayer game where different, random versions of "you" wake up and get to live life one day at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This means the person waking up tomorrow is not the same as the person going to sleep today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This daily shift means you frequently "screw over tomorrow you" by procrastinating tasks, leaving them for the "next guy or girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Applying Gaming Principles to Life's "Flow"

[[applying_gaming_principles_to_real_life_challenges | Gamers]] are often good at understanding the flow and principles of a video game to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This approach can be used to [[applying_gaming_principles_to_real_life_challenges | apply that to life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Games have a distinct flow:
*   **Early Game**: Leveling up and preparing for the mid-game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Mid Game**: Hitting a "power spike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **End Game**: Closing out with an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

In [[applying_gaming_principles_to_real_life_challenges | playing the game of life]], people often lack this consistency. For example, neglecting study habits in high school (early game) leads to disadvantages in college and their twenties (mid game), causing struggles later in life (late game) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This is akin to playing a game with an "Elon Musk Elden Ring build," dumping points randomly without a cohesive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## The Neuroscience of "Future Discounting"

The human brain is wired for "future discounting," meaning it values immediate rewards more than distant ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain, is wired to value immediate things over distant ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This is why procrastination is fundamental to the human species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

This phenomenon explains why people neglect things for their future selves. When there's no conception of the future or a sense of stewardship, people tend to "screw things over for the next person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This applies not just to desires and emotions, but also to deeper values and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. For example, buying a musical instrument with enthusiasm on January 1st and then losing interest by January 3rd because the "person that you are has changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Cultivating a "Custodian Mentality"

To achieve consistency, embrace the idea that you are merely a "custodian" of this life for the person who comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Your life is not a continuous existence but a "weird body swap comedy" where different consciousnesses take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Consider playing a MOBA game for only five minutes, knowing someone else will take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Even without the joy of winning, you would strive to play your best to set up the next player for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Games go wrong when players get tilted by early setbacks and intentionally "feed" or "run it down mid," screwing over the next player who inherits the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Similarly, in life, connecting the present to a distant outcome can lead to "tilting" and loss of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Instead, ask yourself: "How can I play this game to improve things for the person who comes next?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This "custodian" mindset, where you acknowledge you don't get to win at the end, will paradoxically help you build consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## The Importance of Self-Compassion

A critical pitfall in this process is a lack of self-compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. If you don't love yourself, there's no point in making sacrifices for your future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. We make sacrifices for what we love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. If you don't care about the person inheriting tomorrow, you're more likely to act hedonistically and create a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

In conclusion, to live a life of consistency, you must accept that there is no inherent consistency within you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. You are a temporary custodian, constantly spawning into this life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. By understanding this, you can consciously choose to set things up better for the "person who's going to inherit tomorrow," rather than creating a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This paradoxical understanding, combining gaming concepts with ancient wisdom about *avidya*, leads to solving life's problems and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

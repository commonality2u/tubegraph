Internalizing beliefs that the subconscious disagrees with, such as the idea of self-love, can be challenging [00:00:05]. Logically, one might understand the importance of self-love, but changing the deeply ingrained feeling of not loving oneself requires more than just intellectual understanding [00:00:30]. This process of transforming core beliefs is intrinsically linked to one's state of mind and the ability to focus.

## How Beliefs Sink In: The Role of Mental State

Learning and internalizing information or new beliefs is highly dependent on the mind's state. Just as reading a textbook repeatedly doesn't guarantee understanding until the mind is ready to "get it," deeply planting a belief requires the right conditions [00:01:15, 00:01:41].

The speaker's experience in medical school illustrates this point: studying for only two hours a day was effective because the mind was completely clear and focused [00:02:36, 00:04:23]. In contrast, a distracted mind, such as one grappling with a breakup or a chaotic environment, prevents information from sinking in, requiring multiple readings without comprehension [00:03:31, 00:03:52, 00:04:05].

### The Mind as a Pool of Water

To understand how beliefs plant themselves, imagine the mind as a pool of water with dirt in it [00:06:25]. The more agitated the water, the more stirred up the dirt, making it impossible to see the bottom (the subconscious) [00:06:36]. For something to sink deep and be understood, the mind must be still [00:06:39]. When there's a lot of mental activity, anything new put in will not sink in because of the existing "stuff in the way" [00:06:47, 00:06:52].

## Transforming Subconscious Beliefs through Meditation

To internalize desired beliefs and plant them deeply within the subconscious, the mind needs to be calmed [00:06:55, 00:11:46, 00:13:42]. One potent technique for achieving this is [[role_of_mindfulness_and_meditation | Yoga Nidra]], which calms the mind on a surface level, allowing for the rewriting of subconscious code [00:01:01, 00:08:27, 00:12:24].

### The Power of Sankalpa

A key component of this process is the "Sankalpa" (or "Sun cult"), which is a statement made about oneself that is planted into the subconscious during a calm mental state [00:08:34, 00:10:11, 00:11:01, 00:11:10, 00:12:22, 00:12:31]. The mind, being specific to each individual, sends up unique thoughts, desires, and anxieties from the subconscious [00:08:49, 00:09:20, 00:09:36]. Instead of fighting negative thoughts as they bubble up, the practice involves planting positive, inspirational thoughts that, with regular practice, will automatically begin to surface [00:10:03, 00:11:27, 00:12:05].

[[Meditation and SelfRealization in Mental Health | Meditation]] effectively allows access to and editing of the "source code" of one's inner self [00:13:15, 00:13:23]. This creates a "permanent buff" â€“ an automatic positive outlook or trait that becomes effortless and transforms one's being [00:10:09, 00:13:02, 00:14:04, 00:14:42]. This is not about control or willpower, but about changing the underlying programming [00:11:27, 00:12:12].

### Choosing Your Sankalpa

Selecting a Sankalpa requires reflection. It should be a statement that one wants to reinforce over a long period, ideally for about a year, as it's not a temporary desire [00:15:23, 00:15:29]. An example of a powerful Sankalpa for someone who has experienced trauma is, "I deserve to be whole" [00:15:39]. The focus of Sankalpa is on personal [[Role of selfawareness and meditation in controlling the mind | character creation]] and self-improvement, rather than seeking external factors like luck [00:15:58, 00:16:11, 00:16:26].

## Scientific Backing for Meditation's Impact

Beyond the spiritual or metaphorical explanations, there is overwhelming [[Scientific evidence supporting meditation for improved academic performance | scientific evidence supporting meditation]] [00:17:14]. Regular meditation demonstrably improves attention, concentration, and memory [00:17:18, 00:17:22]. The speaker himself initially relied on scientific support when choosing his meditation practices [00:17:30, 00:17:51]. Therefore, consistent meditation can lead to tangible benefits like an improved GPA, irrespective of belief in the "hokey stuff" of Sankalpa and the subconscious [00:17:57, 00:18:03].

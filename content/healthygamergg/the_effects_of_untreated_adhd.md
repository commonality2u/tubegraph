[[understanding_adhd_and_its_impact_on_daily_life | ADHD]] affects individuals whether it is diagnosed or not, and it will continue to impair functioning regardless of a formal diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Living a life with untreated ADHD can lead to a variety of significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Impact on Daily Functioning
Untreated ADHD can disrupt a person's life in many ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. If daily attention is required for tasks like work, an individual cannot afford to have their ADHD symptoms manifest, even for a small percentage of the time, as this can lead to job loss or other negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## [[Developmental Impact of ADHD | Developmental Impact of ADHD]]
Growing up with [[Developmental Impact of ADHD | untreated ADHD]] significantly shapes an individual's life, predisposing them to later mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Link to Depression
There is a causal relationship where ADHD can lead to depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Specifically, 50% to 70% of individuals with ADHD may also experience depression later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Social Isolation and Skill Development
Children with ADHD are statistically less likely to be invited to birthday parties compared to neurotypical children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This happens because individuals with ADHD may struggle with paying attention in conversations, leading to unrelated comments that make them seem "weird" to peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This lack of social inclusion results in fewer opportunities to develop social skills, leading to increased social isolation and loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

### Academic and Professional Challenges
[[Challenges of ADHD in academic and work settings | Academic underachievement]] is common for children with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. In adulthood, rusty social skills developed from childhood isolation can make it harder for individuals with ADHD to get promoted at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. These factors contribute to the risk of depression later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

## The Role of Diagnosis
A diagnosis of ADHD, while not changing the underlying condition, provides the opportunity to engage in treatment and address its impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## [[Overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of ADHD | Overdiagnosis and Underdiagnosis]]
ADHD is unique in being both over-diagnosed and under-diagnosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Underdiagnosis**: Often, ADHD is missed in childhood, leading to adult diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This can occur when highly intelligent children develop compensatory mechanisms, like quickly deducing answers in class, which effectively mask their inattention and prevent diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Overdiagnosis**: ADHD can also be over-diagnosed when parents attribute behavioral issues, such as a child not listening or being distracted, to ADHD, rather than examining factors like lack of attention training, unhealthy boundaries, or excessive screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This means symptoms that could be managed through behavioral changes might be misattributed.

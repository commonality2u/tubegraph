The internet and social media have profoundly impacted employment dynamics, leading to significant shifts in worker perceptions and corporate practices. This influence is seen in the rise of movements like the anti-work subreddit and the broader phenomenon of mass resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Internet as an Equalizer

The internet is identified as a major societal equalizer, comparable to the printing press and gunpowder in its ability to level the playing field between unequal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Its primary impact lies in the widespread [[influence_of_social_media_on_mental_health | dissemination of information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Historically, individuals in small towns with undesirable jobs had limited awareness of other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The internet, particularly social media, has changed this by fostering a greater awareness that "better things out there" exist, leading to a realization that one's current situation doesn't have to be permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This newfound awareness has been "absolutely devastating for certain employers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

While social media can lead to issues like FOMO and excessive comparison, it is fundamentally a tool that can be used for both positive and negative ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. In the context of employment, it has removed the "ignorance" that corporations previously exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Just as access to information has led to better restaurants by allowing consumers to find and gravitate towards quality, the internet has enabled workers to identify and move towards better companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## [[COVID19s Impact on Work Dynamics | COVID-19's Impact]] on Work Dynamics

The COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst, accelerating trends enabled by the internet, such as remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The pandemic revealed that many jobs do not require daily commutes or physical presence in an office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This revelation was significant for many workers.

Furthermore, remote work capabilities, amplified by the internet, have eliminated geographical restrictions on job options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Previously, workers in "company towns" with limited local employers had little choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Now, with online work, employees can apply for jobs in different states or even countries, countering the corporate practice of "geographical predation" and outsourcing that favored employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This shift has created a "reverse" dynamic where employees now have more leverage to seek better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

The pandemic also prompted many individuals to re-evaluate their priorities, realizing they may not need as much money as previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The trade-off between higher pay and excessive work hours or long commutes (e.g., an extra $5,000-$10,000 not being worth 15 additional hours per week) became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## [[Psychological and Evolutionary Perspectives on Employment | Evolutionary Selection Pressure]] on Employment

The internet and the shifts brought by COVID-19 have created a new "selection pressure" on employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Previously, companies' poor practices went unchecked due to a lack of consequences in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Now, workers are collectively choosing specific types of jobs and rejecting others, leading to a perceived "labor shortage" which is more accurately a "wage shortage" or a "crappy job shortage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

This "karmic seed" of unchecked corporate excesses is coming to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Companies that have continuously "won" (e.g., through automation without reducing prices, outsourcing without considering local job loss) without facing consequences are now experiencing pushback from workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

## The Psychological Mistake of Employers

A major psychological error by employers is their invalidation of workers' experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Instead of addressing genuine problems, many companies resort to Public Relations (PR) to fix the *perception* of a problem rather than the problem itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. This lack of transparency and unwillingness to listen to employees is deeply invalidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

Calling workers "lazy" or blaming "government handouts" is a form of blaming others and absolving responsibility, akin to blaming a misbehaving child instead of understanding the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This approach further alienates employees, leading to worsened "acting out," such as mass quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

Companies have two choices: continue to invalidate employees and risk closure, or genuinely address worker concerns, fairly compensate them, and improve the work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. While employees may always feel they could be better compensated (a aspect of [[Psychological and Evolutionary Perspectives on Employment | human psychology]]), there is a middle ground where employers can genuinely listen and strive to make employees happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

The "great resignation" is a long-anticipated phenomenon resulting from corporate invalidation and the new awareness workers have about their options, including the ability to work remotely and the realization that exploitation is no longer worth the compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Companies that prioritize employee well-being and satisfaction, like Costco, are examples of those that successfully navigate this new landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

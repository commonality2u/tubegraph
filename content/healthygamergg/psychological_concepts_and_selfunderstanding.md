Understanding how the mind works and applying psychological concepts can be helpful in navigating personal challenges, such as anxiety and self-judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:05">[02:03:05]</a>. The pursuit of [[Understanding self and identity to improve consistency | understanding of self]] is a fundamental aspect of human psychology, often linked to concepts like enlightenment, which suggests a complete comprehension of one's own being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Types of Anxiety

Anxiety is a broad term that encompasses various experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>:
*   **Neurotic Anxiety**
    *   This type of anxiety involves worrying about future consequences of present actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>. The more problems one can foresee, the greater the anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. It is a [[Selfawareness and mental health | cognitive component]] of anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:29:00">[31:29:00]</a>.
*   **Physiological Anxiety**
    *   This is a physical sensation of anxiety, where thoughts do not necessarily result in dread, but the feeling of dread might latch onto thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. It manifests with physical symptoms like an elevated heart rate, indicating a sympathetic nervous response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>. This type of anxiety is not always rooted in the mind, but its physiological changes can affect mental function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.
    *   Adrenaline, a hormone released during stress, can increase thought speed, make thoughts black and white, and cause possibilities to feel like realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>. This is an evolutionary response designed to promote survival by treating potential dangers as immediate realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.
*   **Existential Dread**
    *   Described as a "nebulous dread" or general sense of foreboding about the long general future of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. It can be ever-present and not necessarily tied to specific thoughts or events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. Michael's experience with existential dread began in high school, stemming from worries about post-graduation survival and a deep-seated desire for self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. This dread is a feeling that often stems from a non-logical part of the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:00">[47:56:00]</a>.

## Self-Judgment and its Role

Self-judgment is distinct from anxiety; it involves beating oneself up for past actions, such as thinking "I didn't do a good job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>. While not anxiety itself, self-judgment can fuel anxiety by making the future seem bleaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>.
*   **Correlation with Success**: Paradoxically, high levels of [[role_of_generalizations_and_biases_in_shaping_selfperception | neuroticism]] and conscientiousness are correlated with professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>. This suggests that a degree of self-judgment and worry can drive individuals to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25:00">[36:25:00]</a>. However, this often leads to a "desolate" feeling in successful individuals, where achievements don't bring fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>.

## The Brain and Certainty

The human brain is primarily designed to create certainty from uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. It takes vast amounts of unknown information and provides answers, even if those answers are not logically derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.
*   **Fabricated Reasons**: The mind is designed to fabricate logical reasons for illogical behavior. For example, a person might buy a cookie at a checkout due to its placement, but then rationalize the purchase with a fabricated reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>. This process works backward from a conclusion to create an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>.

## Sanskara: Undigested Emotion

Experiences, particularly those from a young age, can lead to the formation of "sanskara" – a ball of undigested emotion stored in the unconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. When faced with similar triggers, these dormant fears can resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.
*   **Formation**: If an individual does not have the chance to sit down and process an event—to think about what happened, what they did right or wrong, and the context—they may be left with a sanskara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. Distraction, especially for children, can prevent this processing, leading to the fear going dormant and resurfacing later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>.
*   **Michael's Sanskara**: Michael's pervasive existential dread is attributed to a large sanskara, built up from numerous experiences where he felt like the only person he could rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>.

## Parts of the Mind: Manas and Buddhi

Ancient wisdom traditions offer models for understanding the mind:
*   **Manas (Emotional Mind)**: This part of the mind is responsible for immediate reactions, likes, and dislikes. It's often described as guttural and visceral, operating within zero to one second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>. In early childhood, the Manas is largely in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. Existential dread is described as a "Manas thing" – a raw, gut-level sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.
*   **Buddhi (Analytical Mind/Intellect)**: This is the rational, analytical part of the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Unlike the Manas, the Buddhi develops over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>. It plays a crucial role in processing emotions and understanding experiences, differentiating adult reactions from those of a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.

## Origin of Existential Dread: Early Life Experiences

Michael's existential dread, the "worry about not being able to take care of yourself," is built on the unconscious assumption that others will not be around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:50:00">[57:50:00]</a>. This belief stems from early life experiences and is a "primitive formation" because it was formed when he was very young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:29:00">[58:29:00]</a>.
*   **Independence and Isolation**: A child who is not understood by their parents may become independent and feel that they are the only one they can rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>. This can lead to a feeling of being alone and isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>. When trusted figures (like parents or a school counselor) dismiss deeply felt concerns, it can reinforce the belief that one cannot count on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.
*   **Lack of Confidence**: The worry about self-reliance can also come from a lack of [[understanding_and_addressing_selfesteem_issues | confidence]] in oneself and a lack of faith in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:35:00">[59:35:00]</a>.
*   **Empathic Mirroring (Attachment Theory)**: [[Navigating selfidentity and relationships | Confidence development]] in a child is often tied to how secure they feel with their parents, which depends on how much their parents "mirror" their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>. When parents cannot mirror a child's emotional needs, the world can become a confusing place, fostering a sense that the child can only rely on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. This aligns with [[Identity development and self exploration | attachment theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:23">[01:39:23]</a>.

## Addressing Existential Dread and Fostering [[Personal Growth and Selfacceptance | Self-Acceptance]]

To address existential dread, one approach is to acknowledge and accept it rather than pushing it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. This is a healthier way of dealing with negative feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.
*   **Processing Past Experiences**: To reduce the sanskara, one can actively recall and re-experience past events where the feeling of isolation or dread arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>. This process involves the Buddhi (analytical mind) to understand the event and its impact, effectively "processing" the emotion rather than letting it go dormant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.
*   **Being a "Shepherd" for Your Younger Self**: Individuals can become a supportive figure for their younger, past self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>. For example, a 22-year-old Michael can go back and assure a 13-year-old Michael that it's okay to feel alone, that he will be okay, and that there are people who love him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:38">[01:40:38]</a>. This [[building_selfawareness_for_personal_growth | self-reflection]] and emotional validation can help diminish the pervasive feeling of dread over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[01:41:24]</a>.

## Cultivating Presence through Body-Based Practices

Being in the present moment is a key strategy to counter anxiety, which is always future-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>.
*   **Meditation**: Different types of meditation exist (cognitive, physical, psychological, spiritual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>. For focusing on the present, physical meditations are suggested.
*   **Yoga**: Yoga postures are designed not for physical health, but to focus the mind on the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:13">[01:49:13]</a>. A posture that is stable and challenging can force the mind to concentrate, preventing it from wandering to the past or future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:34">[01:49:34]</a>.
*   **Balance Exercises**: Activities that challenge balance, such as standing on one leg with eyes closed, demand intense focus on the present to maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. This physical engagement can force one into the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:18">[01:46:18]</a>.
*   **Physical Endurance**: Holding a simple, tiring posture, like arms extended, can also force present moment awareness as the body demands attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:21">[01:50:21]</a>.

These practices can [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | facilitate personal growth and self-awareness]] by training the mind to be present, thereby reducing the impact of anxious thoughts about the future.

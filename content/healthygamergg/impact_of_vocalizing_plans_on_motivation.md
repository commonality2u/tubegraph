Dr. K, a psychiatrist who previously studied to become a monk, teaches how to prevent [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation]] from diminishing or "leaking away" by understanding the relationship between language and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Tantric Mantra Principle

The concept of preserving [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation]] can be understood through an ancient Indian principle involving a secret [[mantras_and_their_role_in_internal_motivation | Mantra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. When initiated into a secret [[mantras_and_their_role_in_internal_motivation | Mantra]], practitioners are instructed to keep it secret, as revealing it diminishes its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Conversely, chanting and cultivating the [[mantras_and_their_role_in_internal_motivation | Mantra]] internally allows its power to grow, leading to material and spiritual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This principle suggests that by *not* externalizing positive internal energy, it compounds and drives positive changes in one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Scientific Parallel: Psychotherapy and Venting Trauma

This ancient principle has a scientific parallel in modern psychotherapy, particularly with trauma patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
When a traumatized individual vents their trauma in a non-judgmental, compassionate space with a therapist, the internal energy of that trauma diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. By vocalizing negative emotions, shame, and traumatic experiences, their power to control one's life ceases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Psychotherapy aims to take internal negativity and have it vocalized externally, thereby reducing its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The [[mantras_and_their_role_in_internal_motivation | Mantra]] concept is the exact opposite: instead of venting negative energy, it involves compounding positive internal energy by *not* externalizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Applying the Principle to Positive Intentions

When individuals talk about their plans or intentions, especially on social media, they often diminish their internal energy to follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   **"Entrepreneur Bros" vs. Doers**: People who constantly post about their entrepreneurial aspirations ("I'ma start a company," "I'm a sigma grind set") often don't follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. In contrast, genuinely successful entrepreneurs focus on running their companies rather than constantly talking about it online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **External Validation**: When people vocalize future plans (e.g., "I want to become a doctor"), they often receive positive external reinforcement and praise, making others impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This external reward reinforces the act of talking rather than the act of doing, leading to a diminished [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation]] to follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   [[impact_of_gaming_on_motivation_and_confidence | **Gaming**]]: The same principle applies in [[impact_of_gaming_on_motivation_and_confidence | gaming]]. Individuals who spend time "theory crafting" and arguing online about their skills or future achievements often perform less well than those who quietly practice and play the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The more one vents what they intend to do, the less motivated and successful they become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### [[the_advantage_of_introverts_in_motivation_cultivation | Introvert Advantage]]

[[the_advantage_of_introverts_in_motivation_cultivation | Introverts]] have a natural advantage in [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | cultivating motivation]] because they are less inclined to talk about their plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. By storing their internal energy and channeling it into action rather than language, [[the_advantage_of_introverts_in_motivation_cultivation | introvert]] entrepreneurs often find greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Freud's Insight: Language as a Substitute for Action

Sigmund Freud discovered that language can serve as a substitute for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, talking to a deceased loved one at their grave can provide catharsis and closure, serving as a substitute for actions that couldn't be performed while they were alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This indicates that language and action are intrinsically linked and draw from the same "pool of energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This explains why there are "talkers" and "doers," but rarely individuals who are both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## [[tips_on_conserving_motivational_energy | Strategies for Managing Motivation]]

To prevent [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation]] from leaking away:

*   **Pay Attention to Your Speech**: Observe how often you talk about what you want to do versus what you actually accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. There is often an inverse correlation between talking about something and doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **"Shut the Hell Up"**: Especially on social media, avoid posting extensively about your hopes and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. If you have a specific goal, do not tell anyone about it; keep that energy within you to let it compound and build up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Intentional Communication**: While not all communication should be avoided, be very intentional about the scope and purpose of conversations related to your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Every word spoken depletes [[the_concept_of_motivation_and_its_challenges | motivation]], so conversations should only occur when the benefit clearly outweighs the cost of venting that energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Journaling**: If you want to vent something, you need to re-internalize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. For negative emotions, journaling allows you to externalize them and be done with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For positive aspirations, if you journal about them, you should read them again to bring that energy back into yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Similarly, listening to a chanted [[mantras_and_their_role_in_internal_motivation | Mantra]] can help re-internalize positive effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

By keeping positive aspirations internal, allowing that energy to compound and build pressure, it can then be channeled effectively into action rather than words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

The [[personal_growth_and_selfacceptance | spiritual journey and self-acceptance]] involves understanding one's true self, navigating societal and personal expectations, and embracing who you "are" rather than who you "should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:51">[02:39:51]</a>. It addresses how external pressures and an internal "problem-solver brain" can lead to deep-seated feelings of frustration, resentment, and a perceived inability to genuinely express oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>.

## The Concept of "Should" vs. "Is"

A central theme in [[philosophy_and_personal_insights_on_happiness_and_selfacceptance | philosophy and personal insights on happiness and self-acceptance]] is the distinction between "should" and "is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:51">[02:39:51]</a>. Many individuals live by a constant sense of "should," feeling obligated to be something they are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

### Origins of "Should"
The belief in what one "should" be often stems from various sources:
*   **Parental Expectations** Growing up, children of immigrants, for example, may feel a deep indebtedness to their parents, leading to a lifelong pursuit of making them proud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This can manifest as avoiding behaviors that would lead to disapproval, such as drinking or drugs, and striving for academic or professional success to validate their parents' sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solver Brain** An individual with a "problem-solver brain," often developed through academic or professional pursuits like mathematics and engineering, learns to constantly "min/max" and optimize for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>. This adaptive trait, while leading to success, can become compulsive, obsessively seeking the "next thing to fix or make better" in one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>.
*   **Community and Viewer Expectations** For public figures, the sense of "should" extends to their community and audience, leading to feelings of being indebted to viewers for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:48">[02:04:48]</a>. There is a constant pressure to meet external expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:05">[02:10:05]</a>.
*   **Societal and Cultural Norms** Cultures can heavily emphasize external validation and image, judging individuals based on achievements and status rather than internal worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>. This can lead to a belief that one "should" always strive for perfection, or face judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.

### Consequences of "Should"
Living by "shoulds" can lead to significant internal conflict and distress:
*   **Frustration and Crying** When one tries to suppress emotions like crying, believing they "shouldn't" feel that way, it leads to internal frustration and a feeling that emotions are constantly regenerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Feeling Alone and Unjustified** Individuals may feel alone in their struggles, especially when they perceive themselves as "privileged" and thus "unjustified" in feeling negative emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This belief stems from the "toxic" gatekeeping of suffering, where success is wrongly equated with invulnerability to pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.
*   **Guilt and Never Enough** When success comes from constantly striving, there is no "rubric" for "enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. Taking a break or not meeting perceived "shoulds" leads to immense guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. This endless cycle is akin to feeding a "beast" of expectation that is never satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:10]</a>.
*   **Resentment and Shame** If one gives in to the "shoulds" and accomplishes what is expected, the result is often resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:29">[01:40:29]</a>. If one fails to accomplish them, it leads to shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:35">[01:40:35]</a>. This jadedness comes from being pushed into giving more than one wants to give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:33">[01:41:33]</a>.
*   **Powerlessness and Defensive Reactions** Feeling powerless in situations where one's actions are constantly twisted or used against them online can lead to a sense of being attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>. This triggers defensiveness, both in oneself and in others, creating a cycle of hurt and attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>.

## The Spiritual Journey and Self-Acceptance

The [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | spiritual journey]] is about embracing "what is" and nurturing one's true identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>.

### Mourning and Acceptance
Mourning is the process of moving from "should" to "acceptance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. When one feels sad for the past, or for missed opportunities for [[identity_development_and_self_exploration | identity development and self-exploration]], it is a natural and necessary form of mourning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. This involves acknowledging what has been lost or neglected without wishing it "should" be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>.

### Detachment and Self-Worth
True self-worth comes from within, not from external validation or opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:58">[02:13:58]</a>. The game of seeking external validation is often "rigged" because one cannot control how others perceive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>. Detachment is not about "not caring" but about building inner strength so that external negativity cannot penetrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>. This is part of [[finding_inner_voice_and_selfdiscovery | finding inner voice and self-discovery]].

> [!info] The "Hydra" of Online Criticism
> Online communities, like Twitch or Reddit, can be likened to a Hydra: chop off one head, and two more grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:12">[02:01:12]</a>. Attempts to argue or "win" against constant criticism are futile. However, the "Hydra" also has many heads that are supportive; the challenge is to focus on the positive while acknowledging the negative without letting it define one's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:52">[02:02:52]</a>.

### Speaking Your Truth and Navigating Relationships
Authenticity in relationships requires speaking one's truth, even when it is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:06">[01:57:06]</a>. This includes being honest with parents about one's feelings, even if it causes them worry, as they want their child to be happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. Such transparency transforms relationships from one-sided, scripted interactions ("NPC" relationships) to two-sided, genuine connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

This is part of the [[navigating_selfidentity_and_relationships | navigating self-identity and relationships]] process. It is important to know that while doing "the right thing" or being "nice" can be a sacrifice, it is different from being driven by "should," which creates pressure and resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:12">[01:41:12]</a>. [[selflove_and_overcoming_challenges | Self-love and overcoming challenges]] often means accepting feelings like not wanting to do something, even if one chooses to do it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. Forgiveness is not something people are entitled to; true forgiveness comes from acceptance of the damage, not its erasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:44">[02:29:44]</a>.

### Meditation and Emotional Release
Meditation or chanting can serve as a "mental reset" and a tool for [[courage_and_selfreflection | self-reflection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:23">[02:51:23]</a>. It allows for the release of pent-up emotional "pressure," bringing subconscious feelings like exhaustion to the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:36">[02:53:36]</a>. This process helps open the "closet" of suppressed emotions, gradually allowing one to confront and accept them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:36">[02:53:36]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

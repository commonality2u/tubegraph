Charisma is not solely determined by physical attractiveness, as most people are of average or below-average attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While physical attractiveness accounts for about 10.5% of the variance in charisma, it is merely one of six dimensions, and not the most important one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Research, such as the paper "Generic Charisma: Conceptualization and Measurement," indicates that [[practicing_effective_communication_skills | communication skills]] are the most important aspect of charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Along with attracting admiration/inspiration and being honest/reliable, [[practicing_effective_communication_skills | communication skills]] contribute to approximately half of an individual's charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

To develop charisma beyond physical attractiveness, individuals should focus on three key learnable attributes: [[role_of_vision_and_vision_implementation_in_charisma | vision and vision implementation]], [[authenticity_in_personal_charisma | authenticity]], and [[techniques_for_effective_communication | communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Communication Style

[[improving_communication_style_for_charisma | Communication style]] is a crucial component of charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. It is built upon a foundation of a clear [[role_of_vision_and_vision_implementation_in_charisma | vision]] and [[authenticity_in_personal_charisma | authenticity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. When communicating, the goal is to clearly share authentic thoughts and one's [[role_of_vision_and_vision_implementation_in_charisma | vision]], rather than bragging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### Clarifying Communication through Writing

A key technique for clear communication is to [[practicing_effective_communication_skills | practice writing]] about topics before speaking about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. This process of writing, or verbalization, clarifies thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. By writing out thoughts, individuals can ensure that when they speak, their ideas are already formulated and clear, leading to more competent and impactful conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. This is because most people think and speak simultaneously, which can lead to less clear communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

Developing a clear [[improving_communication_style_for_charisma | communication style]] by [[practicing_effective_communication_skills | writing]] helps to naturally attract others, as they will perceive the individual as someone who can speak clearly, has a [[role_of_vision_and_vision_implementation_in_charisma | vision]], and is trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

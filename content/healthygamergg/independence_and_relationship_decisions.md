Navigating relationships often involves a balance between personal growth and partnership. One common dilemma arises when an individual feels a strong need for [[selfreliance_and_independence | independence]] and self-discovery, which can conflict with an otherwise positive relationship.

## The Pursuit of Independence
Yvonne, who describes herself as someone who typically tries to "run around and be there for everyone" and "make everyone happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, found herself facing a deeply personal challenge. She felt a profound need to understand herself outside of a relationship, something she had not experienced since she was 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

Having been in back-to-back relationships for nearly 14 years, she realized she had "never gotten the chance to be like [[selfreliance_and_independence | independent]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This led to "reoccurring thoughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a> about what her life would be like on her own, how she would "tackle problems on [her] own," and how she would "grow as a person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>, especially during her early twenties, a period she views as crucial for shaping one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The appeal of independence was not about seeking something specific, but rather a desire to experience life without always having someone else present, to "just know what it's like period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

## The Difficult Breakup
This burgeoning desire for [[selfreliance_and_independence | independence]] led to a difficult decision to end a seven-year relationship with a partner she considered "everything I would have wanted in someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. He was supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, funny, well-liked by her friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, and gave her "so much freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Despite being happy *with him* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, Yvonne felt a "strong need for independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a> for herself.

The breakup was particularly painful because it felt like a "missing puzzle piece" she needed to experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. She expressed that if she had stayed, she would have always wondered "what it would have been like to be on my own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, seeking to avoid a life of regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. The situation was described as tragic, as both parties loved each other but felt they had to be apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

### Navigating Selfishness and Fairness
Yvonne struggled with feelings of being "selfish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>, especially since her boyfriend did not want to break up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. She acknowledged that ending the relationship was "fair to me but not him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

It is suggested that while breaking up with someone who doesn't want to end the relationship because one is unhappy is selfish, it is also "completely okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. The key is to be "intentional and aware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a> of when one puts themselves first. While relationships should strive for overall fairness over time, it is acknowledged that they can be "frequently unfair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Yvonne's honesty about the unfairness to her ex-boyfriend, who did nothing wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>, is noted as impressive, demonstrating authenticity rather than trying to rationalize the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. She felt it would be dishonest to stay with him while harboring those feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

### The Fear of Regret
The decision highlighted the "conundrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a> of when to give in to the "fear of regret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a> and make a change, versus when to "conquer the fear of regret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a> and stick with what one has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. Yvonne felt her decision was "fairly important and somewhat reasonable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a> given her long history in relationships.

## Impact on Self-Identity
Yvonne's past experiences may have contributed to her current struggle with [[navigating_selfidentity_and_relationships | self-identity]]. She noted her uncertainty about how she sees herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, which may be linked to having "always sort of existed in relation to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. This constant "duo queueing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a> (a gaming metaphor) might have prevented her from understanding her own skills and identity outside of a partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. The pursuit of [[selfreliance_and_independence | independence]] was an attempt to fill this gap and truly discover herself.

Her journey reflects a conscious choice "not to live on autopilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. She actively thought about how to make her life different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>, moving away from merely living life passively like a "minion" in a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This intentionality, driven by a dislike for complaining without action, is a significant aspect of her personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

Recent trends indicate an unprecedented number of people quitting their jobs, often in a publicly spectacular, social media-driven manner, particularly evident on platforms like the anti-work subreddit [00:01:25]. This article explores the underlying psychological and evolutionary forces contributing to this phenomenon, offering insights from a theoretical scientific perspective [00:00:41].

## The Internet as a Great Equalizer
The internet is considered a significant equalizer, leveling the playing field between unequal groups [00:02:06]. Historically, major human innovations like the printing press (disseminating information) and gunpowder (equalizing physical power) brought about drastic societal changes [00:02:28]. The internet is posited as the third such equalizer, with its impact on information dissemination not yet fully understood [00:03:24].

Previously, individuals in small towns with "crappy jobs" had limited awareness of other employment options [00:03:39]. The internet, and specifically [[role_of_internet_and_social_media_in_employment | social media]], has broadened this awareness, allowing people to compare their situations and realize that "better things" or "better options" exist [00:03:53]. While social media has its dangers, it also serves as a tool for revealing better alternatives, which has been "devastating for certain employers" [00:04:15].

## Lack of Negative Selection Pressure on Employers
Employers, historically, have faced little "negative selection pressure" against poor practices [00:05:00]. This lack of consequences allowed them to operate without needing to prioritize employee satisfaction [00:05:17]. Unions emerged as a response to balance corporate power, but the internet has introduced another significant balancing force [00:05:27].

Corporations have benefited from the "ignorance" of their employees, essentially "preying on ignorance" [00:06:03]. Just as information dissemination has improved the quality of restaurants by allowing consumers to find better options, employees are now gravitating towards "better companies" and away from "worse companies" [00:06:14]. Many profitable corporations continued to exist by exploiting their employees' lack of awareness about other opportunities [00:07:00].

## The Impact of COVID-19
COVID-19 acted as a "blindfold coming off" for many employees, revealing several long-held assumptions to be untrue [00:07:14]:

### Debunking the Commute Necessity
For a long time, companies insisted employees be physically present in the office, leading to significant daily commutes (from five minutes to two hours) [00:07:30]. The pandemic demonstrated that commuting was often unnecessary, as work could be done remotely [00:08:19].

### Ending Geographical Predation
Previously, job options were geographically restricted, especially in "company towns" dominated by a single employer [00:08:39]. COVID-19 and the shift to remote work removed these geographical barriers, allowing individuals to seek employment in different states or even countries [00:08:58]. This mirrors corporations' long-standing practice of outsourcing jobs overseas for their benefit [00:09:44]. Now, employees are realizing they don't have to work for "crap jobs" when remote opportunities exist elsewhere [00:10:10].

### Re-evaluating Survival Needs and Priorities
The pandemic also prompted people to reconsider the "grind" mentality â€“ working long hours, commuting, and sacrificing present happiness for a distant retirement [00:10:27]. During COVID-19, many discovered they didn't need as much money as they thought and that an extra few thousand dollars a year was not worth an additional 15 hours of work per week [00:11:34]. This led to a re-questioning of priorities and a reduced willingness to sacrifice time for marginal financial gain [00:11:58].

## Evolutionary Theory and Selection Pressure
COVID-19 effectively placed a "selection pressure on jobs" [00:12:06]. Prior to this, corporate practices went "unchecked" because there were no environmental consequences [00:12:13]. According to the [[evolutionary_perspective_on_emotional_processing | theory of evolution]], practices that thrive in an environment without negative consequences will continue to propagate [00:12:21].

Now, workers are collectively "selecting for a particular kind of job and select[ing] against another kind of job" [00:12:40]. The perceived "labor shortage" is better described as a "wage shortage" or a shortage of desirable jobs, as labor exists but is unwilling to tolerate poor conditions [00:12:49]. Companies have become "bloated, profit-driven" due to the absence of these selection pressures [00:13:06].

### The 30/70 Rule and Corporate Excesses
Similar to game design or even play behavior among animals and children, a system needs to allow participants to "win at least 30% of the time" to keep them engaged [00:13:31]. If they lose more than 70% of the time, they stop playing [00:13:46]. For too long, companies have been "racking up w's without taking l's" [00:14:10]. This unchecked corporate excess, where the "wealth inequality is increasing," has led to a point where people are no longer willing to "put up with it anymore" [00:14:16].

## Corporate Psychological Mistakes
The primary psychological mistake employers make is grossly invalidating their workers' experiences [00:19:38]. When employees are labeled "lazy" or blamed for a "labor shortage," it's akin to punishing a misbehaving child by calling them "bad" or "stupid," which only exacerbates the problem [00:18:51]. This invalidation leads to employees acting out worse [00:20:50].

### PR Over Problem-Solving
Instead of addressing actual problems, companies often resort to hiring PR firms to "fix the perception of the problem" [00:20:05]. This approach signifies a fundamental failure to listen to employees and understand their concerns [00:20:23]. This strategy was effective previously because consumers and workers did not hold companies accountable for unethical practices (e.g., sweatshops, human rights abuses) [00:24:39].

### The Consequences of Invalidation
The continued invalidation of workers' experiences, coupled with blaming external factors like government handouts or laziness, prevents companies from addressing the root issues [00:21:13]. Companies now face two choices:
1.  Continue invalidating employees, leading to mass resignations and eventual closure [00:21:40]. This is often accompanied by an unwillingness to introspect or take responsibility, blaming external factors instead [00:21:50].
2.  Listen to employees, understand their needs, and make the workplace desirable [00:22:20].

While employees may always feel they could be "making more money" (a common aspect of [[psychological_effects_of_rejection_and_cognitive_biases | human psychology]], similar to how roommates feel they do the most dishes), a middle ground exists [00:27:32]. Employers should strive to fairly compensate and create a positive work environment, recognizing that high turnover indicates underlying issues [00:28:14].

## Shifting Employee Values and Corporate Responsibility
There's a noticeable shift in employee values, even at higher levels of work like investment banking and medicine [00:15:03]. Coveted jobs that once demanded extreme sacrifice are now seen as stepping stones, with people seeking to "gtfo as quickly as possible" [00:15:16]. Many are no longer willing to "work their asses off for 20 years" just to relax later in life [00:16:09]. This trend is leading to a "massive exodus" from demanding fields to "easier fields" [00:16:24].

Companies that recognize these changing values, such as Google, are more successful in retaining employees [00:16:48]. Google, for instance, provides amenities and flexibility, making employees "love working there" even if the pay might be slightly less than competitors [00:17:07]. This demonstrates that throwing money at the problem is not a perfect solution [00:18:02]. Employees increasingly seek "meaningful and impactful" work they can be proud of, rather than just large piles of money [00:18:26].

Companies that have historically exploited workers or relied on automation to cut jobs are now experiencing the reverse, with workers "automating" their own rebellion (e.g., spamming job applications) [00:25:27]. Rewarding ingenuity and addressing employee needs, rather than punishing them for finding efficiencies, is crucial for companies to adapt [00:26:21].

The current "anti-worker movement" is a culmination of long-standing corporate invalidation and a newfound employee awareness of alternative options and the cost of exploitation [00:26:41]. Until companies address the root problems, listen to their employees, and create fair, supportive environments, this trend will continue [00:27:20]. Some companies, like Costco, exemplify good employer practices, demonstrating that a positive work culture is achievable [00:34:33]. Ultimately, if employers expect loyalty and hard work, they must reciprocate by supporting their employees [00:31:55].

Individuals often find themselves struggling to find romantic partners, despite receiving abundant advice from various online sources such as YouTube, Reddit, and advice forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A common piece of advice given is to "work on yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, "not try too hard," and "just be yourself" or "be the best version of yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The belief is that if one focuses on self-improvement, opening themselves up to the universe, the relationship will naturally come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## The Frustration of "Working on Yourself"

Many highly motivated individuals embark on this self-improvement journey, spending months or even years working on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. They might get in better physical shape, achieve career promotions, or attend therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. However, often after a year or two of dedicated effort, they find themselves still without a relationship, going on dates that lead to cancellations or no text-backs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This lack of results can lead to a cycle of [[overcoming_hopelessness_in_dating | despair]] and doubt regarding the effectiveness of the advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The question arises: "Does this stuff actually work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

## Understanding Underlying Barriers: Core Beliefs and Perceptions

The difficulty in finding relationships can be linked to deeply ingrained "core beliefs" (or *samskaras* in yogic philosophy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. These beliefs are mental "formulas" our brains create to make sense of the world, often based on past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For example, a child frequently yelled at might conclude, "I'm a bad person," which becomes an adaptive belief to cope with their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

These core beliefs, such as "I am unlovable" or "I will be alone forever," lead to assumptions and "automatic thoughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. For instance, if a text isn't immediately returned, an automatic thought might be, "she doesn't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Undigested emotional experiences from the past, often referred to as "relationship baggage," fuel these assumptions, carrying over negative patterns from previous relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### The Impact on Perception

Crucially, core beliefs not only shape thoughts but also perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. If one believes they are unlovable, they will amplify negative signals and reduce positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This cognitive bias means that positive information tends to be filtered out, while negative information is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### The Internet's Amplification

The internet exacerbates this problem by also amplifying negative information and reducing positive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Online communities for relationships are typically spaces where people discuss their struggles and problems, not where people in happy relationships "chain post" about their joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Posts about successful relationships are often downvoted as "bragging" or "arrogant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This creates a skewed perception that finding a relationship is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## The Missing Timeline

The biggest piece of missing information from most dating advice is the timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Everyone tells you what to do, but no one tells you how long it will take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This leads to frustration and giving up after a year of effort, much like expecting to get a job after only a year of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### The Reality of the Timeline

While personalized, the advice "it works" is true; it just takes a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. It can take three, four, five, or even seven years to see results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. For those with no social skills and little life direction, a realistic expectation is at least five years of consistent self-work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This involves:
*   Developing social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   Becoming professionally and financially independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   Getting into physical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   Taking care of mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

Setting a long-term target, like five years, helps manage expectations and reduces anxiety, paradoxically making success more likely when not actively "trying" to find a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Many successful relationships begin when one is not actively looking, but rather focusing on personal enjoyment and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Being "out of your head" and focusing on the other person through empathic connection, instead of one's own anxious self, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

## Managing Resentment and Seeking Support

Feelings of hopelessness and resentment during this process are completely justified and must be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. Projecting resentment into the dating sphere is self-sabotaging and reinforces negative core beliefs like "people don't care about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

### Coaching vs. Therapy

While therapists typically focus on questions and exploring underlying issues, coaching programs are designed to help individuals achieve specific goals, such as finding a romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. Therapy often operates under a medical model, treating existing conditions like relationship problems or mental disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Coaching, however, aims to understand an individual's goals, roadblocks (including *samskaras* or past emotional baggage that cause resentment), and then create a path to achieve those goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

Coaching can help manage emotions, dismantle core beliefs, and provide a plan to re-enter dating with renewed hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. It focuses on practical skills like setting boundaries and understanding self-sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Unlike some traditional therapy models, coaching programs often actively collect feedback and iterate on their methods to ensure effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

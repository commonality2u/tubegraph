[[understanding_alexithymia_and_its_effects_on_emotional_awareness | Alexithymia]] is defined as the inability to experience one's internal emotional state, often likened to an "emotional color blindness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This lack of awareness of internal feelings can lead to a variety of problems, including those related to addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Alexithymia and Addiction

[[emotional_regulation_in_addiction_recovery | Alexithymia]] is a common factor in many psychological problems, and it specifically exacerbates issues like addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>. Individuals who are alexithymic are more prone to addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. In clinical experience, people in addiction recovery often report relapses as "out of the blue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a>. However, upon closer examination, it's often revealed that subtle emotional stressors were building up over time, eventually becoming overwhelming and leading to relapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. These individuals are "colorblind" to these internal emotional pressures, believing everything is fine even as problems accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>.

The unifying element across all addictions is that they serve as a means of [[the_science_of_emotionfocused_coping | emotional coping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:01">[02:49:01]</a>. Substances or behavioral addictions (like technology use) manipulate emotions by either mellowing them out, activating them, or dulling emotional circuitry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.

## Impact on Emotional Coping Mechanisms

A key finding is that the more an individual is able to identify what they are feeling in the moment, the less likely they are to use a substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:01">[02:44:01]</a>. Conversely, individuals vulnerable to addiction often have a lower level of emotional awareness, and their brains may even be wired differently in terms of emotional circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>.

### The Challenge of "Struggling"
When people report "struggling," it's often an umbrella term for negative emotions they cannot identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:01">[02:51:01]</a>. For example, instead of saying "I'm terrified of asking my boss for a raise because I don't want to be perceived as greedy," an alexithymic person might simply say "I'm struggling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:01">[02:53:01]</a>. Without this specific awareness, it's impossible to develop targeted, healthy coping mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:01">[02:45:01]</a>. If one isn't aware of feeling anxious, they won't consider meditating to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>.

### Technology's Influence
The increasing use of technology, such as social media and video games, suppresses emotional circuitry in the brain, including the limbic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>. This chronic suppression, particularly during critical developmental periods like adolescence, hinders the development of internal emotional understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. As technology offers an easy escape from emotions, individuals don't learn to develop them, leading to a generation that is more internally numb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>.

### Solutions and Interventions
While [[understanding_alexithymia_and_its_effects_on_emotional_awareness | alexithymia]] has been classified as a personality trait, there is clinical evidence that it is not fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:01">[03:40:01]</a>. Programs focusing on internal [[therapeutic_and_emotional_processing_strategies | emotional awareness]], such as meditation, have shown success in reducing relapses in individuals with addictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:01">[04:00:01]</a>. By increasing emotional awareness, individuals may initially feel worse as they acknowledge negative emotions, but this awareness enables them to seek help and develop healthier coping strategies, ultimately improving long-term mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:01">[04:20:01]</a>. Recognizing and understanding one's emotions is crucial for effectively managing them and preventing issues like addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:01">[04:43:01]</a>.

Osteopathic medicine emphasizes that the mind and body are interconnected, not two separate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This perspective highlights the importance of understanding the [[mindbody_connection | mind-body connection]] for overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Core Tenets of Osteopathic Practice
Dr. Mike, a board-certified family medicine osteopathic doctor (DO), explains that the premise of DO education, compared to MD education, is a holistic, patient-forward approach to healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This means addressing not just symptoms, but also underlying risk factors in a patient's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT)
In addition to a patient-first philosophy, DOs learn an extra hands-on technique called Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. OMT is described as a therapy and a way of thinking that uses the body's own mechanisms to help patients with pain or dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

An example given is treating recurrent tension headaches caused by neck spasms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. An osteopathic exam would consider factors like work ergonomics, monitor placement, and then use hands-on techniques to address muscle dysfunction and assess joints above and below the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

OMT utilizes the body's innate reflexes to induce relaxation and increase range of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. For instance, pushing against a stationary object activates muscles in an isometric contraction, which the mind naturally encourages to relax to conserve energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This principle is used in OMT to relax muscle spasms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

#### OMT and Yoga
Dr. Mike draws a connection between OMT principles and [[balance_in_life_through_yoga_and_mindfulness | yoga]], noting that yoga's positions often involve isometric contractions that induce relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. He also highlights the importance of eccentric contractions (muscle slowly lengthening while contracting) in [[balance_in_life_through_yoga_and_mindfulness | yoga]] for muscle rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Beyond muscle work, [[balance_in_life_through_yoga_and_mindfulness | yoga]]'s superiority often comes from its focus on proper breathing mechanics and the [[role_of_mindfulness_and_meditation | mindfulness]] component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing helps control the body's sympathetic and parasympathetic states, directly influencing the HPA axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Mind-Body Connection in Pain Management
Dr. Mike observed a strong relationship between the mental health state and physical pain in his patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. He found that often the mental health state *preceded* the physical pain, and once the mental health was addressed, the physical pain subsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

He references Dr. John Sarno's work and book, "The Divided Mind," which explored how treating repressed childhood or current negative life situations yielded better results for chronic pain patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Dr. Sarno's research proposed that in stressful states, the body might limit blood flow to certain areas, using physical pain as a distraction from overwhelming mental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This theory aligns with concepts seen in self-injurious behavior, where physical pain serves as a distraction from intense emotional feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

Dr. Mike emphasizes the neurochemical connections in the body, where neurotransmitters and hormones are impacted by stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. A hyper-sympathetic state can lead to tightened muscles, decreased circulation, and limited range of motion, propagating physical injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. As a family medicine physician, he broaches mental health discussions with patients, even when they present with physical symptoms, and refers them to specialists when appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

## Osteopathic vs. Allopathic (MD) Education
In the United States, DOs are fully licensed medical doctors who can practice across any specialty and get board-certified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Historically, there was some stigma against osteopathic physicians, perhaps seen as "too alternative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This stigma stemmed from the fact that in some countries, osteopathy practitioners are not fully licensed medical doctors and only perform OMT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

However, in the U.S., DO and MD education and residency programs have become increasingly merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Dr. Mike's residency program trained MDs and DOs together, leading to a blending of principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. While MDs traditionally focused intensely on physiology and pathophysiology, DOs have a stronger emphasis on psychosocial components and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. DOs gain early hands-on experience through OMT practice on classmates, which helps with physical exams and patient interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. The MD curriculum is also increasingly incorporating the holistic approach, narrowing the differences between the two degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Professional Application
Dr. Mike's personal journey, influenced by his father's immigration and re-entry into medicine as a DO, instilled a holistic perspective and strong morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. His father's motto, "going through I can't" (meaning pushing through struggles), profoundly shaped his resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

He views patient interactions as continuous learning opportunities, constantly seeking to improve as a doctor and explore unanswered questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This curiosity extends to understanding the "why" behind medical treatments, such as why antibiotics are given for strep throat (to prevent complications like rheumatic fever) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

### Challenges with Social Media and Burnout
Despite his success and drive, Dr. Mike admits to experiencing burnout, where he derived less joy from activities that once pleased him, had disturbed sleep, and high anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. This was largely due to tying his self-worth and happiness to social media metrics, an extrinsic reward system perpetuated by algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. He realized that constantly trying to "attack irrational thoughts" through self-applied cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was paradoxically causing him to relive negative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

Seeking professional help, he learned the importance of "disconnecting" and not constantly refreshing his feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. This "hiding" or "disconnecting" was, in fact, a positive coping mechanism, rather than a negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. He recognized that while comparing his struggles to others' hardships (like losing his mother to cancer) can offer perspective, it can also lead to invalidating his own suffering, which contributes to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

### Pursuit of Fulfillment and [[Mindfulness and its benefits | Mindfulness]]
Dr. Mike defines fulfillment as a state where he feels satisfied with his accomplishments if today were his last day on earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>. These accomplishments include good relationships, ethical conduct, and helping the world, not just external metrics like follower counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. He distinguishes this from momentary happiness, which is transient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.

His journey also includes struggles with [[role_of_mindfulness_and_meditation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:39">[01:48:39]</a>. He admits to "failing" at traditional [[role_of_mindfulness_and_meditation | mindfulness]] practices because his highly active mind needs a more demanding focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:58">[01:52:58]</a>. This led to the concept of a "powerful alumna" (Sanskrit for support) in [[role_of_mindfulness_and_meditation | meditation]], where a technique is intensive enough to fully occupy the mind, like alternate nostril breathing or balancing with eyes closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:52">[02:13:52]</a>. This reflects the osteopathic principle of finding what truly works for the individual, even if it's unconventional, by providing the mind with the "treat" it needs to eventually learn stillness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:36">[02:15:36]</a>.

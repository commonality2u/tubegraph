[[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | Self-worth]] is a critical component for healthy dating and relationships, influencing not only personal well-being but also the dynamics with partners and their families.

## The Role of Confidence in Parental Approval
A person's confidence in their chosen partner can significantly influence how their parents perceive that relationship. When an individual expresses strong assurance about their partner, parents are often more at ease and tend to accept the partner more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This contrasts with situations where a person might be insecure or actively seeking parental approval, which could lead to disapproval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> "Having confidence and faith in your partner first kind of makes them feel more at eased." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

This confidence extends to disagreements or hesitations from parents regarding a partner's career, religion, or background. If an individual confidently asserts their choice, parents are often more likely to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## [[impact_of_selfesteem_and_selfworth_on_dating | Dating Someone Who Lacks Self-Worth]]
Approaching a relationship with someone who lacks [[struggles_with_selfworth_and_selfesteem | self-worth]] is complex. While one perspective suggests avoiding such relationships, especially at their inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, another views it as an opportunity for growth through a stable relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

### Expectations and Responsibilities
When dating someone with [[understanding_and_addressing_selfesteem_issues | self-esteem issues]], it's crucial to define roles:
*   **Not a Therapist** You are not their therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. Their journey to gaining [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | self-worth]] is ultimately their own responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Supportive Environment** You can create a supportive environment and show them their worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Internal Source** True confidence and [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | self-worth]] must come from within; no one can "make you feel good about yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
*   **Mutual Growth** A healthy relationship involves both individuals growing together, not one constantly "pulling" the other up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. If a partner isn't doing their part to address their [[struggles_with_selfworth_and_selfesteem | self-worth]], it's reasonable to have a conversation about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

The appropriateness of dating someone with low [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | self-worth]] can also depend on age; in early twenties, it may be more common as people are still figuring themselves out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

## [[building_selfworth_and_battling_negative_selfbeliefs | Building Self-Worth and Addressing Personal Issues]]
Many individuals struggle with a lack of [[selfworth_and_battling_negative_selfbeliefs | self-acceptance]] and [[selfworth_and_battling_negative_selfbeliefs | self-validation]].

### Strategies for Internal Confidence
1.  **Trace the Loss of Confidence**: Identify when and why your confidence was lost. Often, it's due to unfair treatment or traumatic experiences, not inherent flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:20">[03:07:20]</a>. Reflect on whether feeling a certain way is a "logical or like good conclusion" given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:10">[03:08:10]</a>.
2.  **Seek Non-Judgmental Environments**: Confidence is often shattered by human judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:38">[03:08:38]</a>. Spending time in nature can help, as nature does not judge or care about external factors like appearance, social media validation, or job status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11">[03:09:11]</a>.
3.  **Focus on Internal Growth**: Engage in activities that build internal value and make you proud of yourself. This could involve physical fitness, personal discipline, or learning new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:48">[03:57:48]</a>.
4.  **Acknowledge Progress**: Every failure or difficult experience can be viewed as "leveling up," increasing your chances of success in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a>. Simply having the self-awareness to understand your patterns is a significant step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:26">[02:46:26]</a>.
5.  **Address Neediness**: If overthinking and neediness stem from an internal "hunger" for external validation, recognize that this validation is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:07">[02:47:07]</a>. The long-term solution involves understanding "why are you hungry in the first place" and "where did you lose the idea that you have value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:18">[02:48:18]</a>. Working on this internal source of value will make relationships easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:33">[02:48:33]</a>.
6.  **Utilize a Sounding Board**: A therapist, friend, or family member can serve as an intermediary to help process feelings and guide appropriate actions without internalizing judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:44">[02:48:44]</a>.

## Self-Worth in Challenging Relationship Situations
### Feeling Unimportant
If you suddenly feel unimportant to someone you emotionally connected with, consider that it may not be about you. Often, the other person might be dealing with significant personal issues or lacking the "bandwidth" to engage, which has nothing to do with your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>. However, if a person consistently blows you off even after direct communication, it may be time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>.

### Leaving a Bad Relationship
[[understanding_selfblame_and_responsibility_in_relationship_failures | Don't fall into the trap]] of staying in a bad relationship simply because of the time invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>. If a relationship requires constant "work" from only one partner and is based on fear (e.g., fear of being alone) rather than genuine love, it is often not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>.

> "Fear is not a good reason to stay in a relationship." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>

### Dating Someone Who is Already in a Relationship
Engaging in a relationship with someone who is already married or committed can be detrimental to one's [[sense_of_selfvalue_and_intrinsic_worth | self-worth]]. Such relationships often involve one person providing what the other is "missing" in their primary relationship, leading to an incomplete and potentially exploitative dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:32">[03:39:32]</a>. Moving on from such a situation requires exploring the internal "hunger" or reasons that led to seeking such a relationship in the first place, and addressing those underlying needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:08">[03:41:08]</a>.

### The "Nice Guy" Fallacy
A common misconception is that "nice guys finish last." However, the distinction lies between being "nice" and being "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:10">[03:54:10]</a>. Niceness can be a superficial front, whereas goodness comes from internal character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:43">[03:54:43]</a>. Focusing on being a genuinely good person, rather than just playing "nice," is key for healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>.

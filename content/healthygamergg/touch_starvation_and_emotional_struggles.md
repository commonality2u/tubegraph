Touch starvation, also known as skin hunger or touch deprivation, is a widespread issue where individuals experience a lack of physical contact and affection, leading to significant emotional and physiological distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This phenomenon is not an isolated experience and affects people across genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Even neurodivergent individuals, who may dislike being touched, can still long for touch and find themselves in a challenging situation where their body needs contact but their somatosensory cortex prevents them from engaging in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Societal Indicators

Current societal trends indicate a growing problem with lack of human connection:
*   A loneliness epidemic is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Indicators of mental illness are worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   The percentage of people who have never been in a romantic relationship is rising astronomically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   The percentage of people who have never had sexual relations is also rising astronomically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   The number of people with zero friends is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Touch starvation has profound physiological consequences, extending beyond psychological distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Oxytocin Release
Oxytocin, often called the "bonding hormone," is released through physical touch like cuddling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This hormone helps to calm the nervous system, reduce stress hormone response, and is inversely proportional to stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. A hug physiologically makes a person feel better, creating a loving bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Broader Health Impacts
Studies on touch deprivation, historically conducted with orphans, now find comparable subjects in the general population due to its prevalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Lack of touch can lead to:
*   Changes in cardiovascular outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Worsening diabetes, indicated by changes in hemoglobin A1c <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Increases in cortisol levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Worsening mental health parameters, including depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Pain Attenuation
Human contact can significantly reduce the perception of pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. A study involving electrical shocks showed that individuals holding hands with a stranger or, more effectively, a loved one, experienced a blunted and attenuated brain response to pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This suggests human contact literally makes the experience of life less painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Contributing Factors

The current state of touch starvation is attributed to two primary societal shifts:

### The Rise of Independence
Society has increasingly prioritized independence, viewing interdependence as a weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This philosophy leads individuals to believe problems are either personal responsibilities ("fix it") or societal faults, effectively absolving individuals of the responsibility for caring for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Needs traditionally met by community, like meditation, are now outsourced to individual solutions or institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Technology as a Substitute
Technology has positioned itself to meet human needs without requiring face-to-face interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This includes apps for meeting people, ordering food, or even requesting a ride without conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The aversion to human interaction has progressed to a point where simply talking to a stranger can be seen as inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Substitutes for Connection:** Instead of physical hugs, people send emojis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. There are virtual girlfriend apps, human-shaped pillows, and sexual devices that act as substitutes for genuine relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Professional Boundaries
In professions like psychiatry, strict rules exist regarding physical touch with patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. While some boundaries are important for patient safety and ethical practice, the overarching culture discourages touch, even when an empathic response might involve a hug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Addressing Touch Starvation

Solving this widespread issue requires a fundamental shift in perspective and action:
*   **Cautious Use of Technology:** Technology should be used as a tool to fulfill human needs, not as a complete substitute for human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Personal Responsibility:** Individuals must stop blaming others or society for problems and instead accept personal responsibility for caring for human beings around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Lowering the Threshold for Contact:** The current "hurdle" for receiving human contact, where people might need to make a public viral appeal just for a hug, needs to be significantly lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Giving and Receiving Care:** While no one is entitled to another's sacrifice, society must collectively step up to give and receive care, even when it might be personally challenging or painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Asking "Do you need a hug today?" is a simple way to initiate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

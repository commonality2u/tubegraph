Some individuals with ADHD find certain types of noise, such as white noise or brown noise, helpful for focus. While these phenomena are sometimes discussed on social media platforms like TikTok as scientifically proven, the scientific validity of this approach is worth exploring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## The Optimal Stimulus Theory for ADHD
Research indicates that white noise can indeed assist individuals with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This effect is rooted in the idea that ADHD symptoms fluctuate based on the environment's level of stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

A core theory suggests that there is an "optimal level of function" for individuals with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. In low-stimulus environments—where there's less sensory input—ADHD symptoms tend to worsen, leading to increased fidgeting and difficulty paying attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. To compensate for this under-stimulation, individuals with ADHD may self-stimulate by moving around, making noises, or exploring their surroundings, attempting to reach their optimal stimulus level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Providing appropriate external stimuli, such as white noise, can actually reduce these ADHD behaviors and improve focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## The Impact of Overstimulation
Conversely, an environment with too much stimulus can be equally detrimental for individuals with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. When bombarded with an excessive amount of sensory input, ADHD symptoms can worsen because the brain struggles to cope and focus on a single task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of maintaining an optimal "stimulus balance" for individuals with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Strategies like cleaning and de-cluttering a room can help by removing distracting stimuli when someone is over-stimulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

### [[the_impact_of_technology_on_adhd_symptoms | The Impact of Technology on ADHD Symptoms]]
Modern technology has a significant, often crippling, impact on individuals with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Unlike past environments where under-stimulation might lead to self-initiated movement, the easy access and addictive nature of technology make it simple for individuals with ADHD to become caught in a cycle of overstimulation for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Social media platforms, for instance, constantly bombard users with multiple sources of stimuli (e.g., recommended videos, comments), catering to shifting attention and making it difficult to disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. This dynamic often exacerbates ADHD symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

## Scientific Basis
The observations regarding stimulus balance in ADHD are supported by scientific research.
*   A paper examining the "Neuropsychological and neurophysiological effects from white noise in children with and without ADHD" shows preliminary evidence for white noise's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.
*   The **Optimal Stimulation Theory** and the **Moderate Brain Arousal Model** have been studied in the context of ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Top-down versus bottom-up attentional control studies** also provide insights into how attention is managed and affected by environmental stimuli in individuals with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, maintaining an optimal stimulus balance is crucial for improving focus in individuals with ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

Tiredness is often perceived as a negative state, purely physiological, and something to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. However, it can be understood as an emotion and an adaptive mechanism that serves a crucial function in the brain's energy management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## [[understanding_tiredness_as_an_emotion | Understanding Tiredness as an Emotion]]

While commonly associated with lack of sleep or physical exertion, tiredness can manifest suddenly, even after adequate rest and nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This challenges the notion of tiredness as solely a [[physiological_causes_of_tiredness_and_energy_management | physiological state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The experience of "feeling tired" suggests its nature as an emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Emotions, including fear, anxiety, or lust, have both psychological and physiological components, providing information to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. Thus, [[the_mental_and_physical_aspects_of_tiredness | tiredness is an emotion]] â€“ a signal from the body and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

## Tiredness as an Adaptive Mechanism

The brain created tiredness as an adaptive mechanism to help individuals avoid "useless work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. It's a response to a perception of a high workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. In evolutionary terms, if a task required significant effort with a low chance of success, the brain would prevent the expenditure of energy on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Tiredness essentially functions as an "energy conservation strategy," signaling "don't do it, don't bother, don't try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. It discourages investing energy in long-term, questionable endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Perception of Workload and Success

The brain evaluates tasks based on perceived workload and probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. For example, tasks like paying taxes or writing a dissertation often feel overwhelmingly large and endless, leading the brain to calculate that the effort required is too high for visible or immediate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. When the brain estimates a high workload with unclear chances of success or progress, it evokes tiredness to prevent energy waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. This is analogous to a mountain climber deciding not to ascend if they perceive the summit as unattainable, preventing wasted effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

## Tiredness in Modern Society

While effective in a primitive environment, this ancient mechanism conflicts with modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Tasks like paying taxes or finishing a dissertation are unavoidable and necessary, yet our brains still perceive them as requiring immense, potentially unrewarding effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. The perceived difficulty and lack of immediate completion trigger tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

Tiredness can also be triggered by social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Receiving a phone call from a demanding family member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   Encountering solicitors on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   Feeling drained by difficult family gatherings where one cannot meet others' emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   The thought of dating someone when there's a lack of genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

In these scenarios, tiredness acts as a defense mechanism, discouraging engagement in activities that the brain perceives as emotionally draining or unfulfilling, thus preventing a "waste of energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_overcome_feelings_of_tiredness | Strategies to Overcome Feelings of Tiredness]]

To overcome tiredness, it's crucial to understand why it arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Since emotions are information, tiredness is a signal from the body and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. When feeling tired, ask:
1.  "What is my body telling me not to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>
2.  "Why is my body telling me not to do it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>
3.  "How would I feel if I were to do the thing that makes me feel tired?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>

Often, the mind incorrectly calculates that even a small amount of progress won't feel good because there's still so much left to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. For example, starting a dissertation might feel pointless if there are 100 chapters to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.

By critically evaluating this calculation, one can recognize when the brain is disincentivizing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Productivity techniques such as **chunking large, abstract tasks into smaller, manageable pieces** are effective because they redefine the "target" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. If the goal is to read one chapter instead of 100, completing that one chapter feels like a worthwhile trade and reduces the feeling of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. By understanding that taking action often *does* lead to feeling good and making progress, the brain can adjust its energy investment calculation, reducing the feeling of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.

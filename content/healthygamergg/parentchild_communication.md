Effective communication between parents and children is crucial for fostering understanding, building trust, and navigating challenges such as technology use and academic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. A common issue observed in society is a disconnect between parents and their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, often exacerbated by the pervasive presence of digital devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## The Challenge of Screen Time and Communication

A mother, Layla, shares her experience with her 14-year-old son, whose screen time significantly increased [[Challenges of Parenting During the Pandemic | since the pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Her son now spends approximately four to four and a half hours on weekdays and all day on weekends using his phone, Xbox, and computer, primarily for social media like Snapchat and TikTok, and phone calls with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Layla is concerned this excessive usage affects their relationship and his academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Layla's ideal "healthy relationship with technology" for her son involves him actively engaging in physical activities like walking, hiking, or playing outside with friends or family, and doing chores or pursuing creative hobbies like drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. When she attempts to encourage these activities, she often faces resistance, leading to arguments or her resorting to [[Teaching Restraint Versus Restriction in Parenting | turning off the internet or pausing his devices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. She expresses a desire for her son to independently manage his time rather than being constantly policed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Identifying Communication Gaps

A key issue in parent-child interactions can be the way directives are phrased:

*   **Orders disguised as requests:** Layla believes her son *has* to do his homework when she says "you need to do your homework," but her underlying desire to avoid sounding dictatorial sometimes leads her to use softer phrasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This inconsistency can confuse a child who may interpret "please do this" as an option to refuse, rather than a non-negotiable instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. For clear [[Healthy communication in relationships | communication]], it's important to be consistent: if it's an order, communicate it as such; if it's a request, acknowledge the possibility of refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Accusations disguised as questions:** When a parent asks a question like "if it's important [why don't you do it]?" it can be perceived by the child as an accusation, leading them to shut down or give short, defensive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This approach makes the child feel attacked and ashamed, hindering genuine dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Trust and Understanding Between Parents and Children

To bridge communication gaps and improve [[Parentchild dynamics affecting dysthymia | parent-child dynamics]], a shift from telling to understanding is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

*   **Ask the "next question":** Instead of immediately correcting a child's statement or opinion, try to understand their underlying perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. If a child says, "there's nothing else to do" besides screen time, instead of saying "that's wrong" and listing activities, ask "why isn't he motivated for that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. This approach aims to uncover the child's true reasons and motivations, which the parent might not be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
    *   Examples of such questions include:
        *   "Help me understand why you resist me so much, as these things seem important to you and you seem to enjoy them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>
        *   "How important is school to you? Do you want to do well in school?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>
        *   "Why is school important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>
        *   "Do you want me to force you to do your homework?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>
        *   "What's boring about school?" or "When did school become boring?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>
    *   Asking questions the parent doesn't know the answer to is key to uncovering the child's true perspective and the "fundamental disconnect" in viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge and explore**: When a child provides an answer, even if it seems "wrong" to the parent, the goal is not to immediately invalidate it, but to understand it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. When a child shares an opinion and the response is "that's wrong," they will likely stop communicating openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.
*   **Build an alliance**: Instead of "dragging" the child to the parent's side, parents should aim to recruit the child as an ally in solving problems together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. By explaining the parent's situation and feelings, the child can begin to understand the parent's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This turns it into "a problem you and I have to solve together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.
*   **Let the child articulate their values**: By continuing to ask "why" questions, parents can help their child articulate what they truly care about and what they value in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. This process allows the child to surface their own understanding, rather than being lectured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.
*   **Address underlying issues**: Sometimes, a child's resistance or excessive screen time might stem from deeper issues, such as [[Communication based bullying | bullying at school]], body image concerns, or difficulty making friends in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. Asking questions can uncover these factors.
*   **Manage parental emotions**: Parents' unaddressed emotions, such as frustration or fear about their child's future, can inadvertently be communicated through tone or subtle cues, even when saying "good job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. This emotional undercurrent can prevent genuine positive reinforcement and make the child feel that compliance doesn't truly satisfy the parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
*   **Give the child a voice in boundaries**: Instead of imposing rules, involve the child in the process of setting limits, giving them "representation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>. This helps the child understand that limits are set not just because the parent says so, but because they support the child's own stated goals and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

## Conclusion

The digital age demands a new sophistication in [[Importance of Communication Between Parents and Children | parent-child communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. By adopting a communication style focused on asking open-ended questions, understanding the child's perspective, and building an alliance, parents can move from simply forcing compliance to fostering genuine understanding and self-management in their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. This approach empowers parents to [[managing_parental_support | support their children]] in navigating the complexities of the modern world effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.

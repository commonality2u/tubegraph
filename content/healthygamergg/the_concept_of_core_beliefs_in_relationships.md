Core beliefs are fundamental assumptions individuals hold about themselves, others, and the world, deeply influencing perceptions and actions, especially in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Origin and Formation of Core Beliefs

The concept of core beliefs was largely coined by Aaron Beck, while thousands of years ago, yogis referred to similar constructs as "samskars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Our brains, as they navigate the world, strive to make sense of experiences by forming conclusions or "formulas" that simplify complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

For example, a child frequently yelled at might conclude, "I'm not a good person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This conclusion can be adaptive; if behaving "badly" (by not excelling) reduces parental jealousy and associated pain, the child learns to conform to negative expectations, making the "I'm a bad person" belief a core belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Core Beliefs and Their Manifestations
Core beliefs, such as "I am unlovable" or "I will be alone forever," form adaptations that shape an individual's rules for living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. These rules, in turn, spawn "automatic thoughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. For instance, if a text isn't immediately returned, an automatic thought might be, "Oh, she doesn't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

From a yogic perspective, an undigested emotional experience "sinks down and goes dormant," becoming a samskara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. When triggered, this dormant emotion and its associated thoughts are applied to the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This concept aligns with what is commonly known as "relationship baggage"—emotions, patterns, and assumptions carried over from past relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. For example, if a past partner's unresponsiveness led to an affair, a current partner's brief unavailability might trigger immediate thoughts of cheating, even without present reason for distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Impact on Relationships and Dating

When entering the dating pool, it's crucial to understand one's beliefs about [[role_of_mindset_in_finding_relationships | finding someone]], being lovable, worthy, and deserving of a good relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Beyond self-worth, individuals may also hold "intermediate beliefs" that external factors are preventing them from having a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. These can manifest as adaptive beliefs, such as concerns about "sexual marketplace value," which may compensate for a deeper fear of being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### Core Beliefs Shape Perceptions
A crucial, often undervalued aspect of core beliefs is their [[the_impact_of_beliefs_on_perceptions_and_relationships | influence on perceptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. If an individual believes they are unlovable, their mind will amplify negative signals and reduce positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This cognitive bias means that positive information tends to be filtered out, while negative information is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### The Internet's Amplification
The internet significantly exacerbates this cognitive bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Online platforms like Reddit, Discord, or YouTube tend to amplify negative information about relationships while reducing positive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Communities for people in healthy relationships are scarce because individuals in fulfilling partnerships generally don't feel the need to post about their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Conversely, posts about successful relationships are often downvoted as "bragging" or "arrogant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This environment reinforces the perception that finding a relationship is impossible or that advice doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

For someone struggling to find a relationship, seeing many negative examples online can reinforce a core belief like, "I'm no good and no one will ever want me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## Addressing Core Beliefs and Resentment

While the advice to "work on yourself" is common, its effectiveness can be doubted because the timeline for results is rarely communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. People work on themselves for months or years without immediate romantic success and may lose heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The pursuit of a romantic partner often works, but it can take a long time—three, four, five, or even seven years, much like opening a "loot box" where the odds are unknown, but persistence is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. Setting a long-term target, like five years, can reduce immediate expectations and allow for natural growth and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

A critical aspect of [[understanding_and_changing_relationship_patterns | changing relationship patterns]] is managing resentment that arises from prolonged struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Feeling hopeless and resentful is justified, but this resentment must be dealt with *outside* the dating sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. When resentment enters dating interactions, it sabotages efforts, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that reinforces negative core beliefs like "people don't care about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Projecting resentment can make it difficult for someone to fall in love with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

Managing these emotions can involve seeking professional help, such as a therapist or coach, or discussing them with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. While therapists typically don't directly facilitate finding a partner, focusing on the patient's internal experience and obstacles, coaching programs can help identify and dismantle samskaras (core beliefs) and resentment, process emotions, and create plans for re-engaging with dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. This approach aims to provide guidance and facilitation to help individuals understand their values, motivations, roadblocks, and goals, enabling them to make forward progress in navigating relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

The way individuals perceive the world, form opinions, and engage in political discourse can be profoundly shaped by their [[impact_of_childhood_and_upbringing_on_mental_health_and_behaviors | childhood and upbringing]], as well as their personal and social environments [[role_of_personal_and_social_environment | [01:35:39]]] [[impact_of_childhood_and_past_experiences | [01:35:32]]]. Experiences, particularly challenging ones, can foster rigid belief systems and influence how one interacts with those holding differing views.

## The Case of "Jimmy from Philly"

Jimmy from Philly, a frequent caller to David Pakman's show who often expresses strong and controversial opinions, offers a case study in how personal [[role_of_personal_experiences_in_shaping_mental_perspective | experiences]] mold one's worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Childhood and Early Experiences
Jimmy describes himself as a "happy-go-lucky" and "energetic" child who used to skip down the street in Philadelphia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This behavior led to him being made fun of by other kids, which he states "taught me how to come back with snappy witty responses to insults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. He stopped skipping and "started being a comedian" in response to being called "gay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>, learning to "toughen up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

As a teenager, Jimmy began using drugs and committing crimes for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. His mother, struggling with her own mental health issues (manic depressive, hospitalized twice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>, placed him in a boy's vocational school at age 13, and later a stricter facility, Saint Gabe's, through the court system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. He initially felt abandoned and hated his mother for these decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. He recalls a positive experience where a military academy commander listened to his desire not to be a cadet, which he found to be a rare instance of someone having his back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

Jimmy's view on himself is that he is not a victim, but rather a person "shaped by their experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. He believes that one can either become a victim and stay angry/depressed or "turn that shit around" and "make lemons out of lemonade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. He credits Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and sponsoring others for helping him overcome past hatred and self-centeredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. He specifically mentions crying at his mother's grave at 38 and never "looked ill" of her again, understanding she did her best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

### Political and Social Beliefs
Jimmy holds strong political and social views, often expressing homophobia, transphobia, and racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He attributes his opinions to "believing his eyes and ears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a> and finding humor in situations others might deem offensive, stating, "a man in a dress that says it all... this shit is funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. He believes people should be ready to take jokes if they want to be accepted as normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, and that political correctness ("commies") is "destroying comedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

He expresses anger at what he perceives as attempts to force him to accept "delusions," particularly regarding gender identity, stating, "you're not going to force me to address you as a woman when you're clearly a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. He believes that once someone makes an emotional judgment, "a nuclear bomb of truth isn't going to make that person change their opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, attributing this to media manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

Jimmy's past experiences appear to have shaped his current approach to conflict: if "somebody wrongs me I get back at them... I find a way to get back at them and I generally make it funny and spectacular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. He believes in "fight fire with fire" and "gotta top" someone who wrongs him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. This stems from a learned need to "hold your own" and not be a "snowflake" in a tough environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

David Pakman observes that Jimmy's current homophobic and transphobic language makes "a lot of sense" given he was called "gay" as a child for skipping, suggesting he is "weaponizing the way he felt when that was used against him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Broader Psychological Observations
The rigidity of beliefs often seen in politically charged individuals can stem from difficult circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:14">[01:30:14]</a>. When individuals grow up in challenging environments, they may build "pretty big walls" and develop rigid thinking as a survival mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:38">[01:30:38]</a>. The most accessible emotion for individuals with [[effects_of_a_traumatic_upbringing_on_relationships | traumatic upbringings]], especially men, can be anger, which acts as an "umbrella emotion" covering other feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>.

People's political beliefs can be heavily influenced by their upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>. For instance, the disenfranchisement and increasingly difficult lives of some individuals can lead them to support figures who represent a "great big screw you to the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>. This highlights how personal [[impact_of_childhood_and_past_experiences | experiences]] can profoundly shape [[the_impact_of_beliefs_on_perceptions_and_relationships | beliefs and perceptions]] about the world.

While individual experiences are "100 percent real," the conclusions and "abstractions" drawn from them are not always entirely accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>. When engaging with someone who believes their abstractions are 100% real, one is confronting their authentic experience, which makes challenging their beliefs difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:07">[01:36:07]</a>.

## Approaching Rigid Beliefs
When engaging with individuals who hold rigid views, approaching them with an open mind can foster reciprocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>. Pretending to be open-minded while waiting to point out errors will lead to closed-minded responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>. Instead, understanding that people "believe what they believe for a reason, they're not stupid" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>.

Treating people with compassion, even when disagreeing with their beliefs, is emphasized as a more effective strategy than condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:38">[01:40:38]</a>. As Jimmy himself notes, "you really should fight fire with water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>, reflecting a potential shift in his own perspective towards greater understanding and civility, despite his ingrained tendency to "fight fire with fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. This suggests that even deeply held beliefs influenced by a challenging [[impact_of_childhood_and_upbringing_on_mental_health_and_behaviors | upbringing]] can evolve with self-reflection and compassionate engagement.

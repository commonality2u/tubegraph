In today's job market, many job seekers feel that employer requirements are completely out of touch, a feeling supported by the existence of hidden job requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These are unadvertised criteria that companies use for candidate selection, often making the job search feel impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Accidental Revelation
The nature of [[confidential_job_postings | confidential job postings]] and hidden requirements was recently highlighted when a recruiter accidentally emailed a technical candidate their secret internal selection guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These guidelines, provided by the hiring authorities (usually the hiring manager), were never intended for the job candidate or public viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The candidate expressed frustration:
> "The recruiter accidentally emailed me with her secret internal selection guidelines. I didn't understand what was going on at first, but then it dawned on me. The sheer pretentiousness and elitism kind of pissed me off. Not going to lie. I think we probably all felt this way even if we couldn't put a thumb on what it was. I am somebody who meets a lot of these criteria, which is why the recruiter contacted me, but it still pisses me off." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

## Origin of Hidden Requirements
When a job requisition is opened, the hiring manager creates a list of "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While requirements are usually obvious, like total years of experience or a degree, the "prefers" list is where hiring manager bias often comes into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Recruiters then take these requirements and biases to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. A good recruiter should challenge unrealistic expectations from hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Specific Examples of Hidden Requirements (Software Developer Role)
The leaked internal memo for a software development role revealed extreme hidden requirements, which exemplify [[red_flags_in_job_descriptions | red flags in job descriptions]] and [[identifying_absurd_job_postings_and_requirements | absurd job postings and requirements]].

### What They Are Looking For <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   **Education:** University graduate with a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science from a "top program" like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, or University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Special exceptions *might* be made for 4.0 graduates from other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Experience:** Four to ten years of software development experience. Candidates with only two years, even if highly skilled, are not a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Technical Skills:** Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), knowledge of modern technologies like Kotlin, and familiarity with AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This implies a wide breadth of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Career Longevity:** A minimum of two years in each previous role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. "Job hoppers" are not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Being laid off, even with an entire department, makes a candidate unsuitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Company Background:** Significant experience in notable startups backed by firms like Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Candidates who have only worked for large companies (e.g., Google or Facebook) will be rejected because they are perceived as not understanding how to code in a startup environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Diversity & Citizenship:** Diversity hires (e.g., Black, female) are a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Candidates must be a US citizen, US permanent resident, green card holder, or Canadian citizen, with absolutely no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Founder Experience:** Bonus points for being a founding engineer or having founder experience, meaning they have started their own tech firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### What to Avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>
*   **Visa Candidates:** As mentioned above, no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Career Contractors:** Candidates with a background of contract work are not a fit; permanent employment at companies is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Job Hoppers:** Candidates with frequent, short stints in roles are to be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This includes anyone who has ever "hopped jobs at any point in your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Coding Boot Camp Graduates:** Graduates from coding boot camps like Full Stack Academy or Hacked Reactor are automatically disqualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Consulting Background:** Individuals who worked at an IT software development firm instead of a company producing products directly are not considered competent enough to launch products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Limited to Big Companies:** Experience limited solely to large companies like Uber or Intel is not sufficient unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   [[fake_job_postings | Fake Profiles]]: Recruiters are instructed to properly screen candidates due to an increase in [[fake_job_postings | fake scam profiles]], especially with AI and mass application tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Blacklisted Companies:** Candidates who have ever worked at companies such as Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell are "scarlet-lettered" and will "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Impact and Reality
The existence of such [[job_not_matching_description | job not matching description]] scenarios and extreme hidden requirements makes a recruiter's job significantly more difficult, as it drastically limits the candidate pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. While the presented case is extreme, the core issue of companies having hidden, unrealistic wish lists is a common reality in hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. These "hidden requirements" often remain unlisted on public job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Advice for Job Seekers
For job seekers facing such frustrating requirements, it's important to remember that the issue often lies with the company, not the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
It's recommended to:
*   Present a clean, direct resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   Engage in targeted networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   If applicable, showcase skills through a GitHub profile, portfolio, or simple website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   Avoid losing sleep over unrealistic hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Do not apply for jobs from "low-quality employers" with unrealistic wish lists, as this only gives them power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Companies may be forced to adjust their approach if no qualified candidates apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

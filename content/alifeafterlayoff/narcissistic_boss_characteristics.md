A narcissistic boss is one of ten common types of bad bosses that an individual might encounter in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Identifying a Narcissistic Boss
This type of boss is generally easy to identify due to their specific traits and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. They typically possess a very inflated sense of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> and exhibit a larger-than-life ego, always wanting to be the center of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

While a narcissistic boss may appear charming to outsiders and other departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, their true nature becomes apparent behind closed doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Defensiveness** Narcissistic bosses are often very defensive of their own position and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. They may perceive your accomplishments as a threat to their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Belittling others** To make themselves look better, they might tear down employees in front of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of praise** It is unlikely to receive much praise from a narcissistic boss, as they desire all the attention for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

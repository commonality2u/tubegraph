Employment ghosting is a common and frustrating experience for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. It occurs when an employer or company representative moves a candidate into a formalized interviewing process and then fails to follow up on the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Simply applying to a role and not receiving a response is not considered ghosting in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

While employment ghosting is generally considered poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, there are several reasons why it frequently happens.

## Primary Reasons for Employment Ghosting

### Lazy Recruiting or Recruiters
This is often cited as the most common reason for ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Recruiters might be too busy or find it takes too much effort to follow up and close the loop on an interview process they initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Recruiters who are unorganized or lack focus on candidate experience might simply forget or not care to provide updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. In some cases, it's simply a reflection of recruiters not being very good at their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Organizations like Amazon, however, prioritize candidate experience by holding recruiters accountable to strict metrics, including a "two and five promise" for follow-up after interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This forces hiring teams to be decisive and efficient, thereby minimizing ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Amazon views the candidate experience as integral to their employment brand and overall customer perception, understanding that a poor experience could deter potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### [[role_of_internal_work_processes_in_recruitment_ghosting | Bad Internal Work Processes]]
Companies that lack strong internal controls and formalized processes often struggle with ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This is particularly true for companies without a dedicated talent acquisition department within their human resources division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. When best practices in recruiting are not implemented, candidate experience suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Additionally, outdated or inefficient software that cannot handle the volume of applicants can contribute to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
A professional recruiter typically manages 15 to 25 requisitions (jobs) depending on the industry and role complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. When recruiters are burdened with 40 to 50 requisitions—double the manageable workload—candidate experience inevitably suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. With a requirement to submit multiple candidates per job, a recruiter might be managing over 200 candidates at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. While not an excuse, such high volume can lead to candidates falling through the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### Recruiter Forgetting
Sometimes, a recruiter simply forgets to follow up with a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This is more likely when recruiters are overloaded and lack the necessary tools or processes to keep track of all candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. However, this is still considered poor performance and bad form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness or Delays
This is a frequent scenario where ghosting, or the *perception* of ghosting, can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. A hiring manager might sit on a candidate's application for an extended period, or request to see additional candidates before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Such delays can prolong the hiring process by weeks, making it appear to early candidates that they have been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Recruiters often push back in these situations, advocating for a decision if the manager is wishy-washy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Jobs can be placed on hold or re-scoped even after candidates are actively in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. While the company might want to keep current candidates "lukewarm" while looking for a different profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, this is essentially a form of ambiguous non-commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. If a requisition is ultimately closed, recruiters may not always go back to disposition all remaining candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

### Hired Another Candidate Without Closing Others Out
In this case, the recruiter successfully fills the position but fails to follow up with other candidates who were in process to inform them of the hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or bad recruiting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## What to Do If You've Been Ghosted
Unfortunately, there isn't much a job seeker can do if they believe they've been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. However, sending a polite "nudge" email to the recruiter after some time has passed can prompt them to check the application status and provide an update or properly close out the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

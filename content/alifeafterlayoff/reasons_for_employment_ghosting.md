Employment ghosting is a common and frustrating experience for job seekers, occurring when an employer or company representative initiates a formal interviewing process with a candidate but then fails to follow up on the application's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. It is considered a poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>. This is distinct from simply not receiving a response after applying to a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>.

The typical scenario involves applying or being contacted by a recruiter, going through interview preparation and multiple rounds, only to be told, "we'll get back to you shortly," followed by weeks and months of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Common Reasons for Employment Ghosting

### Lazy Recruiting or Recruiters
This is often cited as the most common reason for ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>. Recruiters may be too busy or simply don't put in the effort to close the loop with candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>. They might forget or simply not care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>.

Forward-thinking organizations prioritize candidate experience, understanding its impact on their employment brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">[02:55:01]</a>. For example, Amazon holds its recruiters to strict metrics around candidate experience, with a "two and five promise":
*   **Two days**: To get back to candidates after a hiring manager phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:09">[03:17:09]</a>.
*   **Five days**: To provide feedback after an on-site interview loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.

This system forces efficiency and decisive hiring decisions from teams and recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:07">[03:39:07]</a>. Amazon's philosophy recognizes that many job seekers are also customers, and poor interview experiences can negatively impact their business's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:05">[03:58:05]</a>.

### Bad Work Processes
Companies lacking internal control often struggle with ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:07">[03:39:07]</a>. This is particularly true for companies without a formalized talent acquisition department within HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:01">[04:50:01]</a>. When best practices and formalized processes are not implemented, candidate experience suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:01">[05:09:01]</a>.

Poor technology or applicant tracking systems that cannot handle the volume of applicants can also lead to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:01">[05:17:01]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
A professional recruiter typically manages 15 to 25 requisitions (jobs) at a time, depending on the industry and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. When recruiters are assigned 40-50 requisitions—double a reasonable workload—candidate experience will inevitably suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. With a requirement to send three interviewable candidates per job, a recruiter could be dealing with 200+ candidates at any given time, making it easy for some to fall through the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Recruiter Forgot
While not an excuse for poor candidate experience, recruiters can simply forget to follow up, especially when overloaded and lacking proper tools or processes to track candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness
This is a very common cause of perceived ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:01">[06:54:01]</a>. A hiring manager might delay making a decision on a candidate, asking to see more candidates before deciding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:01">[07:11:01]</a>. This can delay the hiring process by weeks, making it seem as though early candidates have been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:01">[07:29:01]</a>. Recruiters often push back on indecisive managers to ensure a timely disposition for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:01">[07:47:01]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Jobs can be placed on hold or re-scoped in the middle of the recruitment process, even with candidates already in process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Hiring managers may request that candidates be kept "lukewarm," meaning they are liked but not enough to make an immediate decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. This practice, often described as [[gaslighting in recruitment]], involves keeping candidates on standby while looking for alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Recruiters often push back on this to maintain good candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. If a requisition is simply closed, recruiters may not always disposition all remaining candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

### Hired Another Candidate
Sometimes, another candidate is hired, and the recruiter simply closes the requisition without following up with the other candidates who were in process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or bad recruiting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## How Candidates Can Respond
If you suspect you've been ghosted, there isn't much you can do beyond sending the recruiter a polite "nudge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. A simple follow-up email can prompt a recruiter to check the status and provide an update or properly close out your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

This article discusses Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) and their implications, drawing insights from an expert with 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting for major corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### What is a Performance Improvement Process (PIP)?

A Performance Improvement Process (PIP), also known as a Performance Improvement Plan, is typically one of the final steps an HR department takes as a last resort for performance-related issues before termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

> A PIP is a defined period of time with measurable goals that must be met for an employee to keep their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The goals set within a PIP are usually very specific and measurable, allowing for clear determination of whether they have been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

#### Implications of a PIP

*   **Failure to Meet Goals**: If an employee goes through a PIP and does not meet the defined metrics, the end result is typically termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Success in Meeting Goals**: If an employee takes the PIP seriously and improves their performance, they can successfully come off the PIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. After coming off a PIP, it is up to the employee to continue elevating their performance to meet the standards of the rest of their team and distance themselves from the previous period of poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

[!WARNING] A PIP is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> and should be taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Lead-Up to a PIP: Documentation and Performance Decline

Before a PIP is issued, several signs may indicate an employee is on "shaky ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> or that their job is "on the rocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

*   **Declining Metrics**: If an employee's [[company_performance_metrics_and_their_impact_on_employment | performance metrics]] are significantly lower than their co-workers', especially compared to sales quotas or other measurable targets, their name is likely on a list, signaling underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Manager Displeasure**: A sudden shift where a manager becomes displeased with an employee's work indicates that the employee is not hitting the mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Work Redistribution**: If clients or projects an employee used to support are being pulled away and redistributed, it means faith in their ability to perform has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Exclusion from Key Discussions**: No longer being invited to key meetings or discussions where one was previously involved suggests a manager is doing damage control or distancing the employee from projects and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Cross-Functional Issues**: "Weirdness" or evasiveness from leaders of cross-functional groups that an employee supports can also be a sign of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

#### The Role of Performance Appraisals

A significant red flag indicating preparation for termination is when [[understanding_performance_appraisals | performance appraisals]] suddenly and drastically slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If an employee with a history of decent appraisals receives a surprisingly low and critical appraisal, it means the manager is likely starting to document their dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

HR professionals, when approached by a manager wanting to terminate an employee, will first pull the employee's file and review past [[understanding_performance_appraisals | performance appraisals]] for documented performance decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This is done to limit liability by ensuring there is a "paper trail" documenting performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. HR will often instruct managers to begin documented coaching sessions with the employee, with these sessions reflected in [[understanding_performance_appraisals | performance appraisals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This process of documenting performance serves to defend an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Taking Action

If an employee notices any of these signs, including being put on a PIP, it is crucial to start thinking about "what's next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Whether attempting to address the performance issues or considering a career change, both require concerted effort and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Resources like "Life After Layoff" specialize in helping individuals navigate the hiring process, land dream jobs, and manage adverse employment situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. They offer information on [[career_management_and_planning | career management]] and how to navigate the hiring process effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

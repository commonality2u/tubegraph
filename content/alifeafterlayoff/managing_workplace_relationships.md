Careful communication is crucial in the [[challenges_of_workplace_relationships_and_professional_boundaries | workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Being extremely mindful of what is said to [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] can prevent significant trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This extends beyond the idea that [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] are not necessarily friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, emphasizing the need for extreme caution in what you disclose to [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] and others in the [[challenges_of_workplace_relationships_and_professional_boundaries | workplace setting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

As a former HR professional, a list of common disclosures that lead to issues has been compiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## What Not to Disclose or Do at Work

### 1. Your Active Job Search
Disclosing that you are in an active job search should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. News of a job search spreads quickly through a department via whispers and gossip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This information will likely reach your boss, senior leaders, and the HR department, potentially leading to a premature exit from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Furthermore, be cautious about where you place your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Uploading a resume showing your current company/job to public databases like Indeed or LinkedIn, and setting yourself as "available to work," can also alert your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### 2. Negative Opinions About Your Boss or Gossip About Co-workers
It is advisable to refrain from saying anything negative about your boss, even if you feel that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even with a [[building_relationships_at_work | work ally]] or close confidant who also complains about the boss, engaging in such conversations can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Similarly, avoid gossiping about other [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Developing a reputation as a gossip can lead to [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] filing complaints or reporting you to management, drawing unwanted attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The boss often finds out regardless of how careful you are or how close your confidant is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 3. Your Salary
While salary transparency is generally positive for a [[importance_of_good_employment_relationships | level playing field]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, it is not recommended to discuss your salary within your own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Sharing salary information can lead to:
*   Someone realizing they are underpaid and becoming upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Employees demanding higher compensation from their boss, potentially leading to a loss of trust from management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Even if there are legitimate reasons for pay differences (e.g., skill, experience, market changes), a boss who loses trust will likely not consider you for [[managing_workplace_dynamics_and_promotions | promotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Instead, share salary information anonymously on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This allows others to know fair compensation for roles without personal blowback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### 4. Borrowing Money from Co-workers
Avoid borrowing money from [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Just like with family or friends, mixing money or business with [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] can make relationships "sticky" and often ends poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Asking for money can create an uncomfortable situation for the other person, potentially leading them to report it to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### 5. Complimenting Physical Attributes
Do not compliment [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] on their physical attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The interpretation of a compliment is subjective, and even if your intent is innocent, it's how the compliment is *perceived* by the recipient that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. HR departments frequently receive complaints about [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] making others feel uncomfortable with such comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While general professional compliments (e.g., "that hairdo looks great on you") may be acceptable, ensure they remain professional and not "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### 6. Assuming Someone is Pregnant
Never call out or assume that someone is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The outcomes are either:
*   They are pregnant but not ready to disclose it, forcing them to expedite their announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   They are not pregnant, which can be offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
Let the individual take the lead in disclosing such personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### 7. Discussing Lawsuits or Employee Relations Issues
If you are involved in a major [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employee relations issue]] or plan to sue the company, do not discuss it with [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Spilling details about your case, alleged illegal activities, or legal strategy can provide the company with information to defend themselves, or prompt them to take proactive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Keep such matters confidential and discuss them only with an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### 8. Telling Off-Color Jokes
Avoid telling off-color jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Even if a joke is intended innocently, it can be interpreted as offensive by the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The perception of the joke, not the intention, is what matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Stick to "dumb dad jokes" or avoid jokes altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### 9. Discussing Politics
In the [[challenges_of_workplace_relationships_and_professional_boundaries | modern workplace]], it is increasingly difficult but important to avoid discussing politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Political discussions are often "hot buttons" and can easily offend someone, regardless of your stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. These conversations frequently lead to arguments and are unlikely to change anyone's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Be mindful of the company's leanings as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

To protect your career and avoid legal issues, it is best to take the high road and treat [[building_relationships_at_work | co-workers]] with a high degree of [[handling_workplace_professionalism | professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. While being friendly is acceptable, exercise caution in what you say and disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

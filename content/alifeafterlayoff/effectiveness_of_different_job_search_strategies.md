As a corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience interviewing and hiring thousands of people, Brian from All Life After Layoff ranks 15 different job search strategies based on their effectiveness and return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The ranking assumes that job seekers are looking to find employment as quickly as possible with the least amount of time spent for the biggest return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Strategies are scored from 1 (least effective) to 10 (most effective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Least Effective Strategies (Score 1-3)

### Cold Calling (Score: 1/10)
Cold calling involves soliciting a job without prior knowledge of an open position, such as calling human resources, physically dropping into an office unannounced, or sending unsolicited messages on platforms like LinkedIn stating "I'm looking for a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: This method "almost never works" for corporate recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Not a good use of time for an [[strategies_for_finding_a_new_job | active job search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Social Media Engagement (Score: 1/10)
Engaging with a company's social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) in hopes of being noticed by a hiring team is generally ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Reasoning**: HR and talent acquisition departments typically do not manage social media; marketing teams usually handle this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Recruiters rarely consider candidates based on social media engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Avoid wasting time on this for your [[strategies_for_improving_job_search_success | job search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Job Fairs (Score: 2/10)
Job fairs involve attending events, often organized by unemployment centers or universities, where employers set up booths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: Can be effective, especially for blue-collar roles or entry-level university positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, recruiters often find it challenging to identify highly qualified candidates, walking away with only one or two promising resumes per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For job seekers, it can feel like "window shopping" and is not a highly targeted approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Not ideal for those seeking quick employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Industry Events / In-Person Networking (Score: 3/10)
These events involve attending mixers or associations to mingle with professionals in your industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: Considered a very untargeted way to find a job because the chances of meeting someone with an immediate relevant opening are slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While it can build long-term contacts, it's not efficient for a quick job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Consideration**: Can be challenging for introverts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Online Forums (Score: 3/10)
Online forums, including tech forums or LinkedIn groups, allow for networking within specific industries or job types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: Generally not a targeted recruiting method as specific job applications are rare, and opportunities quickly attract many candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Recruiter's Perspective**: Recruiters may use these forums to find candidates with demonstrated expertise in niche areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Building a knowledge repository is not bad, but it's not the best use of time for [[job_search_strategies_for_quick_employment | quick employment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Moderately Effective Strategies (Score 4-6)

### Professional Associations (Score: 4/10)
Joining professional associations, such as the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), can help job seekers connect with others hyper-focused on a specific genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: Can be a decent way to brand oneself, especially in a local labor market and for white-collar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Becoming known as an expert by getting involved in committees can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Company Website Applications (Score: 5/10)
Directly applying for jobs on a company's website, bypassing external job boards, ensures your resume gets seen by the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Advantage**: Applications directly filter into the company's Applicant Tracking System (ATS), unlike some external job boards where resumes might not automatically transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: If you see a job posted on an external job board, it's often worth applying directly on the company's website for a slightly higher chance of visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Headhunter/Agency Recruiters (Score: 5/10)
Working with a third-party recruiter who is contracted by employers to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: While headhunters might have multiple roles, their interest in a candidate often fizzles quickly if the primary role they considered you for doesn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: There's no reason not to use an agency (it shouldn't cost the job seeker anything), but don't rely solely on them. Job seekers should still take ownership of their [[job_search_strategies_and_career_management | career management]] and conduct most of their own [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Personal Website/Blog (Score: 5/10)
Setting up a website or blog to brand oneself as an expert, often with a portfolio of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: Essential for creative fields (design, photography) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Writing content about niche work can brand you as an expert, leading companies to seek you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Consideration**: Requires effort to set up and maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Results are not immediate; it's a longer-term [[strategies_for_improving_job_search_success | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Job Boards (Score: 6/10)
The most common way to look for jobs, involving applying to active postings on platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Challenges**: High competition (thousands of applicants for some jobs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Employers also use other methods to source candidates, making the pool even larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Only 5-10% of jobs are filled through active postings due to candidate misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Despite the effort and competition, it only takes one offer to secure employment, making it a necessary part of an [[job_search_strategies_and_career_management | active job search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Most Effective Strategies (Score 7-10)

### Online Networking (Score: 7/10)
Targeted online networking, typically via LinkedIn, is less intimidating than in-person events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: A powerful way to look for a job if done correctly, avoiding unsolicited blasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Learn proper etiquette for [[utilizing_efficiency_tools_in_job_search | effective online networking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Responding to Advertisements (Score: 7/10)
Responding to physical "help wanted" signs on billboards, trucks, or company doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: Offers a good return on effort if you are a decent fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Companies actively advertising like this are often struggling to find candidates, increasing your chances of being seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: More effective for blue-collar roles than white-collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Internships/Co-ops (Score: 7/10)
Especially powerful for entry-level job seekers with little to no relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: Provides a significant leg up on the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Offers a "foot in the door" with an organization, potentially allowing you to build relationships with hiring managers and gain goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Absolutely target internships and co-ops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Industry Contacts (Score: 8/10)
Leveraging past working relationships with colleagues or former bosses who have moved to other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: A very powerful way to gain entry, as a former manager can "pull you along" to their new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This often bypasses deep interview processes (requiring only a courtesy interview) and typically results in a fair or better rate of pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Stay close with influential people in your professional network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

### Employee Referrals (Score: 8/10)
Seeking referrals from someone actively working at a company where you're interested in a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: The referrer often receives a bonus, and the referred candidate gets direct entry into the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Employee referrals almost always receive preference over external candidates, second only to internal applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: It is definitely worth grooming these networks to get a leg up on the competition and skip to the front of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Outbound Sourcing (Score: 10/10)
This is how most recruiters (80% or more) fill their jobs, by actively searching the market for candidates who closely fit desired profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Job Seeker's Role**: While you can't control what a recruiter is looking for, you can make yourself "discoverable" for the jobs you desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: If a recruiter finds you, you're pulled directly to the front of the line, bypassing the extensive application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Understanding how recruiters source and making yourself discoverable (e.g., via LinkedIn) is the single best thing you can do for your [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_navigate_the_job_market | active job search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

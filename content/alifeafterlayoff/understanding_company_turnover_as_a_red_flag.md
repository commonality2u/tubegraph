When receiving a job offer, it's crucial to pay close attention to potential [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flags]] that suggest a company might not be the dream employer it appears to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. One significant indicator of potential issues is the company's [[high_and_excessive_turnover_rates_as_indicators_of_toxicity | turnover rate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Turnover as an Indicator
High turnover in a department or across the broader company is a significant [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flag]] that warrants close attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. If a department struggles to retain employees, experiencing a "revolving door" of staff, it's essential to question the underlying reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This could be due to:
*   **Management Issues** The hiring manager themselves might be the cause of employees leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Organizational Culture** A toxic or problematic corporate culture can lead to high [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | voluntary turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

If these issues are present, candidates may find themselves updating their resume again in a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Specific Turnover Scenarios
### Your Prospective Boss is Leaving
It is a major [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flag]] if your direct boss, the person you would be reporting to, is in the process of leaving the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Accepting a job excited about a particular management style, only to arrive on day one with a different boss, could significantly change your decision to accept the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### "Confidential" Job Postings
A job posted as "confidential" means the organization is seeking to replace an employee who is unaware they are being replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. While there can be valid business reasons for this (e.g., an employee has been given every chance to succeed but has not) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, it is a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This situation can indicate a lack of transparency or concern for employee well-being, potentially impacting your own [[turnover_rates_and_job_stability | job stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## How to Assess Turnover Risk
Candidates should be proactive in their assessment of a company's [[dealing_with_high_turnover_and_job_insecurity | turnover risk]]:
*   **Inquire About Position Openings** Always ask the hiring manager why the position is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If the previous person was terminated for cause, understanding the reasons can offer insights into the manager's expectations or what might be required for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Observe and Interact with Peers** During the [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | interview process]], pay attention to any negative dialogue or strange comments from potential co-workers or peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Jokes about the "gauntlet" or derogatory comments about the boss can be telling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Request to meet with co-workers one-on-one and ask questions like:
    *   "What do you like about working here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
    *   "How is this boss to work with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
    *   "How would you describe the corporate culture?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
*   **Research Company Health** Investigate if the company is growing or if there are rumors of acquisition by a venture capitalist, or reliance on funding to "keep the lights on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A quick Google search can reveal swirling rumors that might put you back on the job market within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

It is critical to assess the company as rigorously as they assess you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This due diligence helps avoid a "job-hopping resume" and ensures you choose a stable and supportive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

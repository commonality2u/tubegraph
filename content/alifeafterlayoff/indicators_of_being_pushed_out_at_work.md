Have you ever felt an uneasy feeling at work, as if your days might be numbered? This feeling could be a sign your company is attempting to "quietly fire" you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, also referred to as being [[signs_youre_about_to_get_fired | pushed out by a company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Constructive Dismissal

In Human Resources (HR), the concept of **constructive dismissal** describes a situation where a company makes your employment situation so unbearable that you have no choice but to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Companies might resort to this strategy for various reasons:
*   They may perceive you as a potential problem and want to avoid additional issues that could arise from direct termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
*   They might seek to avoid paying out certain benefits, such as unemployment insurance, which they would not be responsible for if you leave voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

## Key Indicators You May Be Being Pushed Out

While one or two of these [[signs_of_being_undervalued_by_your_employer | signs]] don't automatically mean you're being quiet fired, noticing several should prompt you to pay attention and trust your gut feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:03">[06:36:03]</a>.

### No Raises in Several Years
This is a significant red flag, especially if you know that other colleagues in your department or company have received raises while you have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. If your company has cut you off from future raises, it's a strong indicator that it's time to update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### Repeatedly Passed Up for Promotion
If you have expressed interest in a promotion and have diligently worked to position yourself as the ideal candidate, yet are consistently overlooked, or if less deserving individuals are promoted instead, it's a concerning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Companies typically have internal discussions about the potential consequences of promoting someone else over you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Being continually blocked from career advancement suggests it's time to act like a free agent and explore other job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Denied PTO or Vacation Requests
If your requests for paid time off or vacation are repeatedly denied, assuming you're not abusing the system, your timing makes sense, and you've coordinated coverage with colleagues, it indicates that your employer likely does not value you and intends to make your work life uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

### Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
Being placed on a PIP or any other formal performance management tool often signifies that the company is preparing to manage you out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. While not every PIP guarantees termination, if the plan's requirements seem unreasonable or unrealistic, it strongly suggests the company is trying to encourage your voluntary departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Schedule Manipulation
If your schedule is suddenly altered, either through mandatory overtime during periods when your boss knows you are unavailable, or by drastically cutting your hours to the bare minimum (potentially affecting benefits), this could be a tactic to encourage you to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. For hourly or shift-paid employees, this can significantly impact their paycheck, serving as a motivator to seek new employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Unbearable Workload
A sudden and significant increase in your workload, making it unbearable—such as being forced to do double the work without additional pay—can be an intentional strategy by unscrupulous companies to prompt you to seek another job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

### Lackluster Performance Appraisals
If your performance appraisals suddenly become critical, especially after a history of positive reviews, and your boss is overly critical of things they previously complimented, this is a warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. HR departments use performance appraisals for formal documentation, and a sudden shift in appraisal quality indicates active engagement between your boss and HR to manage you as a "performance issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Such criticism can be highly demotivating and may [[signs_to_quit_your_job | force you out the door]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

### Boss Disengagement
A major warning sign is if your boss stops communicating with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Skipping or repeatedly rescheduling private one-on-one meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   Not responding to emails in a timely manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   Being consistently unavailable or having a closed-door policy for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   Failing to provide necessary information or help clear roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

### Exclusion from Work Activities
If you are suddenly removed from projects you were leading, no longer invited to staff meetings you used to attend, or excluded from informal "water cooler talk," it's a strong indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Being publicly shunned by your boss when they are with other people also suggests a deliberate attempt to distance you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

## Your Options if Being Pushed Out

If you find yourself in a situation where you believe the company is constructively discharging you, you have several options:

1.  **Force the Company's Hand:** You can continue the status quo and make the company formally terminate your employment if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Seek New Employment:** As a "free agent," you can choose to quit your job and find a more supportive employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. Remaining in a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic environment]] is detrimental to your personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
3.  **Consult an Attorney:** If you suspect you are being discriminated against, it is advisable to seek advice from a local attorney who can interpret relevant laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

It is always good practice to keep your resume updated and ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

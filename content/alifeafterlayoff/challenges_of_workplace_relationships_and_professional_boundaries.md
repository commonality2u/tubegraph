Understanding the nature of [[managing_workplace_relationships | workplace relationships]] is crucial for career success and personal well-being. A key truth to acknowledge is that your boss and co-workers are not your friends in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This perspective helps in [[handling_workplace_professionalism | handling workplace professionalism]] and navigating the [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employer-employee relationship dynamics]].

## Self-Interest in the Workplace

Everyone in the workplace operates with a degree of self-interest, which is not inherently negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Employees should also be "selfish" in their careers by actively looking to better themselves, as no one else will do it for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If you are not proactively advancing your career, it's highly likely your co-workers and boss are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Pitfalls of Close Workplace Relationships

Maintaining overly close relationships at work can lead to painful consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For instance, if a co-worker you've shared personal details with suddenly becomes your boss, the dynamic of your relationship will inevitably change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Similarly, competition for the same [[managing_workplace_dynamics_and_promotions | promotional opportunity]] can significantly alter a relationship, especially if one person is chosen over the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The transient nature of these relationships is also highlighted when employees are laid off. Often, individuals find that former close work contacts do not maintain communication after several months, underscoring the professional rather than personal foundation of these bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of setting [[handling_workplace_professionalism | professional boundaries]] even when [[building_relationships_at_work | building relationships at work]].

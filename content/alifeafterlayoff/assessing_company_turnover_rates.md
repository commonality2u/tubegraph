When considering a new job offer, it is crucial to assess a company's [[employee_turnover_and_company_stability | turnover rates]] and stability, as these can indicate potential issues within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Even after successfully navigating the hiring process, lingering concerns may arise from observations made during interviews or facility visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Red Flags Related to Turnover

Several indicators can signal potential [[signs_of_high_turnover_and_its_implications | signs of high turnover]] or instability:

### Disengaged or Problematic Direct Manager
A significant red flag is if the person you would directly report to appears disengaged or "off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. This could manifest as:
*   Lack of full engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>
*   Distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>
*   Showing up late to the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>
*   Complaining about their current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>
*   Complaining about the previous incumbent in the role or other co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>

Such behaviors can indicate brewing trouble if you accept the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. Ideally, you want to feel a similar level of excitement and engagement from your future boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.

### High Departmental or Company Turnover
If there's a high [[high_turnover_rates | turnover]] rate within the department or the broader company, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. Even worse, if your prospective boss is in the process of leaving, it can drastically alter your initial expectations and excitement about the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. A "revolving door" scenario in a department warrants a critical examination of *why* people are leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

### Reason for Position Opening
Understanding why the position is open is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:41">[03:03:41]</a>. Ask the hiring manager directly about the previous employee's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:48">[03:03:48]</a>.
*   **Termination for Cause:** If the previous employee was terminated for cause, inquire about the specific reasons to understand if the hiring manager has unreasonable expectations or if there are specific behaviors to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:55">[03:03:55]</a>.
*   **Confidential Posting:** Be wary of job postings listed as "confidential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:18">[03:04:18]</a>. This often means the organization is replacing someone who is unaware of their impending termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:25">[03:04:25]</a>. While there might be valid business reasons (e.g., the employee had every opportunity to succeed but failed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:44">[03:04:44]</a>, it can signal a lack of transparency and raise concerns about your own [[evaluating_job_security_and_company_loyalty | job stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:32">[03:04:32]</a>. Ideally, employees should have an opportunity to correct performance issues before termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:38">[03:04:38]</a>.

### Negative Peer Dialogue
Pay attention to informal comments from potential co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:10">[03:03:10]</a>. Negative dialogue or strange comments, such as "poking fun at you walking into a gauntlet" or derogatory remarks about the boss ("you must be a brave soul"), are strong indicators of underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:10">[03:03:10]</a>. This "water cooler talk" can reveal a lot about the work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:23">[03:03:23]</a>.

## How to Assess Turnover Risk

To mitigate the risk of joining a company with high [[voluntary_turnover_and_its_impact_on_organizations | voluntary turnover]], incorporate these actions into your interview process:
*   **Ask Direct Questions:** Inquire specifically about the reasons for high departmental [[high_turnover_rates | turnover rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:28">[02:02:28]</a>. Pay close attention to the hiring manager's response; if they are the root cause, you might find yourself job searching again soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:39">[02:02:39]</a>.
*   **Assess Organizational Culture:** Use the interview process to assess the overall [[assessing_company_culture_during_interviews | organizational culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>. This is critical if the culture is a factor in [[employee_turnover_and_company_stability | company turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>.
*   **Meet with Peers:** Request one-on-one meetings with potential co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:27">[03:03:27]</a>. Ask specific questions like:
    *   "What do you like about working here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:30">[03:03:30]</a>
    *   "How is this boss to work with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:32">[03:03:32]</a>
    *   "How would you describe the corporate culture?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:34">[03:03:34]</a>
    These questions can help you [[assessing_leadership_and_company_culture_in_interviews | assess leadership and company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:36">[03:03:36]</a>.
*   **Research Company Health:** Investigate the company's growth and financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:04">[05:05:04]</a>. Rumors of acquisition by venture capitalists or reliance on external funding to stay afloat can be red flags indicating potential instability and future layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:06">[05:05:06]</a>. A quick Google search for recent news or rumors is advisable before accepting an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:39">[05:05:39]</a>. These aspects relate to [[company_performance_metrics_and_their_impact_on_employment | company performance metrics]] and their impact on employment.

Ultimately, you are a "free agent" in the job market and should assess potential employers as rigorously as they assess you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:06">[08:08:06]</a>. Identifying and understanding these red flags related to turnover can help you avoid a "job-hopping resume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:32">[05:05:32]</a> and make an informed decision for your career.

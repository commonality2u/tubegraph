Intel has announced its largest round of [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] to date, signaling potential shifts in the tech industry. This follows a trend of increasing instability in the sector, raising questions about career longevity and market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Intel's Massive Workforce Reductions

Intel is reportedly cutting 20% of its entire workforce under new CEO Li Bhutan, impacting approximately 21,000 roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This is Intel's biggest round of [[Performance and layoffs | layoffs]] yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. In the previous year, Intel laid off 15% of its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, indicating a consistent and exponential shrinking of their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Reasons for Layoffs

The substantial [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] are largely attributed to Intel's financial struggles and a strategic turnaround effort by CEO Li Bhutan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
Financial losses include:
*   A $1.6 billion loss in Q2 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   A staggering $16.6 billion loss in Q3 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

These losses necessitated "right-sizing" the organization to reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Targeting Middle Management

A significant portion of the [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] are aimed at middle management, with the goal of "removing bureaucracy" and flattening the organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Companies view middle managers as an unnecessary layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Impact on Career Paths
> The elimination of middle management layers poses a challenge for individual contributors seeking promotions, as it removes a traditional career progression step from contributor to director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This trend could lead to a future shortage of director-level and above candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Role of New Leadership

Li Bhutan, who previously served on Intel's board of directors, advocated for reducing corporate bloat and flattening the organization to enable quicker decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. He left the board after disagreements before the previous 15,000-person [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoff]] announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Following the termination of the previous CEO, Li Bhutan was brought back to lead Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

His stated strategy is to make Intel an "engineering-focused company" with a priority on retaining and recruiting top engineering talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, mass [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] make this goal difficult to achieve, as talented employees may seek more stable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

> [!INFO] Warning Sign for Employees
> The arrival of a new CEO or senior leader often precedes [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | massive layoffs]] and major corporate restructuring due to new visions, implementations, and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Organizations are often "fractured" and never the same afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Broader Tech Market Trends

While Intel's [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] significantly spiked total tech layoffs in April (23,000 total, mostly Intel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, the overall trend of tech layoffs has been decreasing since the end of 2023, showing some stabilization into 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### The "Gravy Train" is Over
The period from Q3 2020 through Q1 2022 was considered the "very best time to be in tech," with companies engaging in bidding wars for employees and high job seeker demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. However, this ended abruptly with significant overhiring, leading to widespread [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] in the second half of 2022 and throughout 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The tech market is now much more competitive, and "the gravy train is over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Companies are adopting a much shorter outlook, hiring for immediate needs and then laying off employees once their services are no longer required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The concept of long-term employment or companies investing in employees is becoming increasingly rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### The Impact of AI
[[AIdriven_layoffs_in_various_industries | Disruptive technologies]], particularly [[AIdriven_layoffs_in_various_industries | AI]], are becoming a serious consideration for job security in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Junior and even mid-level development roles are potentially more at risk due to AI tools that can automate tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Stay Proactive
> Employees are advised to assess their skills carefully against market demands and stay informed about evolving industry trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Proactively looking at job postings, even without applying, can help identify necessary skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Waiting until a [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoff]] occurs to discover one's replaceability will result in playing catch-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Challenges

Several individuals have shared stories highlighting the challenging tech job market:

*   **Becca Ewex:** A tech professional who has experienced multiple [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] in a short period, including one instance just seven months after starting a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This makes it difficult to gain career traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Bro Niho:** Left a stable job at a large software company for a smaller e-commerce company, only to be included in a 20% reduction in force exactly 30 days after joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. He describes the current tech job market as one of the worst he's experienced, characterized by ghosting, ghost jobs, and extremely long interview processes, even with referrals and networking efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. He questions his ability to remain in tech despite his qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

These stories illustrate the severe [[impact_of_layoffs_and_poor_company_practices | impact of layoffs]] and a lack of corporate loyalty, with companies showing little regard for the disruption caused to individuals' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The market is competitive, with experienced individuals taking lower-paying roles, increasing competition for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

## Advice for Navigating the Tech Job Market

Despite the challenges, people are still getting hired in tech, even those in their 50s and 60s into decent, high-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Consistency and a positive attitude are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

Key strategies for job seekers include:
*   **Leverage Networks:** Maximize professional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Optimize Resumes:** Create concise, clean, and targeted resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Targeted Networking:** Crucial for job searching and career development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Vet Companies Thoroughly:** Research a company's past [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoff]] history, restructuring, funding, and new leadership before accepting an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Stay Current with Skills:** Ensure skills align with market demands and disruptive technologies like [[AIdriven_layoffs_in_various_industries | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Proactive Career Management:** Take proactive steps to reclaim control in your career, even if currently employed and comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

The overall outlook for the tech space is still being assessed, but remaining proactive and adapting to [[changes_in_corporate_loyalty_and_employment_practices | changing employment practices]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

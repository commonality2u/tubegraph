As a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, insights into the hiring process can provide job seekers with an advantage in landing their desired role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This information is specifically geared towards interviews with internal corporate recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Types of Recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

It's important to distinguish between two main types of recruiters:

### Headhunters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   **Definition**: A third-party contracted by a company to fill a position on contingency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: They are paid upon placement, typically 15-25% of the hired candidate's first-year income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Role Knowledge**: Headhunters generally do not possess the same level of detailed knowledge about the role as an internal corporate recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Corporate Recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   **Definition**: Full-time employees of the company, part of a talent acquisition department, often under HR or as a standalone department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: They receive a salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Their job is to find the best possible talent for their hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Their metric for success is finding the best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Role Knowledge**: Corporate recruiters often support specific functional groups and work repeatedly with the same hiring managers, leading to strong relationships and clear understanding of position requirements and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **First Interview**: The initial interview with a corporate recruiter is usually a screening to assess baseline competencies for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Understanding what a recruiter says versus what they actually mean can provide an [[strategies for effective job search and interviews | insider's advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Preparation and Interest
*   **Recruiter Says**: "What do you know about the company?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **They Mean**: Coming unprepared without understanding the company or position is a negative mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Preparedness indicates your level of interest and engagement in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

*   **They Mean**: These are baseline requirements for the position that the hiring manager needs to see on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Communication Clarity
*   **Recruiter Says**: Rephrases a question repeatedly or brings you back to the same question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Each question assesses a specific competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It's acceptable to ask for clarification, e.g., "Can you please give me an idea of what it is that you're looking for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*   **Recruiter Says**: "The salary range... is between this and this, so it's a little bit lower than what you're expecting. Would you be open to that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
*   **They Mean**: They are trying to gauge your flexibility. Answer honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Recruiter Says**: "This position is scoped a little lower than you're expecting, and if you don't mind, I'll give you a call when I have a more enriched role." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **They Mean**: They cannot afford you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It's advisable to stand firm on your realistic requirements, backed by good data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **They Mean**: The decision to move you forward has already been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **Recruiter Says**: Tries to "sell" you the job and get you excited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

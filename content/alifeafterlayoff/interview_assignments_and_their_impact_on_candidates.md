Job interviews are a common method for hiring, though some argue their effectiveness, suggesting that "doers perform better than actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. An alternative approach proposed is to give candidates assignments, which proponents believe provide better evidence for hiring by revealing if candidates "give a damn about the assignment," bring "their own ideas," "dare to contact people within your company," and "meet the ask" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This method aims to evaluate actual work performance rather than just a "stellar performance in an interview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> or "fudge a few references" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## Criticisms of Interview Assignments

Despite the perceived benefits, interview assignments are often criticized for being "uncandidate focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Significant Time Commitment
Assignments can demand a substantial time investment from job seekers. While some might take "eight to 12 hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, potentially requiring an "entire weekend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, some companies reportedly assign projects that take "one to three weeks" to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This expectation places a heavy burden on candidates.

### Low Return on Investment for Candidates
Given that only one person will ultimately be hired, the chance of receiving an offer after dedicating significant time to an assignment is often very low, potentially "at best 10%" if there are ten final candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. For companies with multi-stage screening processes involving extensive test projects, the success rate can be as low as 3.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### Exploitation of Intellectual Property
Some critics argue that companies may use these assignments to "take your intellectual property and your project" and "use it to solve one of their real life business problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a> without compensating the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### Unrealistic Expectations on Candidate Engagement
An expectation for candidates to "contact people within your company to get their view" for an assignment is considered unrealistic. Current employees are often too busy with their own jobs to dedicate time to random interviewees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Red Flags in the Hiring Process

Certain aspects of the [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | hiring process]] can serve as [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | red flags]] for job seekers:

*   **Excessive Screening Stages:** A company bragging about a screening process that can take "between two and five weeks to complete" with numerous steps, including multi-week test projects, suggests a potentially problematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Compensation for Extensive Work:** If a company asks for a "one to three week presentation or project" without offering compensation, it is advised to "walk away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## Advice for Job Seekers Regarding Assignments

When faced with an interview assignment, job seekers should:
*   Carefully consider their interest in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   Evaluate the "cost benefit ratio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, as the exchange is often not good, and the success rate is "really bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   Be cautious of companies that may believe these assignments are a good idea "on paper" but demonstrate a lack of focus on the [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Identifying these [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | subtle red flags]] during the job search is crucial to "spot low quality employers and low quality garbage opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Avoiding such positions can prevent weakening one's resume and make it easier to find better quality opportunities in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

As a recruiter and career coach, the approach to resume writing emphasizes putting your best foot forward to secure more job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While there isn't one singular "right" way to write a resume, the ultimate test is whether it yields desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The advice offered stems from a [[recruiter_perspective_on_resume_writing | corporate recruiter perspective]], focusing on how resumes are quickly screened by recruiters (often in a 5-second glance) and hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The goal is to capture attention quickly and ensure the resume leads to a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Profiling vs. Summarizing

Instead of viewing a resume as a summary of all past accomplishments, it's more effective to think of it as a profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This means:

*   **Targeted Content**: Rather than hoping an employer finds something they like in a broad summary, the resume should be *profiled* for a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Employer Focus**: [[tips_for_improving_resume_content | Focus on what the hiring teams actually care about]], moving away from accomplishments that may not be relevant to the specific job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Concise Fit**: The objective is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job being applied to, with the end goal of securing an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## The Crucial Role of Customization

Customization is a vitally important step, especially in today's job market and for highly sought-after remote roles where competition is fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

*   **Stand Out**: Customizing your resume helps you stand out in a competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Adapt to Market Changes**: The job market has changed significantly since 2018, requiring a more tailored approach than simply submitting a generic resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Many applicants are "lazy" about customizing their resumes, presenting an opportunity to gain a competitive edge and receive a phone call for an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Practical Advice for Customization

*   **Relate to the Job**: Ensure that actionable terms and concepts on your resume directly relate to the specific job you are applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Realism in Fit**: Be realistic about your fit for the jobs you apply to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Thoroughly [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles | review the job posting]] to confirm if you truly meet the requirements, especially when facing hundreds or thousands of other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Clear Conveyance of Fit**: Your resume must clearly convey your suitability for the role to maximize your chances of entering the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## [[Common mistakes in resume writing | Common Resume Mistakes to Avoid]]

Beyond customization, certain [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid | common mistakes]] can hinder a resume's effectiveness:

*   **Outdated Templates**: Avoid using outdated templates from graphic designers, especially those with excessive graphics, charts, or "cute" presentations, as they can distract from the core information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Simple, one-column templates with clean, easy-to-read fonts and basic colors (blue, black, dark green) are generally recommended for most fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The exception is for creative roles like graphic design, where a more creative approach might be expected, but even then, using a template designed by another graphic designer might not be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **ATS Compliance**: Templates designed without understanding Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) can be ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   **Contact Information**: Ensure contact information is vertical, not horizontal, as ATS systems often struggle to parse horizontal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. If you frequently need to manually enter your name, phone, or address after uploading your resume, it likely isn't ATS-compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Wordiness**: Avoid long blocks of text that are difficult to scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Be concise and selective with your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Language**: Remove company-specific or proprietary language (e.g., internal project names, division names, product types) that external recruiters and hiring managers won't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Use clear, common industry language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Generic Fluffy Terminology**: Eliminate overused phrases like "team player" or "great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Important competencies will be assessed during interviews, and such terms don't effectively demonstrate them on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Stubbornness**: If your resume isn't yielding results, make changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Getting repeatedly rejected at the application level suggests the resume isn't working, especially if you believe you are a strong fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Remember to "plan, do, check, and adjust." If your resume isn't getting the desired results, make changes and try different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The tragic death of a Wells Fargo employee highlights the critical need for robust [[company_communication_breakdown | workplace communication]] and [[corporate_trust_and_communication_issues | corporate accountability]]. In August 2023, 60-year-old Denise Prudhomme was found dead at her desk in a Wells Fargo office building in Tempe, Arizona, four days after she had clocked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Incident Overview
Denise Prudhomme entered the Wells Fargo corporate office building on August 16th at 7:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Her cubicle was located on the third floor, "tucked away" from the main aisle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. On August 20th, four full days later, building security officials were called regarding a "subject down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. An employee found Prudhomme dead in her cubicle, and officers pronounced her dead upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. She was likely deceased for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, with the discovery occurring approximately at the close of business on Monday, following her last entry on a Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Lack of Communication and Oversight
The incident brought to light a significant [[company_communication_breakdown | breakdown in communication]] and oversight within the workplace:
*   **Unnoticed Absence** Employees reportedly complained of a foul odor, attributing it to plumbing issues rather than realizing it was a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. No one realized Ms. Prudhomme was decomposing at her desk for four full days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Invisibility in the Workplace** No one seemed to notice Ms. Prudhomme's absence from meetings or her failure to submit reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The question was raised if she was "so invisible in your workplace that nobody even stops by to say hi to see how you're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Corporate Culture Critique** The situation prompted questions about the corporate culture where a person's absence goes unnoticed for so long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This is particularly ironic given that the finance industry, including Wells Fargo, has been "very adamant about forcing people back into the office" to experience a corporate office culture of "collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. It's noted that "clearly nobody's collaborating with her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Impact on Employees and Corporate Response
The news was heartbreaking for other employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, with one employee expressing fear that they too could be forgotten: "what if I was just sitting there would nobody would check on me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Another found it sickening that "nobody did anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

A Wells Fargo spokesman released a statement expressing sadness and offering thoughts and prayers to the family, stating that counselors were available and they were cooperating with the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, this response was perceived as insufficient, given the apparent lack of concern that preceded the discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Accountability and Employee Value
The incident raises significant questions about [[corporate_trust_and_communication_issues | corporate trust]] and accountability within workplaces:
*   **Managerial Responsibility** The question is posed, "where is the boss, is anybody ever checking in on just to even see what work she's producing or does she have to show up to any meetings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The speaker argues that a boss should be held accountable for not knowing their employee was in the building, never left, and "was literally expired up on the third floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Value of Employee Work** The speaker postulates that Ms. Prudhomme's work might not have been highly valued if her absence went unnoticed for so long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Employee Well-being** The story serves as a stark reminder for employees to prioritize their own [[the_importance_of_worklife_balance_and_employee_morale | health and wellness]] above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. It emphasizes the importance of taking sick days and vacations, as "you never know when your last day is going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Ultimately, the event underscores a workplace environment where individuals can become "a cog in a wheel, a number on a spreadsheet," and "people will not even notice you if you expire at work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It calls for individuals to "reclaim control," and "start to act like the CEO of your career because clearly nobody else is looking out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

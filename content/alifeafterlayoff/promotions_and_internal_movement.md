A significant indicator of a high-quality employer is a company's approach to [[hiring_practices_like_pipelining_and_internal_recruitment | internal recruitment]] and [[challenges_of_workplace_promotions | promotions from within]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Finding a company that genuinely invests in its employees' [[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | career advancement]] is often considered the "job seeker's holy grail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Promoting from Within

Great companies often have a culture of promoting their existing employees into more advanced roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While some companies may be resistant to this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, others actively encourage [[hiring_practices_like_pipelining_and_internal_recruitment | internal movement]] and boast a high percentage of employees progressing within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

A company's willingness to promote from within indicates that employees who apply themselves have a high likelihood of progressing their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Targeting such companies can be a powerful strategy for your [[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> [!question] Key Interview Question
> When interviewing, always ask the interviewer: "Why is the position open?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. If the response is that someone was promoted into a more advanced role, it's a strong positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Investment in Personal Development

Companies that invest in their employees' [[employee_satisfaction_and_career_changes | personal development]] are typically those with low turnover rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This investment includes:
*   Sending employees to additional training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Providing opportunities to demonstrate new or stretch skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Supporting attendance at conferences to stay current in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Such initiatives not only foster [[employee_satisfaction_and_career_changes | employee satisfaction]] but also build the skills necessary for internal [[challenges_of_workplace_promotions | promotion]] and [[career_advancement and company loyalty | career advancement]].

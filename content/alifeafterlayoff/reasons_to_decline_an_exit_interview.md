When you resign from a job, Human Resources may ask you to participate in an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While these interviews are often conducted with the intention of collecting data on employment trends, compensation, benefits, or manager performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, there are significant reasons why an employee might choose to decline participation.

## What is an Exit Interview?

An [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] is typically an invitation from Human Resources, usually in the last week of your employment, to collect data on overall trends within the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. The goal is for the company to understand why employees are leaving, such as issues with compensation, benefits, or a particular manager's high turnover rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This information is intended to help organizations address problems and potentially implement corrective actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

Common questions in an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] include:
*   Why did you decide to leave? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>
*   Where are you going and what position will you have? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>
*   What feedback can you provide? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>
*   How did you like your boss? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>
*   Would you consider returning in the future? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>

The information collected may be stored in your employment file or a generic HR file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Larger companies sometimes use third-party organizations to collect this data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## Reasons to Decline an Exit Interview

It is generally recommended not to participate in an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> for two primary reasons:

### 1. Not Required
Participation in an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] is strictly voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Companies cannot compel you to participate, nor can they take any adverse action against you, such as withholding a paycheck, if you decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### 2. No Gain, Potential Loss
As an employee, you stand to gain almost nothing from participating in an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]], but there is a significant risk of potential harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## [[potential_consequences_of_participating_in_an_exit_interview | Potential Consequences of Participating]]

While an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] might seem innocent, there is an inadvertent "dark side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. If you use the interview as an opportunity to vent about issues like a difficult boss, lack of promotional opportunities, underpayment, or a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>:

*   **Burning Bridges**: By airing grievances, you create a documented list of issues associated with your employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This could potentially burn a bridge with the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Future Re-hireability**: If you decide to seek re-employment with that organization in the future, they will likely reference these documents detailing why you left and how you expressed your feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. Negative feedback could classify you as "not hirable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Ineffectiveness**: The Human Resources representative conducting the interview typically doesn't make major decisions and is often less compensated than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. Your feedback is likely to "fall on deaf ears" and merely make you feel better in the moment, without resulting in actual change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

### What Exit Interview Information is NOT Shared

Contrary to some advice, information from your [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] is generally **not** shared with other potential employers during reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Companies can face legal trouble if they provide a new employer with detailed reasons for your departure beyond standard employment verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## When to Consider Participating

The only scenario where participating in an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] might be acceptable is if you are 100% certain you will **never** return to that employer in the future and you wish to express your complete thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. This is likely your only opportunity to convey your true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

Ultimately, if an employee is leaving due to valid issues within a department, the employer and particularly the boss should ideally already be aware of these problems through regular one-on-one discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. If your departure is a surprise to them, it reflects on the boss's awareness rather than a need for you to provide an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

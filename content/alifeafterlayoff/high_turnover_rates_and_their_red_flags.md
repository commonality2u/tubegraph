High turnover rates in a company are considered a significant red flag for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. A poor-quality employer will typically struggle to retain good employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Why High Turnover is a Concern

Companies with high turnover often exhibit other problematic characteristics, such as:
*   Unrealistic expectations not aligning with compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   Micromanaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Poor communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   High levels of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Identifying High Turnover During Your Job Search

To [[identifying_high_turnover_as_a_red_flag | identify high turnover]] and avoid [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flags in job opportunities]], consider the following:

*   **Ask Direct Questions**
    *   In an interview, inquire why the position is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   If the employer does not provide a valid reason, or admits previous occupants were terminated or left on their own, they must explain why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

*   **Utilize Glassdoor**
    *   Cross-reference company information with Glassdoor reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While reviews tend to be from upset former employees, look for common threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Recurring complaints about being micromanaged or not receiving promised bonuses could indicate [[common_red_flags_in_company_culture | cultural issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Ensure you ask the right questions in the interview to address these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **Observe Company Reputation**
    *   A company known for frequent layoffs or sudden firings is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   If employees are leaving on their own due to a poor work culture or subpar pay, this is another [[identifying_high_turnover_as_a_red_flag | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

By reading between the lines, consulting resources like Glassdoor, and asking pertinent questions during [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | job interviews]], you can better identify and avoid poor-quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Internship Expectations and Challenges

The modern job market often presents job seekers with absurd and ridiculous requirements, particularly concerning internships and entry-level positions. These demands highlight a significant disconnect between [[employer_expectations_vs_reality | employer expectations vs reality]] and the actual capabilities or appropriate compensation for candidates, especially recent college graduates or those transitioning into the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This phenomenon can be a fun way to poke holes at employers but more importantly, it serves as a crucial lesson for job seekers to recognize their own value and avoid applying for "garbage" opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Unrealistic Entry-Level Requirements

Many job postings demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of what constitutes an entry-level role or an internship, often demanding extensive experience or advanced qualifications for minimal pay.

#### Accounting Role: Experience vs. Compensation
A remote accounting role was advertised offering $1,400 a month, equating to $8.75 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The minimum requirements included two years of accounting experience with US-based businesses and a bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This compensation is often below minimum wage in some areas and certainly below poverty level, making it impossible to pay off student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. An entry-level accounting job should realistically offer around $45,000 to $50,000 annually, not $16,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

#### Combined Roles: Website Developer and Landscaper
Another example highlighted a part-time position in Calgary, Canada, for a "Website Business Developer" and "Landscaper" paying C$20-25 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. The role required someone with business acumen, website development, advertising skills, and the ability to sell services, yet up to 50% of the job involved physical labor like landscaping and snow removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Candidates were also required to be registered with a Canadian post-secondary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This illustrates an employer seeking multiple skilled roles for a single, low-paying, part-time position, highlighting [[challenges_and_insights_into_various_job_roles | challenges and insights into various job roles]] for individuals expected to perform wildly disparate tasks.

#### Internship Demands: Expert Knowledge for a Student Position
A four-month student internship position, starting in September 2023, demanded an "industry expert" with analytical skills, collaboration with data scientists, and execution of advisor monitoring programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Furthermore, it required advanced knowledge of insurance and wealth products, understanding of advisor compensation, knowledge of internal admin systems, a post-secondary education, AND professional designations like CPA, CFA, or CSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. These [[employer_expectations_from_recent_college_graduates | employer expectations from recent college graduates]] are "so skewed from reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a> and are nearly impossible for an intern to meet, especially for a likely unpaid or very low-paid position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. This highlights significant [[challenges_of_transitioning_from_college_to_workforce | challenges of transitioning from college to workforce]].

### The Problem of Unpaid Work

A recurring red flag in job postings is the expectation of unpaid labor from candidates, either during the interview process or as a condition of employment, particularly common with startups. This is a significant concern regarding [[issues_with_unpaid_work_expectations | issues with unpaid work expectations]].

#### Unpaid Interview "Test Runs"
Some employers expect candidates to come in and "work for a couple of hours to see if you like the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. When asked if the candidate would be paid, the response was "No, not for that day. This is for you to get a feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. A reputable company would not put someone through a test work day without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. If a candidate questions this, they are often dismissed as "not a good fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

#### Unpaid Startup Roles with Vague Promises
A "Marketing Manager / Chief Marketing Officer" position for a startup explicitly stated that initially, the candidate would "work with the founding team as we secure VC funding on a part-time unpaid basis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Only after securing funding would the role transition to full-time paid, with potential for executive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This is seen as a "proverbial carrot hanging in front of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Such companies are unlikely to succeed as they are not attracting qualified professionals when offering no compensation, and the promise of future equity is often too far down the line to be realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Self-Respect and Unpaid Work
> Job seekers should never show up and give free work if they are not being compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Similarly, be cautious if asked to produce extensive projects (like case studies or presentations for actual business scenarios) during the interview process without compensation, as companies might be seeking free consultative services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Other Red Flags in the Job Market

Beyond unpaid work and unrealistic expectations, other signs indicate a "red flag employer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

#### Excessive Employee Handbook Charges
One extreme example was an employee handbook for a restaurant that listed a series of charges to be deducted from an employee's final pay if they left the organization within a certain period. These included fees for the handbook ($10), training manual, file processing, payroll processing, W-2 processing, uniform costs, and even "training costs" ($25 a day) and "hiring processing costs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Such practices are "unheard of" and indicate an anti-employee culture, likely stemming from previous bad experiences with high turnover in lower-level positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

#### Interview Punctuality as a Rejection Criteria
A recruiter rejected a candidate for a full-time role because they "arrived at [their] interview exactly on time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, suggesting that arriving earlier would show more keenness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This is an "absolutely ridiculous reason to reject somebody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> and signals an overly power-hungry hiring manager.

#### Deceitful Pay Transparency
In states with pay transparency laws, some companies post extremely wide salary ranges (e.g., $150,000 to $890,000 for a base salary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This strategy is seen as shady, doing "nothing for the job seeker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. It's an attempt to comply with the law while avoiding actual disclosure, potentially misleading candidates about realistic compensation and reflecting poorly on the company's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This contributes to the [[current_job_market_challenges | challenges in the current job market]].

#### Absurd Application Requirements
Some job applications include bizarre requests, such as attaching "a photo of the inside of your fridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. While possibly "tongue-in-cheek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, such requests indicate either a recruiter "gone rogue" or a hiring manager with unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>, contributing to a cumbersome interview process at best, or a red flag employer at worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Identifying Red Flag Employers
> Employers who exhibit these behaviors (unrealistic expectations, unpaid work, deceptive practices, absurd demands) are "low quality employers for a reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. These ridiculous postings are actually doing job seekers a favor by clearly indicating which companies to avoid, saving time and potential future career stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Job seekers should prioritize self-respect and avoid such employers, as they rarely lead to career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

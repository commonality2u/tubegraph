The human resources (HR) department is sometimes seen as having a negative reputation, and certain practices can be considered "shady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. One such practice involves confidential job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## What Are Confidential Job Postings?
A confidential job posting is identified when the company's name is either blanked out or explicitly stated as "confidential" in the job advertisement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These are internal terms for what is known as a "confidential requisition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Reasons for Confidentiality
The most common reason for a company to post a confidential job is that they are actively seeking to replace an employee who is currently in the role, without that employee's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This allows the company to get a head start on finding a replacement before informing the current employee of their impending termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. They might even wait to terminate the current employee until a new hire is ready to step in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Implications for Job Seekers
For job seekers, encountering a confidential job posting raises an important question: do you want to work for a company that would replace an employee behind their back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>? If a company engages in this practice with one employee, there is a chance they could do the same to you in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This approach to employment arrangements may not be an ideal start to a new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

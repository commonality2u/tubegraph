The Human Resources (HR) department often has a reputation for certain "shady" practices, and confidential job postings are one example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These are considered a [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:42">[04:13:42]</a>.

## What Are Confidential Job Postings?

A confidential job posting is one where the company's name is either blanked out or listed as "confidential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:38">[04:14:38]</a>. This means the job is designated as a "confidential requisition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:49">[04:21:49]</a>.

## Why Are They Used?

The most common reason a company posts a confidential job is that they are actively seeking to replace the person currently in that role, without that individual's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>. If the company were to publish its name along with the job title, the current employee might realize they are being replaced, which could cause internal disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:40">[04:41:40]</a>.

Essentially, the company is being [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | shady]] by getting a head start on replacing an employee without informing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>. The strategy is to have a replacement ready to go before terminating the current employee, or to delay termination until the new hire is secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:34">[04:58:34]</a>.

## Implications for Job Seekers

For a job seeker, encountering a confidential job posting raises an important question: "Do I really want to work for a company who would replace me right behind my back and then tell me as soon as my new replacement is walking in to take my desk?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:18">[05:08:18]</a>.

> [!caution] Warning for Job Seekers
> If a company engages in this practice for one employee, they can certainly do it for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:54">[05:19:54]</a>. Starting an employment arrangement this way is generally not advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:28">[05:24:28]</a>.

Confidential job postings are a "shady" practice often employed by Human Resources (HR) departments that job seekers should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## What Are Confidential Job Postings?
These are job advertisements where the company's name is either blanked out or listed as "confidential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The term "confidential req" (requisition) refers to a job posting that is kept secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Why HR Uses Them
The most common reason for a company to post a confidential job is that they are actively seeking to replace the current employee in that position, without the employee knowing they are being replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If the company were to reveal its name along with the job title, the current employee might discover the posting and cause internal disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This practice allows the company to get a head start on finding a replacement before informing the current employee of their impending termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. In some cases, the company might even delay terminating the current employee until a new hire is secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Implications for Job Seekers
As a job seeker encountering a confidential job posting, it's worth considering if you want to work for a company that would replace an employee behind their back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The speaker suggests that if a company engages in such practices with one employee, they could do the same to you in the future, which is not an ideal start to an employment arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

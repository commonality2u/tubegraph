Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, especially when dealing with "low quality employers" who ask suspicious questions that may indicate an ulterior motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Employers often give "tells" during interviews that can help discern whether an opportunity is low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Paying close attention to these red flags can help job seekers avoid a headache altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Red Flag Interview Questions

Certain questions posed by interviewers can signal a potentially [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace dynamics]] or [[negative_workplace_culture | negative workplace culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>:

### 1. "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
While seemingly innocent, this question can indicate an employer's hyper-focus on attendance due to past [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | attendance issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It suggests a potentially inflexible workplace that might not allow for calling off sick without repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If an employer is "really cracking down on it," it's likely an indicator of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Job seekers should ask about expectations around unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### 2. "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
This question directly asks "how cheap can we be" to hire you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. It indicates a lack of flexibility and suggests the employer will likely try to lowball during salary negotiations and continue to "nickel and dime" you during raises or promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### 3. "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
This question strongly suggests a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | turnover issue]] within the company, indicating they struggle to retain employees in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. It's a sign that there might be a larger [[negative_workplace_culture | cultural problem]] that causes people to leave quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### 4. "Have you ever been fired?"
An employer asking this question is delving into an area that is generally "not any of their business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Past employment decisions do not always predict future performance, as a past firing could simply be due to a "bad situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If an interviewer continues to probe after a candidate redirects to focus on future accomplishments, it's a strong indicator of an employer to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### 5. Accusations of Embellishing Your Resume
If an interviewer accuses you of "exaggerating or embellishing any part of your resume" (assuming you haven't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, it means they already don't trust you, or they assume all candidates are lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This is a clear [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | sign of a toxic employer]] and predictive of the lack of trust you might experience in that culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### 6. "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
Considered a "trap question," this inquiry provides little useful information and risks an employer using the answer as a bias against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While it might aim to understand how one overcomes adversity, it's poorly phrased and focuses negatively on failures rather than successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### 7. Questions about Off-Shift or Weekend Availability
For roles advertised with specific shifts (hourly or salary), asking about "availability on off shifts or over weekends" suggests a likelihood of working unwanted overtime and a significant work-life imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For remote positions, asking about "availability to come on site" indicates it's likely a hybrid role misrepresented as fully remote, and could eventually become 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Always seek clear expectations for work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### 8. "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
This question immediately raises concerns about the workplace environment, suggesting that the candidate will be "working with a bunch of a-holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. If the manager is implied to be rude, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This is a strong [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | sign of a cultural issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### 9. Lack of Opportunity for Candidate Questions
If an interviewer dominates the conversation and does not allow the candidate to ask questions at the end, it's a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This indicates that the employer forgets an interview is a "two-way street" where the candidate should also assess the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. If an employer takes offense to a candidate asking professional questions, they may believe they are "above you" and should not be assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

Encountering one or two of these questions doesn't definitively mean a company is poor quality, but they serve as important data points and [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | indicators of potential deeper cultural issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. It's crucial to ask probing questions to understand the company culture fully before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

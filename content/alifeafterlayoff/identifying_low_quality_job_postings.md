When searching for new opportunities, it's crucial for job seekers to develop an eye for identifying [[identifying_low_quality_employers | poor quality employers]] and [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags in job advertisements]] in job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Recognizing these signs can help you avoid wasting time on [[cringeworthy_job_postings | cringeworthy job posts]] and bad recruitment processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Common Red Flags in Job Postings

### Desired Salary Field
When a job posting asks for your desired salary, it's a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Too Low**: Risks getting underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Too High**: Risks rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Be true to your actual financial needs and even pad the number slightly, as this figure often forms the basis for an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Don't be afraid to scare off [[identifying_low_quality_employers | low-quality opportunities]] that would only waste your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Know your realistic market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Vague or Desperate Language
Be wary of job postings that show signs of desperation or a lack of clear focus:
*   **Multiple Employment Types**: If a job listing states "full-time, part-time, or contract," it suggests the employer is struggling to find candidates and is using a "shotgun approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **High Response Rate/Urgent Hiring**: Phrases like "responds to 51-74% of applications" and "urgently hiring" can indicate an employer is desperate and applying to anything that sticks, signalling a [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Bait-and-Switch Salary Ranges
A significant [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] is when the advertised pay range differs drastically from the detailed description within the posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. For example, if a job is initially listed at $25-$30/hour but the description later states $10-$14/hour, this is a "complete crap posting" and a sign of a "super [[identifying_low_quality_employers | low-quality employer]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This tactic is used to "bait anybody into" applying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   **Inappropriate Pay for Role**: A remote Executive Administrative Assistant role paying $10-$14/hour, while the industry standard is well into six figures, is a huge [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Location-Based Pay for Remote Roles**: If a remote job's pay depends on location, it's illogical as location should not impact compensation for a remote position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **"Only apply if willing to start at that pay range"**: After a bait-and-switch, this statement further highlights the employer's poor practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Candidate Dictates Pay Raise**: A company expecting candidates to suggest "skills and actions" they need to learn to earn more instead of paying a market wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Unprofessional or Concerning Culture Descriptions
Phrases in job descriptions that hint at a potentially toxic or unbalanced work environment are major [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **"We work and party like crazy" / "Work hard, play hard"**: This often signifies a terrible and toxic work culture with no work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It can mean you'll work "tons of hours" and likely won't get paid much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **"Fast growth... if you like working hard"**: While "fast growth" might sound appealing, coupled with "working hard," it indicates a likelihood of "no work-life balance at all" and working "a ton of hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **"Big money if you stay long enough"**: This is a classic "bait and switch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. It suggests low starting pay, dangling a carrot of future earnings without clear timelines or guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Companies using this often have "extremely high turnover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **"Lots to flaunt about once you get there"**: Vague and unprofessional language that doesn't convey any tangible benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Unreasonable Candidate Expectations
Watch out for job postings that place undue burdens on candidates during the application process:
*   **"Discomfort with ambiguity and stretch"**: This implies a chaotic environment where job duties are unclear, you'll be "wearing multiple hats," and goals are potentially unattainable ("stretch") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **"Discomfort with complexity"**: Suggests a highly challenging and potentially overwhelming role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **"Looking for a work-life balance" (as a negative trait)**: This is a massive [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Companies that use this often claim to practice "work-life integration," which means you're expected to be available 24/7, answering emails at night and working weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Excessive and Uncompensated Interview Processes
Companies with overly demanding or long hiring processes, especially without compensation, are often [[identifying_low_quality_employers | low-quality employers]].
*   **Unpaid Assignments**: Giving candidates extensive assignments (e.g., 8-12 hours of work, an entire weekend) with only one person being hired is "uncandidate-focused" and an unreasonable "cost-benefit ratio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
    *   Example: A company boasting a screening process that includes a "test project" taking "one to three weeks" for candidates to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. If uncompensated, this is "absolutely ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. This can also lead to companies taking candidates' "intellectual property" to solve their own business problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.
*   **Multi-Stage Screening with Low Pass Rates**: A company that brags about extremely low pass rates at each stage of their interview process (e.g., 26.4% pass personality profile, 7.4% pass skill review, 3.6% pass live screen, 3.2% pass test projects) is indicative of an excessive, time-consuming process that can take "two and five weeks to complete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Job seekers should ask if this is worth their time, given the low chance of an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

### Lack of Transparency and Bait-and-Switch on Job Type
*   **Unwillingness to State Pay**: A small business owner who states, "if you need to ask how much I will pay then you obviously do not really need the work," is a [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. If an employer isn't transparent about pay, "you really don't need the help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This often points to a "crappy company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Contract First, Full-Time Later**: When a company initially offers a contract role but "miraculously" finds a full-time opportunity after a candidate pushes back, it indicates they were trying to "lowball" the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. This is a sign that the company is trying to get candidates to "bite on a crappy offer" before presenting a more reasonable one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

## Conclusion
Being vigilant about these [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | subtle red flags]] in job postings is crucial for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Asking hard questions and screening out [[identifying_low_quality_employers | low-quality employers]] can prevent you from ending up with a bad job that might weaken your resume and make future job searches harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

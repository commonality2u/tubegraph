When engaged in a job search, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution regarding what information is disclosed, especially to co-workers and within the workplace, to avoid potential negative consequences for one's current employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Confidentiality of Job Search Activities

It is strongly advised to avoid telling co-workers that you are in an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Information about your job search can quickly spread through workplace whispers and gossip, potentially reaching your boss, senior leaders, or the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. If your employer discovers you are seeking new employment, it could lead to your premature exit from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This caution is an important aspect of [[strategies_for_job_searching_in_a_competitive_market | strategies for job searching]] and [[strategies_to_improve_job_search_outcomes | improving job search outcomes]].

### Resume and Profile Visibility

To maintain privacy during a job search, be exceptionally careful about where you upload your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:
*   Avoid uploading a resume that lists your current company or job to public resume databases like Indeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Do not upload such a resume to your current LinkedIn profile and then set yourself as "available to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Sharing Salary Information

While salary transparency is generally supported for leveling the playing field, it is not recommended to discuss your specific salary with co-workers within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   Sharing salary details can lead to others realizing they are underpaid, causing upset, resignations, or demands for higher compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   This can lead management to distrust individuals involved in such discussions, potentially hindering future promotions, even if there are legitimate reasons for salary differences (e.g., skill, experience, changes in the job market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Instead, share salary information anonymously on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind (for tech professionals) to help others understand fair compensation for roles without personal blowback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This aligns with advice on [[importance_of_avoiding_personal_identifiers_on_resumes | avoiding personal identifiers]] in sensitive contexts.

### Other Information to Avoid Disclosing

To protect your career and avoid professional issues, refrain from discussing the following with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, aligning with broader [[strategies_for_protecting_your_career | strategies for career protection]]:

*   **Negative opinions about your boss:** Even with a trusted work ally, negative comments can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Gossip about co-workers:** Engaging in gossip can damage your reputation and lead to complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The boss often finds out regardless of how careful you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Borrowing money or engaging in business ventures:** Financial dealings with co-workers can lead to sticky situations and often end poorly, potentially causing discomfort or reports to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Compliments on physical attributes:** Even if perceived as innocent, such comments can be misinterpreted and make others uncomfortable, leading to HR complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Keep compliments professional and avoid anything creepy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This is part of [[personal_information_to_avoid_sharing_in_interviews | personal information to avoid sharing]].
*   **Pregnancy announcements:** Do not assume or call out a colleague's pregnancy. Let them disclose it on their own terms, as doing so prematurely or incorrectly can be offensive or force an undesired announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Intent to sue the company:** Discussing potential litigation or spilling "dirt" on the company with co-workers can allow the company to take proactive defensive measures, jeopardizing your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This information should only be shared with an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Off-color jokes:** Jokes that you consider innocent can be offensive to others. It is how the joke is *received*, not *intended*, that matters. Stick to professional or "dumb dad jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Political opinions:** Avoid discussing political topics in the workplace as it is a "hot button" issue that inevitably leads to arguments and can offend colleagues, regardless of which side you align with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Maintaining professionalism in this area can prevent legal trouble and protect your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Treat co-workers with a high degree of professionalism and be very careful about what you say and disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

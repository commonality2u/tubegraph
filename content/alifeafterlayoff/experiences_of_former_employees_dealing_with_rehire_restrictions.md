Have you ever applied to a company, especially a former employer, despite being qualified, only to find yourself unable to secure even a basic interview or get hired? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> This scenario, often referred to as "blacklisting," is a reality, with companies like Meta confirming they maintain block lists for former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This article explores what it means to be on such a list, how individuals discover they are blocked, and potential actions to consider.

## Meta's "Do Not Hire" List

A recent expos√© by Business Insider revealed that former Meta employees are being blocked from rehire, placed on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This practice, while suspected, was confirmed to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Case Study: A Senior Engineer's Experience
A senior engineer, impacted by Meta's large-scale layoffs in 2022 (which included over 10,000 people and were initially stated not to be performance-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, found themselves on this list.
*   This engineer had consistently received "exceeding expectations" ratings, one of Meta's strongest performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   They were tenured, having worked for four years, and had earned a senior technical promotion a year prior to layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Their work was praised by their skip-level manager as "critical to the company's success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   The layoff was described as a "business decision" and "not personal" or "performance related" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Despite multiple hiring managers expressing interest in bringing them back, the engineer was blocked by human resources policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

After applying for nearly 20 positions within Meta over a year, the engineer noticed a pattern: hiring managers would show interest and recruiters would set up screening calls, but then the internal recruiter would "ghost" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. When the engineer inquired, the hiring manager discovered that the recruiting team had forbidden contact because the engineer was "deemed ineligible for rehire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This was the first indication for the engineer that they were on a "list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Meta's Internal Tracking Systems
Meta reportedly uses multiple internal systems to track rehire ineligibility, including a "non-regrettable attrition designation" and a "do not hire flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While the exact mechanisms and number of affected individuals remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, most companies do track such information, typically within their HRIS (Human Resources Information System) rather than just the applicant tracking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Recruiters often cannot directly see these flags and must consult HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Criteria for Being Blacklisted
Meta claims there is "clear criteria" for being marked ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. These criteria reportedly include:
*   Reason for separation at the time of departure (e.g., quitting without notice, "rage quitting") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
*   Policy violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   Performance termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
*   Involuntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
*   Voluntary separation, depending on circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   Last ratings prior to separation and any other performance signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>

However, former managers claim they had "broad discretion" to add names to this list "without documented performance issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. It could take minutes for a manager to mark someone as "non-regrettable" attrition, indicating they were happy for the person to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. If a manager didn't like an employee, it was reportedly easy to put them on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Impact of Changing Layoff Narratives
Initially, Meta's 2022 layoffs were presented as non-performance-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, Meta later shifted its stance, declaring future layoffs would be "performance-based" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This change means that former Meta employees laid off in the past year now carry a "scarlet letter" of being deemed poor performers and ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This can create bias among hiring managers in Silicon Valley, making it harder for individuals who were fine performers but caught on the wrong side of Meta's rehiring systems to find new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

These rehire restrictions create an "invisible barrier" in an already [[issues_with_the_current_job_market_and_hiring_practices|competitive job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Individuals often don't know they are on such a list because companies won't disclose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Many discover it through a third-party headhunting agency or recruiter who attempts to submit their candidacy and is informed by the company that the individual is on a "do not hire list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Blacklisting Beyond Former Employers

Formal blacklisting often occurs when there's a prior employment relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. However, individuals can also be informally blacklisted even if they have never worked for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Informal Blacklisting Through Application Volume
If a candidate applies for the same job repeatedly, or for numerous different, unrelated jobs within one company (e.g., 30-40 applications), it can lead to an informal bias against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Staffing teams and hiring managers may see this activity and wonder why the candidate hasn't been hired by other teams, leading to suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

*   **Example from Amazon**: At Amazon, if candidates failed interview "loops" with other hiring teams, their disposition status and a "recycle period" would be noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   For technical skill deficiencies, a candidate might be recycled after six months, allowing them to reapply after practicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   However, if removed for failing a "leadership principle" (behavior-based interview), there was often no recycling, effectively a permanent ban from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Spamming Resumes**: Applying for every single job on an applicant tracking system, especially if the jobs are completely unrelated, appears "spammy" and can lead to informal blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

### Backdoor References
A "backdoor reference" occurs when someone on a hiring team knows someone who worked at a candidate's previous company and contacts them for an unofficial opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. These informal references can sink a candidate's chances and potentially lead to them being blacklisted, often without the candidate's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This is particularly common in smaller industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

While some employers actively use "do not hire" lists, this practice is not believed to be widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Individuals are encouraged not to dwell on specific companies' policies, especially if they are seen as "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The focus should be on [[reclaiming_control_over_career_paths_and_dealing_with_corporate_policies|reclaiming control over career paths]] and building a career with "high conviction and authority," rather than being at the mercy of employers who "play games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

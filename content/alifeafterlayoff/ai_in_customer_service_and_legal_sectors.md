The rise of [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_job_market_changes | artificial intelligence]] (AI) is significantly impacting various job sectors, particularly customer service and legal roles. Companies are increasingly investing in AI, leading to a reevaluation of traditional human roles and contributing to layoffs across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This shift suggests that AI is not just a future speculation but a present reality that is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## AI in Customer Service
AI, especially through natural language chatbots, is making many customer service and sales roles redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This trend is already evident:
*   Google, for instance, has impacted hundreds in its ads division by switching to AI-powered sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The company now utilizes generative AI features and natural language chatbots to perform tasks previously handled by human sales agents, such as sales guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   IBM announced plans in May 2023 to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI, primarily in back-office functions like Human Resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The transition is expected to gradually affect 30% of non-customer-facing roles (including Finance, Accounting, and HR) over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. AI bots are already proficient at generating HR letters and boilerplate text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   An Indian CEO replaced 90% of support staff with AI chatbots, citing increased efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This points to a future where contacting a human for customer service may become increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

A survey by Resume Builder found that 44% of companies anticipate AI replacing employees in the coming year, as CEOs actively seek ways to implement AI aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## AI in Legal Sectors
The legal field is also susceptible to [[ai_replacing_human_roles_in_technology_and_media | AI replacing human roles]]:
*   AI is particularly adept at tasks that are simple to execute, such as following a script or drafting standard legal documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Roles like paralegals and legal assistants, which often involve significant "grunt work" or technical writing, can be performed very efficiently by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   There are even discussions of an AI-powered robot lawyer representing a defendant in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Broader Implications and [[impact_of_ai_on_job_security | Job Security]]
Overall, AI is automating a range of tasks, including creative work, writing, administrative, and clerical duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Tasks most likely to be displaced are mundane, such as writing ad copy or a first draft of a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. AI software can perform these tasks more cheaply, thereby devaluing human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

An executive predicted that between 15% and 70% of computer-based work could be automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While AI is often presented as a tool to improve jobs and automate mundane tasks, the data suggests that companies are using it to replace roles for cost-saving measures, even if it means sacrificing creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> [[impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_employment | The impact of technology and AI on employment]] is significant, and while some believe AI will only assist, current trends indicate job displacement, especially in roles involving repetitive or data-heavy tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_futureproof_careers_against_ai | Strategies to Futureproof Careers]]
To [[strategies_to_futureproof_careers_against_ai | futureproof careers]] against AI, individuals should:
*   Stay informed about industry trends and potential AI impacts on their job type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   Upgrade skills and develop a niche that is less susceptible to AI replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   Learn how to leverage AI tools within their current role to enhance efficiency and justify their continued value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   Maintain an updated resume, market themselves effectively, and build a strong personal brand and network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This includes understanding [[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | ATS compliance]] for resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   Explore targeted networking to bypass AI recruiters and directly engage with hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

The [[role_of_ai_in_the_recruitment_process | role of AI in the recruitment process]] could make it harder for job seekers, as AI robots scan resumes analytically, potentially overlooking transferable skills for career changers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

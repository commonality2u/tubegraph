A stable job can be detrimental to one's career, contrary to common belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the value of [[the_role_of_loyalty_in_career_progression | loyalty]], stability, and hard work is ingrained early on, there comes a point where this mentality can be harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of "Paying Your Dues": The Story of Joe

Joe, an entry-level accountant who earned his CPA and steadily worked his way up the salary band with merit increases, exemplified [[corporate_loyalty_and_employee_preparedness | company loyalty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He received decent reviews and took on occasional projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When his boss left, Joe applied for the leadership role, hoping to be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, the organization saw him as a "good, solid worker bee" but lacked confidence in his leadership potential, hiring an external candidate instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Despite being deflated, Joe continued to work, expecting his day for advancement to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Years later, a new entry-level hire was making only $8,000 less than him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Joe justified his compensation by benefits like his 401k vesting, third week of vacation, and an upcoming bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

At his 10-year mark, during a company rough patch and rumors of downsizing, Joe felt secure due to his tenure and knowledge of business processes, assuming he was "next in line for the promotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, he was laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The years of "paying his dues" and [[hidden_costs_of_company_loyalty | company loyalty]] were instantly disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Entering the job market, he realized peers, even younger than him, had already achieved the promotions he sought, placing him at least five years behind in his [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career progression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Staying in his position for so long ultimately hurt him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Joe is considered an "average candidate" – steady but unspectacular, with skills but lacking aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. He waited for opportunities instead of pursuing them, which causes him to blend into the crowd when competing against hundreds of similar applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## The Power of Strategic Career Management: The Story of Jill

Jill started her career as an entry-level accountant at the same time as Joe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Early on, she knew she wanted to lead a finance team and created a master plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Her plan included:
*   **Obtaining a CPA** almost immediately after starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Seeking Project Experience and Leadership Opportunities** by identifying improvements in her department and presenting them to her manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This led to increased responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Networking for Visibility** with other departmental heads, gaining invitations to project groups and spreading her reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Not long after, Jill received a promotion to a team lead role with a modest salary increase, gaining direct leadership experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. However, she recognized that her boss, a "lifer," was blocking her upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. While she loved the company, they couldn't offer the next role she needed for her [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career path]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Jill leveraged her network at an industry event, mentioning she felt blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Within months, a contact offered her a position she couldn't refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. After just three years, she moved to a new major corporation, receiving a 30% pay bump and the position her previous boss had blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This was the exact experience she needed for her [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. In three years, Jill surpassed Joe in terms of level, experience, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Jill is a "superstar candidate" – aggressive, clear about her goals, and unwilling to let job stability hinder her [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career progression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Reconsidering Company Loyalty

While loyalty is a valued characteristic, it should not be detrimental to your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. It is crucial to define your [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Without a clear path, individuals risk a series of uninspired roles, becoming an "average Joe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. If mid-career with no defined goal, a change into something more passionate may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Jill's [[career_advancement_through_selfinterest | selfinterest]] meant every move was targeted toward her end goal, avoiding "non-value-added positions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Individuals should think of themselves as "free agents," like athletes who offer their services to the team offering the best opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Top free agents constantly hone their skills to increase their market value and secure the best opportunities and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. You owe the company nothing more than a fair effort for fair pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>; without an agent, you must create your own opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

This approach does not advocate for [[impact_of_job_hopping_on_career_progression | job hopping]] every time an opportunity is missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Learning a position and its required skills, developing skills, networking, and understanding company culture are crucial for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, if truly ready for the next step and blocked at your current company, it's a sign to update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

A person who leaves a position for a few extra dollars without a clear purpose is perceived as a "job hopper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. In contrast, someone who leaves for a very calculated [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career progression]] is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Recruiters understand when a company lacks opportunities or adequate mentorship for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Therefore, every position accepted, even a lateral move, should have a strong, clear purpose as part of a larger strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Salary and Compensation

Income is a primary motivator for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. It's important to add value, and income will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Staying current on salary trends ensures fair compensation, and with performance data, asking for a raise is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

However, a significant disadvantage of staying at the same company and position for too long is that salaries will almost certainly lag behind the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Most companies offer annual merit increases of only 1-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. In contrast, promotional opportunities or moving to a new company can result in a 10-30% salary bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This can lead to situations where new, entry-level hires make within $10,000 of senior employees with over a decade of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The open market will pass by those who stay in a position too long, unless they receive substantial internal promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

The decision to stay in a steady job depends on individual priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. If valuing a steady paycheck over [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career growth]], there's nothing wrong with maintaining the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. However, if stuck in an undercompensated role or blocked from achieving [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career goals]], it's time to consider a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Proactive individuals who actively seize opportunities will succeed faster in reaching their [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Being a "superstar candidate" also reduces the likelihood of unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

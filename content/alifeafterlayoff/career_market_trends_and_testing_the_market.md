It is important to look for a new job at least once every two years, even if you are satisfied in your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This approach encourages individuals to take ownership of their careers and avoid complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Risk of Complacency: Career Progression & Compensation

Staying in a job for too long can cause the [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] to pass people by, affecting both career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. To act like the CEO of your career or a free agent, it's crucial to consistently monitor [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Case Study: The Underpaid Performer

An individual working in the medical field, a high-demand sector, spent seven to eight years with their employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Despite being a top performer and having received promotions, their department experienced nearly 100% turnover in 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### The Offer & The Counter

Seeking new opportunities through their network, this individual received a job offer paying $5 an hour more than their current compensation, though it came with a longer commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Upon informing their current employer of their intent to leave, they were given a $15 an hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The employer's reasoning was to prevent losing more people from the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Employer Motivation

This scenario raises questions about why employers wait until an employee is tendering their resignation to offer proper compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It suggests that companies might be significantly underpaying employees, especially in a tight labor [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]], until a mass exodus forces them to address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It's likely a combination of underpayment and a desire to retain top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Company Pay Philosophies

Companies often adopt different pay philosophies:
*   **Pay Leaders** aim to retain talent by paying competitively and can poach talent from other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggards** have a compensation philosophy where they tolerate high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

However, constantly replacing employees becomes more expensive due to recruiting costs, training, and the loss of intellectual and tribal knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The employee in the case study accepted the counter offer, valuing the comfort of familiarity with processes and colleagues, and established benefits like vacation time and 401ks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While generally not recommended, a $15 an hour raise is a significant incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

> "The grass oftentimes is not greener because you may thought you had a really bad but you might jump to another company and realize that man I actually had it pretty good where I was." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

Some individuals who participated in the "great resignation" have experienced "boomeranging," returning to previous employers after finding new roles less fulfilling despite higher salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## The Strategy: Testing the Open Market

Testing the open market is a critical [[career_strategies_for_adapting_to_market_changes | strategy for individuals to prepare for job market changes]] that everyone should practice, even when satisfied with their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Why and How Often

At a minimum, you should be testing the open market every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This involves:
*   Putting out applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Networking with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Benefits of Testing the Market

The purpose of testing the market is to:
*   Keep tabs on [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Go through the interview process to understand required skills and assessment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   Reach the offer stage to engage in salary discussions and determine if you are underpaid relative to the [[researching_market_value_for_your_skills_and_geographic_region | market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Understand where the [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] is trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

It's important to use external offers carefully and selectively when leveraging them with your current employer, as they may call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Wage Stagnation and Market Shifts

If you stay in a role for a long time, the [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] will inevitably pass you by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Companies hiring new talent from outside often offer 10-20% raises, which impacts the overall [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Internal vs. External Growth

While internal promotions might offer a 5-10% bump every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, the external [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] typically moves up at a faster rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This can lead to a situation where new, less experienced hires are making the same or more than long-term employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Impact of Inflation

Small, incremental cost-of-living adjustments (1-3% raises) are often insufficient to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. For example, in an economy with 7% inflation, a raise below that means you are effectively making less money for the same job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This contributes to significant wage stagnation where individuals can be underpaid by substantial amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Recruiters performing internal pay comparisons often find departments 20-30% below [[researching_market_value_for_your_skills_and_geographic_region | market]] rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. If you are not actively testing the [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] or pushing for raises, companies may take advantage of your lack of complaint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. If the [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] passes you by too far, it becomes nearly impossible to catch up unless your company implements a major salary adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Conclusion: Proactive Career Management

Proactive career management involves consistently keeping abreast of changing [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | market]] conditions, especially given [[market_instability_and_employment_trends | current economic trends and job hopping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. If you receive a major salary increase only when announcing your intent to leave, it indicates you were underpaid from the start and not valued properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

When the job market feels impossible and employer requirements appear "completely out of touch," it's a common sentiment backed by evidence of "hidden job requirements" [00:00:00]. These often stem from biases held by hiring managers within corporations [03:11:00].

## The Accidental Leak of Internal Guidelines
A significant incident highlighted the presence of these hidden requirements: a recruiter accidentally emailed a technical candidate their company's "secret internal selection guidelines" [01:16:00]. The candidate expressed feeling "pissed off" by the "sheer pretentiousness and elitism" revealed in the document [01:34:00]. These guidelines were provided by the "hiring authorities" at the company, typically the hiring manager, and were not part of the public job posting [01:22:00].

## Dynamics Between Hiring Managers and Recruiters
Hiring managers are responsible for creating the initial list of qualifications, which includes "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications) [02:05:00]. While "requirements" are usually obvious (e.g., core experience in software development), the "prefers" section is where "hiring manager bias" often becomes evident [02:55:00].

Although job seekers might blame recruiters for perceived biases, the bias frequently originates with the [[Understanding Recruiter and Hiring Manager Dynamics | hiring manager]] or the hiring team [03:04:00]. A competent recruiter should challenge unrealistic requirements, especially if they are likely to "eliminate a lot of good candidates" [03:22:00]. However, this pushback may not occur, particularly with less experienced recruiters who are unfamiliar with job profiles or market conditions [03:33:00]. These guidelines are typically discussed during an "intake call" between the recruiter and the hiring manager when a job requisition is opened [03:51:00].

## Examples of Hidden Hiring Manager Biases

An internal memo, inadvertently shared, detailed explicit criteria for a software development role, revealing what a hiring manager was "looking for" and "what to avoid" [08:56:00].

### Desired Candidate Profile
*   **Education:** University graduate with a Bachelor's or Master's degree in computer science from a "top program" (e.g., MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, University of Waterloo) [05:47:00]. A special exception might be made for 4.0 graduates from a "couple of other schools" [06:31:00].
*   **Experience Level:** Strictly 4 to 10 years of software development experience [06:42:00]. Candidates with only two years of experience, even if highly skilled, would not be considered [06:48:00].
*   **Technical Skills:** Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), Cotlin, and knowledge of AI and machine learning [06:56:00].
*   **Job Stability:** Longevity in roles, requiring "two years plus in each role." "Job hoppers" are not a fit [07:13:00].
*   **Company Background:** Significant experience in notable startups, especially those backed by Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital [07:40:00].
*   **Diversity (Bonus):** Black, female, etc. [08:16:00].
*   **Citizenship/Residency:** US citizen, US permanent resident (green card holder), or Canadian citizen. No visa sponsorships [08:21:00].
*   **Founder Experience:** Bonus for being a "founding engineer" or having "founder experience" [08:43:00].

### Explicitly Avoided Candidates
The memo also outlined categories of candidates that the hiring manager did *not* want to see, indicating strong biases [08:57:00]:
*   **Visa Candidates:** Not considered [08:59:00].
*   **Career Contractors:** Candidates who have worked as contractors are not a fit; only permanent employment is desired [09:03:00].
*   **Job Hoppers:** Individuals with "frequent short stints" are to be avoided [09:16:00]. This applies even if job changes were due to layoffs from company closures or toxic workplaces [09:21:00].
*   **Coding Bootcamp Graduates:** Graduates of coding bootcamps (e.g., Full Stack Academy, Hacked Reactor) are not considered capable of coding [09:31:00].
*   **Consulting Background:** Candidates from IT software development firms or consulting backgrounds are not considered to have the "competency to launch whatever product they have" [09:50:00].
*   **Big Company Experience Only:** If a candidate's experience is limited *only* to large companies like Uber or Intel, they will be rejected unless it is paired with startup experience [10:05:00]. The belief is they "do not understand how it is to code in a startup organization" and would be "completely over their head" [08:03:00].
*   **Blacklisted Companies:** Candidates who have *ever* worked at specific companies, including Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell, are considered "scarlet-lettered" and "blacklisted" from ever being hired [10:56:00].

## Impact and Advice for Job Seekers
This extreme example illustrates how some companies establish "ridiculous wish lists" that are "not at all realistic" [12:25:00]. These hidden requirements can make job searching frustrating and lead to feelings of being "out of touch" with employer expectations [11:36:00]. Such demanding criteria often lead to positions remaining open for extended periods because a "qualified candidate" matching all specifications is impossible to find [13:30:00].

Job seekers are encouraged to recognize that if they encounter such situations, "it's them and not you" [12:49:00]. It's advisable to focus on presenting a clean, direct resume, engaging in targeted networking, and showcasing fit through platforms like GitHub or a portfolio [12:52:00]. Ultimately, job seekers should avoid "low-quality employers" with unrealistic expectations, as applying to such jobs only grants them more power [13:50:00]. Reclaiming control in one's career involves choosing not to subject oneself to these "ridiculous" rules [13:54:00].

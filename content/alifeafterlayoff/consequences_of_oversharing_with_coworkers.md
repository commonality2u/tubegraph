Oversharing personal or work-related details with coworkers can lead to significant professional repercussions, including credibility issues, stalled career progression, and damaged relationships. It is crucial to be selective about who you confide in and what information you share in a professional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## An Illustrative Lesson

The speaker recounts a personal experience early in their career as an HR professional working in a manufacturing and global engineering company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. During one rotation in a small town, they worked between two facilities and were responsible for staffing and employee relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

They befriended a line worker who was about their age, finding common ground and developing a good rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. One weekend, they accepted an invitation to meet the coworker and his friends at a local bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. During their conversation, which inevitably turned to work, the coworker asked about the new, inexperienced supervisor, Joe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The speaker made what they considered an innocent comment: "Yeah, Joe's doing well. He's relatively new to his role, so he's still growing, and I'm helping him with some things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The coworker nodded in agreement, and the conversation ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

However, the following week, the speaker's boss called them in, revealing that an "upset Joe" had reported them for "spreading rumors about him to the employees that he wasn't a good leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The line worker had gone directly to Joe's office first thing Monday morning, misrepresenting the conversation by stating, "Brian doesn't have any faith in you as a leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

The speaker was "dumbfounded" by the betrayal of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. They had to profusely apologize to Joe, explain what truly happened, and promise it would not occur again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This incident taught the speaker the hard way that one must be very careful with whom they choose to be friendly at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Key Consequences of Oversharing

### Credibility and Career Stunting
When you [[impact_of_oversharing_personal_information_in_interviews | overshare]], even seemingly innocent comments can find their way back to your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. If your boss hears through the grapevine that you are not to be trusted, it creates a major credibility issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This can stunt your long-term career potential, as having a reputation for being untrustworthy is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Association with Office Gossip
[[the_impact_of_office_gossip_on_career_progression | Office gossips]] are easily identifiable within any organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. They often congregate in areas like the lunchroom or water cooler, engaging in drama and talking about others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Risk of Crossing the Line:** Engaging in water cooler talk makes it easy to [[impact_of_oversharing_personal_information_in_interviews | overshare]] or say something you will regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Being Branded:** If you associate with office gossips, you risk being branded as one yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Leadership teams notice who belongs to which cliques, and being associated with gossips can hinder your upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Avoid Drama:** It's advisable to get your water, say hello, and leave to avoid getting sucked into workplace drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Negative Influences
Office gossips are often negative people who constantly complain about the boss, company, or pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Spending too much time with such individuals can inevitably bring you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Negative people can act as a "cancer" in a group, especially if you are focused on upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Compromised Professional Standing
Friendships with coworkers can become complicated, especially when promotions are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. If you are promoted over a coworker you were friendly with, the relationship can become competitive and awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability:** A coworker who knows your "dirty secrets" from water cooler conversations can compromise your position, especially if you are in a supervisory role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. An unscrupulous coworker might use shared information to hold you "hostage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Jealousy:** Jealousy from coworkers about your career progression can also hold you back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### [[dangers_of_mixing_social_events_with_coworkers | Dangers of Mixing Social Events with Coworkers]]
Partaking in social events outside of work hours, such as happy hours, with coworkers can be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Loose Lips:** Alcohol can lead to "loose lips," causing you to [[impact_of_oversharing_personal_information_in_interviews | overshare]] or say something off-color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Harassment:** There is a fine line between being chummy and harassment, which can include offensive jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Long-term Consequences:** As an old HR adage states, "Anything that you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Conclusion
While it is possible to make friends at work, it is essential to "pick and choose your friends very carefully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Always be cautious about your behavior, what you say, and what you share with coworkers to avoid making career-damaging mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

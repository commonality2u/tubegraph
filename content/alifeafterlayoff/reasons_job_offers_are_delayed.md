It's a common and frustrating scenario for job seekers: acing interviews, receiving positive feedback, and then experiencing an extended wait for a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This delay can sometimes stretch for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The reasons behind these delays are often rooted in the complex internal processes of talent acquisition and human resources departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### The Approval Process

One of the primary [[common_delays_in_recruitment | common delays in recruitment]] for a job offer is the extensive [[approval_process_for_job_offers | approval process for job offers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

After interviews, the recruiter holds a debrief meeting with all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Each interviewer provides a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" on moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, and near-unanimous consensus is often required to start the offer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The human resources or talent acquisition group then compiles offer details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, considering several factors:
*   **Candidate's Compensation Expectation** Notes from preliminary interviews are reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Market Wage Data** Local market wage surveys and industry pay rates are consulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Internal Salary Bands** Companies typically have salary bands with minimum, mid, and maximum ranges (or 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Most candidates are targeted at or below the 50th percentile to allow for future increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Offering at the top end of the range could mean no future raises, potentially leading to employee dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Internal Comparators** Salaries of other employees in similar roles within the organization are considered to ensure internal equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

If a candidate's salary expectation is significantly higher than the average for the role, the company must make strategic decisions on how to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The corporate recruiter's role includes advocating for the candidate to ensure the offer is compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. If the salary expectation stretches the current salary band, HR and the hiring manager may discuss "enriching" the role, meaning the company will expect more from the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It's advisable to target a role that properly aligns with your current experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Once an offer figure is determined, it typically goes through three or four layers of approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, including the hiring manager, their direct boss, and an HR business partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This entire process, even when smooth, can take at least a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Unavailability of Approvers
A significant cause of delay is when required approvers are unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. If managers are on vacation or tied up in business meetings, the offer process can be put on hold until they are available to provide approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Recruiters are often at the mercy of these individuals' schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Misalignment Between Managers
Sometimes, a senior manager may not be fully aligned with the hiring manager's vision for the role or the candidate profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The senior manager might step in at the last minute to re-scope or scrutinize the role, causing the offer process to halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While this doesn't necessarily mean the offer won't materialize, it introduces a significant delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Requirement for a Full Slate of Candidates
Even if a candidate has been pre-identified and fast-tracked through the interview process, someone in the approval chain might demand to see a full slate of candidates before an offer is extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This means the recruiting team must then spend several weeks sourcing and interviewing additional candidates, which significantly prolongs the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Recruiters typically push back on this, as candidate engagement usually wanes after two to three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Process Bloat
Some companies have cumbersome administrative or procedural steps that can slow down the offer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This "process bloat" can include slow software systems or additional checks and balances required for auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Slow Recruitment Team and Overloaded Personnel
Finally, delays can occur due to internal slowness within the recruitment team or among other involved parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This can include:
*   Recruiters not acting quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Hiring managers forgetting or delaying offer approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   Human resources teams not providing information promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   Overloaded recruiters and hiring managers who have other priorities and requisitions to fill, causing the current position to get buried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

While these delays are frustrating for candidates, they are also a source of frustration for recruiters who aim to fill positions efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. If you find yourself in this situation, it is advisable to check in with the recruiter every two or three days for an update on the offer timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

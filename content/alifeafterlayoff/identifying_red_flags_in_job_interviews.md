When seeking a job, it's crucial to recognize [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]] during the interview process, as suspicious questions from employers might indicate ulterior motives or a low-quality work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Employers often give "tells" that, if paid close attention to, can help discern if an opportunity is low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Listening for these [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]] can help job seekers decide whether to withdraw from consideration and avoid future headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Common Interview Questions Indicating Red Flags

Several specific questions from an interviewer can signal a potentially problematic employer or workplace culture:

### 1. Unplanned Absences
If an interviewer asks, "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, particularly for hourly employees, they are likely trying to determine if you will be an attendance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This question can indicate a company culture or management philosophy that is overly focused on attendance, likely due to past attendance problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It suggests a potentially inflexible workplace where calling off sick might lead to repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. If asked this, consider inquiring about their expectations regarding unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Strict responses may point to a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### 2. Minimum Acceptable Salary
A question like "What's your minimum acceptable salary?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> is essentially asking how cheaply they can hire you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This indicates a lack of flexibility in compensation and suggests the employer may consistently try to "nickel and dime" you, making it difficult to maintain a competitive salary or receive promotions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### 3. Commitment to Staying Two Years
If an interviewer asks, "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, it's a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] suggesting a high turnover issue within the company or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This question often arises from an employer's bias or a larger cultural problem, rather than a true indicator of your potential success in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### 4. Ever Been Fired
Being asked "If you've ever been fired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> is generally not relevant to your ability to perform the job at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Past performance, especially in a negative situation, is not always indicative of future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. It's advisable to redirect this question to focus on your accomplishments and future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If the interviewer continues to probe or expresses disapproval, it might be best to withdraw your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### 5. Accusations of Resume Embellishment
If an interviewer accuses you of "exaggerating or embellishing any part of your resume" (assuming you haven't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, it's a major [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This indicates a fundamental lack of trust from the outset, or an assumption that all candidates are dishonest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Such an accusation is a strong sign of a toxic employer and a problematic company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### 6. Biggest Failure
The question "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> can be a trap question designed to use your answer against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While the intent might be to understand how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. An employer focusing on failures might develop a bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. If you must answer, focus on how you overcame the adversity rather than dwelling on the failure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### 7. Availability for Off-Shifts or Weekends
When interviewing for a specific shift, if asked about "your availability on off shifts or over weekends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, it suggests you may be expected to work involuntary overtime, indicating a poor work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. It's important to clarify expectations regarding true work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 8. On-site Availability for Remote Jobs
Similarly, for remote jobs, if asked about "your availability to come on site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, it indicates that the position is not truly remote, but rather a hybrid role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. If a "fully remote" job is pitched as such but is actually hybrid, there's a high likelihood it could eventually become 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This is a significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] for those seeking genuinely remote positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### 9. Dealing with Rude Co-workers or Managers
A question like "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> immediately raises concerns about the workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. If the manager themselves is rude, it's a definite [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Such questions can indicate a problematic cultural issue within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Lack of Opportunity to Ask Questions

Beyond specific questions, a major [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] is when the interviewer dominates the entire conversation and does not "give you an opportunity to ask questions of your own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. An interview is a two-way street where the candidate should also be assessing the company and interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. If an employer takes offense to a candidate asking questions professionally, it suggests they believe they are above assessment and might not be a desirable company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

One or two of these questions alone may not definitively mean a company is poor quality, but they serve as important data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. When encountering these [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]], make sure to ask good probing questions to understand the underlying cultural issues before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

When seeking employment, job seekers may encounter [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flags]] during the interview process that indicate a low-quality employer or a potentially challenging work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Recognizing these "tells" can help candidates decide whether to pursue an opportunity or walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Common Red Flag Questions and Scenarios

Interviewers often give hints through specific questions or their overall approach that can signal underlying issues within the company culture or management style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
This question, while seemingly innocent, often indicates that the employer is trying to assess if you will be an attendance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. A deeper concern is that it reveals a company culture or management philosophy that is overly focused on attendance issues, likely due to past problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This suggests a potentially inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. If asked, consider redirecting the question to understand their expectations around unplanned absences. If they indicate a strict crackdown, it may point to a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
This question suggests the employer is attempting to determine the lowest possible cost to secure you, indicating a lack of flexibility in compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This can be a strong indicator that you will likely struggle to maintain a competitive salary, receive raises, or secure promotions in the future, as the company may always seek to "nickel and dime" employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
This question can signal a turnover issue within the company or specific department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It prompts concerns about why people are leaving quickly enough for the employer to feel the need to assess this in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Such a question often has little to do with a candidate's potential success and may indicate a larger cultural problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### "Have you ever been fired?"
While a sensitive topic, this question is generally considered an invasion of privacy and not directly relevant to your ability to perform the job at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Past employment decisions may not accurately predict future performance, as a termination could have been due to a poor situation rather than a reflection on the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If asked, it's advised to redirect the conversation to focus on future accomplishments and current job capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Persistent probing after redirection may be a reason to withdraw candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Accusing you of exaggerating or embellishing your resume
Assuming the candidate has been truthful, an accusation of exaggeration or embellishment suggests an employer who already lacks trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This implies either a belief that you are lying or a general assumption that all candidates are untrustworthy. This behavior points to a toxic employer and a potentially suspicious and difficult work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
This is often considered a "trap question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While the intent might be to gauge how you overcome adversity, focusing on failures can lead to bias against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The interviewer should ideally focus on successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. If answering, it's best to minimize time on the failure itself and highlight how you overcame it positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Asking for availability on off-shifts or weekends (especially for primary shift roles)
This question, common in hourly roles but also seen for salaried positions, suggests that working overtime against your will is likely, indicating a potential work-life imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. It's crucial to push back and get clear expectations for true work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Asking about availability to come on-site for a remote job
If a position is advertised as remote, but the interviewer asks about your availability to come into the office regularly, it's likely a hybrid position, not truly remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If they misrepresent a hybrid role as fully remote, there's a high chance it could eventually transition to 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is a significant [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] for those seeking genuinely remote positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
This question strongly implies that you will be working with rude individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. If the rudeness extends to management, it's a major [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This question directly indicates a cultural issue within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Lack of opportunity for the candidate to ask questions
If an interviewer dominates the conversation and does not allow you to ask questions at the end, it's a significant [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. An interview should be a two-way street, where you assess the company and interviewer as much as they assess you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. If they take offense to you asking questions professionally, it indicates they believe they are "above" being assessed, which is a strong indicator of a negative company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

Encountering one or two of these [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] questions doesn't automatically mean a company is poor quality, but they serve as crucial data points to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. It is important to ask probing questions to gain a clearer understanding of the situation before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

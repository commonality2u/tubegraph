When interviewing for a new position, it's crucial to present yourself as a committed and passionate candidate, specifically for the role and career path you are pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. While employers often ask about [[career_planning_and_goalsetting_for_longterm_success | career plans]] and where you see yourself in five years, oversharing or revealing certain intentions can negatively impact your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Why Interviewers Ask About Career Plans

Interviewers ask about your [[importance_of_career_planning | career plans]] to gauge your commitment to the specific career path, your long-term interest in the field, and your potential for growth and promotion within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. They want to understand your aspirations and ensure they align with the company's needs and the trajectory of the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## What to Avoid Revealing

### Plans to Start a Business or Change Careers
One common mistake is revealing plans to start a business or make a significant career shift in the near future, such as within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. While having entrepreneurial ambitions or considering a future career change is understandable, disclosing these plans during an interview for a different job type can be a "deal breaker" for many employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

It signals that you may lack passion for the work you are interviewing for, suggesting you view the current role as a temporary stepping stone rather than a dedicated [[career_management_strategies | career management strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The goal is to convey a level of passion for the position at hand to make a positive impression on the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Limited Time Left in the Workforce
Similarly, avoid indicating how many years you have left in the workforce, especially if you are nearing retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Statements like "I just want to land this last job... put in 10 good years and ride off into the sunset" can create a bias against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. If a hiring manager envisions a candidate who will grow with the role for 10+ years, and you imply a shorter tenure, it can lead to a rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Even though average job tenure is shorter, employers still make decisions based on long-term potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Desperation to Find Work
While not directly about career plans, revealing desperation for a job—due to layoff, firing, or financial urgency—can also undermine your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This implies a lack of discerning [[the_importance_of_career_planning_and_assessing_job_opportunities | job opportunity assessment]] and can push employers away, similar to a "desperate" dynamic in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Even in difficult circumstances, it's important to convey composure and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Strategic Communication

When asked about your [[effective_job_search_strategies_and_career_planning | career planning]] and goals, frame your answers to show genuine interest and alignment with the position and company you are interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Focus on how this role fits into your professional growth within that specific field or industry, emphasizing your commitment to the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

When preparing for an [[job_interview_strategies_and_tips | job interview]], it is crucial to learn the concept of storytelling, as hiring managers favor candidates who can tell effective stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. In an interview, you are essentially a storyteller, and your ability to tell compelling stories increases your likelihood of impressing the interviewer and securing a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The STAR Methodology

A highly recommended method for answering [[strategies_for_answering_difficult_interview_questions | interview questions]] is the tried-and-true [[star_methodology_for_interviews | STAR methodology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This framework helps structure your responses in a clear and impactful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

STAR stands for:
*   **S** - Situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **T** - Task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   **A** - Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   **R** - Result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>

### Breaking Down STAR

*   **Situation (S):** This is the introduction of your "hero" into the story. Provide the listener with context about why you were in that specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Task (T):** Explain what the "hero" (you) was going to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Action (A):** Describe the specific actions you took to accomplish the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Result (R):** Detail the "happily ever after" – what was the outcome of your actions? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

> [!tip]
> Keep the [[star_methodology_for_interviews | STAR methodology]] in mind when preparing your interview answers, as it is a proven and effective method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Applying Storytelling to Common Interview Questions

Preparing answers to commonly asked questions using a storytelling approach can significantly [[improving_job_interview_performance | improve your job interview performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### "Tell me about yourself"

This question is almost guaranteed to be asked in nearly every interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The interviewer wants context for your presence in the room, understanding that your resume already shows a base level of competency for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategic Approach
> Use this as an opportunity to add "flavor or color commentary" to your background, explaining why you are the best possible fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Focus on aspects relevant to the job, avoiding non-related hobbies, family details, or travel stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Your narrative should have a clear endpoint, directly supporting your suitability for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

*   **Example (Engineering Role):** "I've always had an interest in how things work, dating back to when I was a kid. In fact, I helped my dad rebuild a 1969 Chevelle, which sparked my interest in mechanical engineering. So, I made a decision to study that in school. Early in my career, I gravitated toward heavy manufacturing and solving complex problems. Big machines and impossible problems excite me. One particularly enjoyable challenge is when I had to restore an idle production line with a $300,000 capital improvement project. I led this install, and I'd be happy to share more details on how I completed this project under budget and two weeks ahead of schedule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### "Why do you want to work here?" or "Why should we hire you?"

Interviewers want to know your genuine interest in the company or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategic Approach
> Be honest; it's easier to convey sincere motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Ensure your answer relates to the job and highlights something unique about the company that differentiates you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Show genuine excitement about the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

*   **Example (YouTube Role):** "Obviously, YouTube is well known as an innovator in the social media space, and I'm an avid consumer of the service. In addition, I've been following along the YouTube corporate page, and it seems like your teams are really engaged, passionate, and seem to have a lot of fun. And in my most recent job, I had a chance to impact several major mobile application projects, but at a little bit of a smaller scope. So the next logical step for me is to apply these same skills but on more of an enterprise-wide scale, and I feel like this role provides an outstanding challenge for me to do so, and I think that's why I'm so intrigued about this opportunity at YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### "What's your greatest weakness?"

This question can be tricky, as you don't want to give generic or overly prepared answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Avoid clichés like "I'm too detail-oriented" or "I care too much," as hiring managers see through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategic Approach
> Be honest about a real weakness that won't negatively impact your suitability for *this specific job* (e.g., don't admit to being bad with numbers for an accounting role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Discuss the impact of that weakness on your work and share a concrete example of how you learned from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### "What's your greatest strength?"

This is the flip side of the weakness question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategic Approach
> Pull from the job posting to ensure your strength is work-related and relevant to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Focus on a strength that is most important for success in that particular job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Be honest and provide a great example using the [[star_methodology_for_interviews | STAR format]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### "What's your greatest professional accomplishment?"

Companies typically seek to hire high achievers, especially in the type of work they are recruiting for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategic Approach
> Strategically think from the hiring manager's perspective: what is your biggest accomplishment directly related to the job you're applying for? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> Provide a [[star_methodology_for_interviews | STAR-formatted example]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

*   **Example (Product Manager):** "My greatest professional accomplishment was a key contributor to a major product launch at my last company. In my role as a product manager, I was tasked with bringing to market a high-profile software platform. And in particular, I was responsible for ensuring that the product teams were aligned. I coordinated tight deadlines of deliverables among six global development teams, and then I removed roadblocks to ensure that all of our goals were met. And a particularly challenging issue came up at the 11th hour where the dev team actually made a code-breaking error that was about to go out the door, but I ended up catching it at the last minute. We were able to troubleshoot it, and I was able to get the relevant team to correct the issue before we went live. The product was launched with great success, and as a result, I was actually formally recognized with a promotion. And to this day, that's my biggest professional accomplishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## General Preparation for Interview Storytelling

When preparing for an interview, allocate time to develop and refine your answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

> [!tip] Refine Your Stories
> Write down your answers to ensure you're comfortable with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. However, avoid rehearsing them so closely that you sound robotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The goal is to internalize your stories to the point where you can recite them seamlessly and effortlessly, making them sound like normal conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

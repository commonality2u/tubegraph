Constructive dismissal, also known as [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | quiet firing]], is an HR concept where a company makes an employee's work or employment situation so unbearable that they feel they have no other option but to quit voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This tactic is used when a company has "ill intentions" about an employee's continued employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Reasons for Constructive Dismissal

Companies might consider constructive dismissal for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>:
*   **Avoiding issues** If an employee is deemed a potential problem, terminating them directly might cause additional issues for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Avoiding benefit payouts** Companies may try to avoid paying out certain benefits, particularly unemployment insurance. If an employee leaves voluntarily, the company is not obligated to pay these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | Signs of Quiet Firing]]

It's important to pay attention and trust your gut if you notice one or more of these signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>:

### Financial and Career Stagnation
*   **No raises** Not receiving a raise for several years, especially when other colleagues in the department or company have received them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is a strong indicator that the company has cut you off from future raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Passed over for promotion** Repeatedly being overlooked for promotions, even after positioning yourself as the best candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. When a company promotes someone else, there's often a discussion behind the scenes about the potential fallout and the need for damage control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Being continually blocked from advancement suggests it's time to update your resume and explore other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Uncomfortable Work Conditions
*   **Denied PTO/Vacation requests** Repeated denial of PTO or vacation requests, assuming they are reasonable, not abusive, and covered by colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This indicates the employer may not value you and is trying to make your life uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** Being placed on a PIP or similar performance management tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. While not always a guaranteed exit, if the PIP terms are unreasonable or not based in reality, it's a strong sign the company is managing you out or subtly encouraging voluntary removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Manipulated schedule or workload**
    *   **Mandatory overtime** Suddenly being assigned mandatory overtime, especially during times the boss knows are inconvenient or burdensome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Reduced hours** Having your hours cut to the bare minimum required for employment, which could affect benefits eligibility and pay, especially for hourly workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   **Excessive workload** Having an unbearable amount of work dumped on you with no additional pay, forcing you to work undesirable hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Unscrupulous companies might use this to motivate employees to look for new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Lackluster performance appraisals** Receiving suddenly poor performance appraisals, particularly if previous ones were positive, and your boss becomes overly critical about aspects they were once complimentary about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. HR departments use these as part of formal documentation for performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Criticism can be very demotivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Communication and Exclusion
*   **Boss disengaging** Your boss no longer communicates with you, frequently rescheduling or canceling one-on-one meetings, not prioritizing you, or failing to respond to emails in a timely manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. They may always seem busy or inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Removal from key work/meetings** Being suddenly removed from projects you were leading, no longer invited to staff meetings you previously attended, or excluded from "water cooler talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. You might even feel shunned in public by your boss and other colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Employee Options

If you suspect your company is constructively discharging you or preparing to, you have several options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>:

1.  **Force their hand** Continue with the status quo and let the company terminate you if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
2.  **Seek new employment** Proactively quit your job and find a more supportive workplace. Remaining in a toxic environment is detrimental to your personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
3.  **Consult an attorney** If you believe you are being discriminated against, seek legal counsel from a local attorney to interpret applicable laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Regardless of your choice, it is always best practice to have your resume up-to-date and ready, to avoid scrambling when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

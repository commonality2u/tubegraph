Constructive dismissal is a concept in Human Resources (HR) where a company makes an employee's work or employment situation so unbearable that they feel they have no other option but to resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This differs from direct termination as the company aims for the employee to quit voluntarily.

## Reasons for Constructive Dismissal

Companies might consider constructive dismissal for various reasons:
*   **Avoidance of Issues** They may deem an employee a potential problem and fear that direct termination could cause additional issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Benefit Avoidance** Companies may try to avoid paying out certain benefits, particularly unemployment insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. If an employee leaves voluntarily, the company is not responsible for these payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Signs of Quiet Firing (Constructive Dismissal)

An employee might experience an uneasy feeling that their days are numbered if the company has ill intentions regarding their employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These signs indicate that a company might be attempting to "quiet fire" an employee, pushing them out subtly:

*   **Lack of Raises** Not receiving a raise in several years, especially when other colleagues in the department or company have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This is a clear red flag if the company has cut off an employee from future raises while others receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Passed Over for Promotion** Being repeatedly passed up for promotion, even after making interest known and positioning oneself as a strong candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This suggests that the company has decided not to promote the employee, often involving behind-the-scenes discussions about potential fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Denied PTO/Vacation Requests** Repeated denial of paid time off (PTO) or vacation requests, assuming the requests are not abusive, are for reasonable time, and are coordinated with colleagues for coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This indicates that the employer may not value the employee and wants to make their life uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Placement on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** Being placed on a PIP or other performance management tool often signifies that the company is trying to manage the employee out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If the PIP's requirements seem unreasonable and not based in reality, it's a strong indicator that the company aims to encourage voluntary departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Schedule Manipulation** Sudden changes to work schedules, such as a surge in mandatory overtime (especially when the boss knows it would be a burden) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, or conversely, hours being cut to the bare minimum, potentially affecting benefits eligibility and paychecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This can gently encourage an employee to seek new employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Increased Workload** Dumping an unbearable amount of work on an employee, forcing them to work unwanted hours without additional pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This is designed to motivate a reasonable person to find another job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Negative Performance Appraisals** Performance appraisals suddenly becoming lackluster, especially after a history of good reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The boss may become overly critical about aspects that were previously complimented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. HR departments use these appraisals for formal documentation, particularly if an employee is deemed a "performance issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Boss Disengagement** A boss no longer communicating, rescheduling one-on-one meetings, not making the employee a priority, or being unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This includes not responding to emails, providing needed information, or helping clear roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Exclusion from Work/Meetings** Being suddenly removed from projects, especially those previously led by the employee, or not being invited to staff meetings they previously attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This also includes being excluded from casual "water cooler talk" or being shunned in public by the boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

While noticing one or two of these signs doesn't automatically mean an employee is being "quiet fired," it's crucial to pay attention and trust your gut feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Employee Options

If an employee suspects they are being constructively dismissed or the company is preparing for it, they have several options:

1.  **Force the Company's Hand** Continue the status quo and let the company terminate them if that's their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
2.  **Seek New Employment** Act as a "free agent" by quitting the current job and finding a better, more supportive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Staying in a toxic environment is detrimental to personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
3.  **Consult an Attorney** If the employee feels they are being discriminated against, they should find a local attorney to interpret local laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

It is always best practice to have an up-to-date resume ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

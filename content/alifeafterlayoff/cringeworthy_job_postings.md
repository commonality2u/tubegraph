This article compiles several examples of [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | cringeworthy job postings]] and employer behaviors found online, serving as a guide to [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | identify red flags]] and spot [[toxic_workplace_signs_in_job_postings | poor quality employers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The goal is to help job seekers focus on the best opportunities and avoid those that are less desirable or even predatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Case Study 1: Racetrack Gas Station – Public Shaming
A sign taped to the front door of a Racetrack gas station read: "We are closed due to Alex walking out. We apologize about the inconvenience – Racetrack Team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Toxic Workplace Sign
> This behavior by the leadership team of publicly shaming an employee who walked out indicates a potentially [[toxic_workplace_signs_in_job_postings | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It suggests issues with pay, treatment, or management, making it a bad look for customers and prospective employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Case Study 2: Educational Establishment – Absurd Pay Scale
A note from an educational establishment detailed a new pay scale for instructional aides, including a "loyalty component" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Unrealistic Employer Demands & Compensation Red Flags
> This pay structure reveals [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | unrealistic employer demands]] and extremely low compensation.
> *   Starting pay is $12/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
> *   A 50-cent raise is given only after five years of work, which does not keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
> *   Working 30 years would only result in a $3/hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
> *   A higher rate for master's degrees may be considered only "at the discretion of superintendent," with potentially only a 50-cent bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
> This approach suggests an inability to retain staff long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Case Study 3: Salty Llama – Unpaid Equity Position
Salty Llama, a startup, sought a Shopify Web Development Manager for seven hours a week in exchange for equity, specifically up to 0.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. They explicitly stated they were "unable to pay any salary or freelancer fee at this time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Fake Job Postings & Compensation Red Flags
> This is a prime example of a [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | fake job posting]] or a highly undesirable one.
> *   **Unpaid Work**: Expecting professional work in exchange for speculative equity, especially for a small number of hours, is a major [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
> *   **Low Equity Value**: The chances of such equity translating into a significant financial gain (liquidity event) are almost nil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
> *   **Empty Promises**: The dangling carrot of a "generous salary" and "full-time position" upon company growth is often an empty promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
> Job seekers should avoid such positions and demand to be paid for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Case Study 4: Canonical – Bizarre Hiring Process
Canonical, a software company, displayed multiple [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] in its hiring practices for a "Talent Selection Lead" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Geographic Spamming
Canonical posted the same position across a wide geographic area (e.g., San Diego, Charlotte) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Red Flag: High Openings, Low Flow
> When a company spams the same position over many locations, it often means they struggle with candidate flow or cannot fill the opening, indicating potential underlying issues with the company or the role itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Template Error in Job Description
The job posting itself was a template, displaying placeholders like "job summary" and "five to ten bullet points key responsibilities" instead of actual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Identifying Low Quality Job Postings
> This error, remaining live for days, suggests a lack of attention to detail and professionalism in their hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This is a clear indicator of a [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | low quality job posting]].

### Ridiculous Interview Process
For a Senior Linux Support Engineer role, Canonical initiated a convoluted, multi-stage interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>:
1.  **Initial Application Review** (completed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
2.  **Written Interview**: An unconventional stage requiring significant time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
3.  **Standardized Personality and Aptitude Tests**: Multiple tests follow the written interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
4.  **Introductory Interview**: Only reached after the prior stages, potentially wasting hours of a candidate's time without a guarantee of speaking to a hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
5.  **Technical Take-Home Test and Technical Interview**: Separate, intensive technical assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
6.  **Leadership Interviews**: The final stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Absurd Job Requirements and Red Flags
> This process is described as "rigorous" but is effectively "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. It exhibits many [[absurd_job_requirements_and_red_flags | red flags]] in an interview process:
> *   **Excessive Stages**: Too many hoops to jump through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
> *   **Time-Consuming Pre-Interview Tasks**: Requiring hours of unpaid work (written interviews, tests) before even an introductory interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
> *   **Candidate Screening Themselves Out**: The recruiter uses the written interview as a "lazy way" for candidates to screen themselves out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

### Absurd Interview Questions
The written interview section for a senior role included questions about high school interests, university achievements, and rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Unrealistic Employer Demands
> Asking experienced professionals to recall minute details from their high school or university days is highly [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | unrealistic]] and unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This extensive, irrelevant questioning for a senior position is bizarre and suggests a flawed hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Case Study 5: Turf Envy – Unpaid "Superhero" Internship
Turf Envy, a small company, advertised an unpaid "Human Resources Specialist" virtual internship on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. The job description used overly enthusiastic and cringeworthy language, such as "never been a better time to invest in your future by working for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, and claiming "we are all superheroes here" who "have fun" at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>, even comparing themselves to the Avengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Fake Job Postings & Employer Strategies Behind Fake Job Listings
> This is another instance of a [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | fake job posting]] or highly exploitative opportunity.
> *   **Unpaid Professional Role**: Expecting specialized work for free is a major red flag and potentially illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
> *   **Cringeworthy Language**: Over-the-top, childish descriptions ("superheroes," "zany team") often mask a poor work environment or an unwillingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.
> *   **Exploitation of Desperation**: These types of listings prey on individuals desperate for experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
> Job seekers should maintain self-respect and seek paid opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## Bonus Cringeworthy Moment: Recruiter Who Enjoys Rejecting Candidates
A social media post by a recruiter stated, "as a recruiter I get the most joy out of rejecting candidates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>, claiming offering a job is "relatively easy" in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Toxic Workplace Signs & Red Flags in Hiring Practices
> This mentality is described as "narcissistic" and "psychopathic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
> *   **Lack of Empathy**: A recruiter who enjoys rejecting candidates lacks the empathy necessary for the role and reflects poorly on the companies they represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
> *   **Professionalism**: Professional recruiters aim to place the right people in the right roles and find joy in making offers, not in delivering rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
> Encountering such an individual is a major [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] for any company they work for.

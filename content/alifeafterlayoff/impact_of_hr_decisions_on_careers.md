Human Resources (HR) is often perceived by employees as an advocate or a supportive friend within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, the speaker, with 20 years of experience in HR management and recruiting for both large and small companies, aims to dispel this myth and provide a broader, undisclosed truth about the HR function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The True Function of Human Resources

At its core, HR is a business department, not primarily designed to be a department for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The speaker dislikes the term "human resources" because it doesn't fully capture its fundamental purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The functions of HR can be understood in a hierarchy of purposes:

### Primary Purpose: Risk Mitigation and Compliance
The ultimate driving mission of all HR departments is to mitigate risk, implement risk avoidance, and ensure compliance with legal requirements, thereby keeping the company out of legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. When an employee reports something to HR, the department is legally required to act on it if it indicates potential risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### Secondary Purpose: Strategic Business Alignment
HR acts as a [[hr_as_a_strategic_business_partner | strategic business partner]] to senior leadership, sitting on executive councils and engaging in closed-door meetings with presidents, CEOs, and executive teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Its purpose is to align the talent within the organization with the overall business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

This strategic alignment is where adverse employment decisions, such as [[impact_of_layoffs_on_career_momentum | layoffs]], often occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. If an employee's position or contributions do not align with the company's future strategic direction, they may be let go, even if they are not a "bad" employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. At this level, employees are often seen as data points or numbers on a spreadsheet, and decisions are purely business-oriented, not personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Tertiary Purpose: Talent Management
This is the function most employees are familiar with, involving attracting, developing, and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This includes:
*   Recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Establishing business practices and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
*   Hiring and developing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>
*   Benefits administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>
*   Service-oriented functions, such as resolving paycheck or benefits issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

It is at these lower, more localized levels that HR professionals are most likely to be genuinely compassionate and interested in helping employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Employee Experience and Career Ownership

Many individuals harbor bitterness and frustration towards HR, often stemming from adverse employment decisions they have experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. While some HR professionals may indeed be "cold" or "calculated," employees are encouraged to take ownership of their situations and reflect on their own contributions to the circumstances that led to their frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Instead of lashing out or blaming others, understanding one's role in the situation allows for learning and positioning oneself differently in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This process of self-reflection helps heal "wounds" and prevents carrying jadedness into future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Strategic Engagement with HR
Employees should be cautious about when and how they engage with HR, especially concerning sensitive issues:
*   **When to involve HR**: It is crucial to approach HR for legal issues, such as harassment or illegal activities, to protect oneself and prevent further issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **When to be cautious**: For performance-related issues, conflicts with a [[impact_of_a_bad_boss_on_career_progression | boss]], or general complaints, employees should try to resolve them at their own level first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Venting to HR about non-legal issues is not recommended, as they are primarily listening for corporate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### Becoming a "Free Agent"
To gain control over one's career and minimize the [[impact_of_company_financial_health_on_job_decisions | impact of company decisions]], individuals should embrace the mindset of a "free agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This means:
*   **Taking ownership**: Be in control of your career path, rather than being at the mercy of an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Proactive preparation**: Continuously develop skills and stay at the top of your game, like an athlete who hits the weight room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Avoiding complacency**: Do not blindly trust a company to always act in your best interest, as they will prioritize business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

This approach ensures that even if an adverse employment decision occurs, its [[impact_of_layoffs_on_career_momentum | impact]] is less severe because the individual has already mapped their career direction and is prepared for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

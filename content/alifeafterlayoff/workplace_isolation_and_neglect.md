A tragic incident at a Wells Fargo office in Tempe, Arizona, highlights the severe consequences of [[workplace_burnout_and_its_effects | workplace isolation]] and neglect. In August, 60-year-old Denise Prudhomme was found dead at her desk, four days after she had clocked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Discovery

Denise Prudhomme entered the Wells Fargo corporate office building on August 16th, a Friday, at 7:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Four days later, on August 20th, building security called officials after a subject was reported down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. An anonymous employee stated that a colleague found Prudhomme deceased in her cubicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead at 4:55, indicating she had likely been deceased for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Her cubicle was located on the third floor, away from the main aisle, suggesting she was in a less visible area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Multiple employees had reportedly complained of a foul odor, but it was dismissed as a plumbing issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means Prudhomme was left unnoticed and decomposing for four full days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, encompassing a full weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## A Culture of Neglect

The incident has raised serious questions about the [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | corporate culture]] at Wells Fargo and the broader issue of [[understanding_and_identifying_toxic_workplaces | workplace isolation]].

> "It's really heartbreaking and I'm thinking what if I was just sitting there would nobody would check on me... To hear that she's been sitting at a desk like that would make me feel sick and nobody did anything that's how she spent her final can you imagine spending your final moments in an office building and dying at your desk that's your last few moments on Earth is filling out a TPS report that literally nobody took notice of and apparently nobody cared this woman was completely forgotten..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

The lack of awareness from colleagues and management is particularly striking. No one seemed to notice Prudhomme's absence from meetings or her failure to submit reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The situation highlights a profound level of [[workplace_burnout_and_its_effects | invisibility]] some employees experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Wells Fargo issued a statement expressing deep sadness and offering condolences, noting that counselors were available and they were cooperating with the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Police indicated no foul play, suggesting a health event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Irony of Return-to-Office Mandates

The incident is seen as particularly ironic given the finance industry's push for employees to return to the office for "corporate office culture" and "collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. In this case, there was clearly no collaboration, as Prudhomme was literally "rotting away on the third floor by herself in a cube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This raises questions about accountability for management who failed to notice her prolonged absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

The speaker notes that Prudhomme's work couldn't have been "all that valuable" if her absence went unnoticed for so long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

This tragic event serves as a stark reminder for both employees and employers:

*   **Seek Value:** If you feel underappreciated or invisible in your current workplace, find a place that values you and notices your presence and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Health:** It's crucial to prioritize your health and wellness above work. Take sick days and vacations without guilt, as you never know when your last day will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control:** Understand that in many large corporate environments, employees can be seen as "just a cog in a wheel" or "a number on a spreadsheet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It's essential to act as the CEO of your own career, as "clearly nobody else is looking out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

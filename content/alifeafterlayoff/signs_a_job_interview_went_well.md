When interviewing for a job, it's common to wonder if things went well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. As a corporate recruiter, the following subtle signs can indicate that the team liked you and an offer might be imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Positive Indicators

### 1. The Recruiter Keeps You "Warm"
After a successful interview, the hiring manager may ask the recruiter to "keep the candidate warm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This means they want to keep you engaged and excited about the role while they wrap up other interviews, handle loose ends, or wait for other decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. If the company, particularly the recruiter, keeps you updated step-by-step on the behind-the-scenes process, it's generally a very good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

On the flip side, if the recruiter doesn't keep you updated, with long periods of no information, it's probably not a great sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This often indicates they are working through other candidate slates, and you may not be considered a top candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### 2. They Ask About Other Interviews/Offers
If the interviewer or recruiter asks if you are actively interviewing with other companies, it's a strong indicator of their interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This question is not sinister; recruiters ask to gauge how aggressively they need to move you through the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. A good candidate typically won't last long if the process is slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If you have another interview or offer, it signals to the recruiter that they need to expedite the process, potentially skipping steps or interviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### 3. Immediate Scheduling of the Next Interview
A very strong sign is if, upon concluding your interview, they immediately try to schedule the next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This could happen right on the call or the recruiter might call you the same day to move you to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This indicates that they are fast-tracking you, clearly identifying you as a strong candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. If they are making efforts to get you an interview with a senior leader, it's an extremely strong sign you are a very solid candidate and likely to receive an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Conversely, if they repeatedly give you the runaround, struggle to align schedules, or constantly postpone the next step, it might indicate that the job is not a high priority or that you are considered a mid-tier candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:05:07]</a>.

### 4. Reconfirming Interest and Salary Expectations
If a recruiter calls you back after interviews are concluded to reconfirm your interest and salary expectations, it's a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This usually means the hiring manager wants them to gauge your current situation and interest in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Reconfirming salary expectations is a strong indication that they are working through numbers to present an offer they expect you to be excited about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. It's important to be realistic and consistent with your previously stated salary expectations to avoid a potential [[Red flags in job interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### 5. The Hiring Manager Calls You Directly
If the hiring manager calls you directly instead of the recruiter, it's a significant positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Recruiters often suggest this to hiring managers if they really like a candidate, to reconfirm interest, answer lingering questions, and address any potential objections to the job early in the offer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This "pre-sale" or "pre-close" strategy aims to get you excited and ready to accept the offer quickly, minimizing lengthy negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Overall
Being invited to an interview, especially a panel interview, means they already like you and believe you are a good fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The interview is your opportunity to shine and demonstrate why you're a great fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. These signs can help alleviate some anxiety during the stressful interviewing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

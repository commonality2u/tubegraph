Maintaining privacy is crucial when engaged in an [[effective_job_search_strategies | active job search]], especially when currently employed. Disclosing your job search to coworkers can have unintended and potentially negative consequences for your current employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Avoiding Disclosure to Coworkers

When you begin discussing your [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search]] within the workplace, information tends to spread rapidly through whispers and water cooler conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Before long, the entire department may become aware that you are looking for new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

This information will inevitably reach individuals you would prefer not to know, such as your boss, other senior leaders, and potentially the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. If your employer learns of your [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search]], it could accelerate your departure from the company, even if you are not ready to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Protecting Your Resume and Online Profile

Beyond verbal disclosures, exercise extreme caution regarding where you place your resume if you do not want your current employer to know about your [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Consider the following:
*   Avoid uploading a resume that lists your current company or job to public [[data_privacy_concerns_during_the_job_application_process | resume databases]] like Indeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Refrain from uploading your resume to your current [[data_privacy_concerns_during_the_job_application_process | LinkedIn]] profile and setting yourself as "available to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Taking these precautions helps ensure that your search remains confidential and does not prematurely impact your current employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

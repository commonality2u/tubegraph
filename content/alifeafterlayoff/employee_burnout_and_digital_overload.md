The "Great Resignation" is a phenomenon where people are voluntarily leaving their jobs en masse, influenced by global events over an 18-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This trend is a legitimate phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Microsoft research indicated that up to 41% of currently working individuals planned to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In April 2021, a record four million people voluntarily quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Labor Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Reasons for the Great Resignation

### Re-evaluation of Work-Life Balance
During lockdowns, many began to see their lives differently, realizing how much time was spent [[impact_of_commuting_and_long_work_hours_on_mental_health | commuting]] and in an office setting that might not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Pre-pandemic, [[impact_of_remote_work_on_employee_satisfaction | remote work]] often carried a stigma, with assumptions that remote employees were less dedicated or worked less hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, many working remotely, especially in blended or hybrid roles, often work more hours than in an office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The shift to [[impact_of_remote_work_on_employee_satisfaction | remote work]] for many was an easy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Companies were unexpectedly forced into remote models in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This revealed that many positions, particularly white-collar, professional-level jobs, can be done effectively remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The sudden closure of schools and the need for homeschooling also forced a recalibration of work models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Resistance to Remote Work and Impact on Employees
Despite the success of remote work, some CEOs and leadership teams, like those in financial services (e.g., J.P. Morgan), are insisting on employees returning to the office, often without a valid business reason beyond "facetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Additionally, some companies proposed adjusting salaries based on an employee's geographic location if they moved while working remotely, which can seem punitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Increased Workload and Digital Overload
In 2020-2021, many companies overcorrected with layoffs, anticipating a greater impact on their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. When the market recovered faster than expected, remaining employees took on a significantly increased workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This, combined with the blend of work from home and constant digital communication (Teams, Zoom calls), led to people getting [[signs_of_burnout_in_the_workplace | burned out]] from [[signs_of_burnout_in_the_workplace | digital overloading]] and exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

This [[signs_of_burnout_in_the_workplace | digital overloading]] and lack of connection contribute to employees having "had enough" and voluntarily leaving their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Many people, even those gainfully employed in good jobs, are experiencing [[career_dissatisfaction_and_burnout | career dissatisfaction and burnout]] and are looking to make changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Impact on Companies and the Future of Work
Companies that remain rigid in their philosophy regarding return-to-work, remote work, and flexibility are expected to struggle competitively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Remote work and [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | work-life balance]] are no longer competitive advantages but are becoming standard expectations; not offering them will put companies at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Recruiters are observing that [[impact_of_remote_work_on_employee_satisfaction | remote work]] and [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | work-life balance]] are much bigger concerns for candidates than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

Moving forward, companies will need to adapt their approach to the "employment experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This means offering flexibility, competitive salaries and benefits, clear [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | career paths]], and a focus on [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | work-life balance]], as employees are no longer willing to work 60-70 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The "post-pandemic era" is defined by how organizations shape the way people work and live, from productivity and flexibility to well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Failing to offer these aspects will leave companies behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

This period has led to a redefinition of priorities for individuals in the workforce, which is expected to force companies to adapt, ultimately for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

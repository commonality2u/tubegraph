Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has issued a memo declaring the end of remote work for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This move follows similar announcements from other major tech companies like Google and Dell, who also demand their employees return to the office, asserting that the remote workplace no longer suits their business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Amazon's decision is expected to influence other companies to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Amazon's Stated Culture and Values

Andy Jassy's memo outlines changes intended to further strengthen Amazon's [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | culture]] and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Jassy attributes his 27-year tenure at Amazon largely to its [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He highlights key aspects of this [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | culture]]:
*   Customer focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Collaboration and invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Long-term perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   Ownership at every level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Speed in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Lack of bureaucracy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

Jassy also describes Amazon as operating like the world's largest startup, emphasizing values such as inventing for customers, urgency, high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness, frugality, and deeply connected collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These are considered part of Amazon's leadership competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Organizational Structure Changes

The S-team (Amazon's senior leadership team) has been considering two main areas:
1.  Having the right organizational structure for ownership and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
2.  Being set up to invent, collaborate, and connect effectively within their [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Amazon believes improvements can be made in both areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The company has observed an increase in management layers, leading to "meetings before meetings" and managers needing to review topics before they can proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. To address this, Amazon has asked each S-team organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The aim is to remove layers and flatten organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Potential Impact of Changes

The speaker suggests that having fewer managers will likely lead to [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | layoffs]] for current middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. They argue that senior leadership (director level and above) are more often the cause of slowed processes and bureaucracy, not middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This change could also negatively impact individual contributors aspiring to management roles, potentially derailing their career paths and creating succession planning issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Fewer managers mean fewer promotion opportunities, leaving more employees stuck in their current roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Return to Office Mandate

To address the second issue of collaboration and connection, Amazon has decided to return to being in the office as they were before the onset of COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Amazon believes the advantages of being together in an office are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Impact on Employees and [[workplace_culture_shifts | Workplace Culture]]

This return-to-office (RTO) edict is particularly challenging because during the pandemic, employees were told they could work collaboratively remotely to ensure business continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Many adjusted their lifestyles, managed family logistics, set up home offices, and some even moved away from big cities for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Employees discovered they could work remotely effectively and productively, benefiting from no commutes, reduced expenses, and more family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Now, many companies, including Amazon, are issuing "return to the office or else" mandates, often with little time for employees to react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This forces employees who moved or were hired remotely to make difficult decisions: relocate to a city they didn't intend to live in (facing skyrocketing rents), or add significant costs for travel and on-site accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The speaker highlights that this abrupt shift can feel like corporate gaslighting, especially for those who accepted remote roles under the premise of continued remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The stated reason for RTO—increased collaboration and innovation—is questioned by the speaker. In their own experience at Amazon, even when in the office, teams were distributed globally, leading to continued reliance on virtual meetings rather than direct in-person collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Employees often found themselves sitting next to strangers from different divisions, making the commute and office expenses seem pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

This decision is expected to lead to many talented employees quitting Amazon, as they face significant personal and financial disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Broader Market Impact

The influx of highly skilled and credentialed Amazon employees into the job market will make the search for coveted remote positions even more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. For those seeking remote-first jobs, it is becoming increasingly less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Job seekers will need to differentiate themselves with specialized skills and strong personal branding (resume, LinkedIn strategy) to stand out in this competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. While remote opportunities still exist, they will require a targeted and expert approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

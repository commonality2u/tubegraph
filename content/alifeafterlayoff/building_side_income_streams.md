## Why Build Side Income Streams?

With forecasts indicating significant layoffs in the private sector and federal government, potentially reaching 1.7 to 2.2 million by April of next year, the job market is expected to become highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:8:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

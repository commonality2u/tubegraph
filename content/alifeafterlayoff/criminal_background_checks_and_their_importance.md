When a job offer is extended, it is often contingent upon the successful completion of a background check, which frequently includes a criminal background check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The company will typically ask for authorization to conduct this check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## How Criminal Background Checks Work
Employers generally outsource the [[employment_background_check_process | background check process]] to a third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This third party takes your information and verifies it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The criminal background check typically focuses on two main areas: felonies and misdemeanors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Felonies
A felony conviction is considered much more serious and can often be a significant barrier to entry for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. If a felony occurred more than seven years ago, it may still be flagged, and the employer will need to decide whether to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Misdemeanors
A misdemeanor is a less serious criminal conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Generally, a misdemeanor alone will not prevent someone from getting a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, this is assessed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the conviction, and the human resources department makes the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Other Checks
Criminal background checks will also look for pending court cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. They typically review about seven years of your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Additionally, the check can identify if there are any active warrants for your arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Juvenile infractions are usually not reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Verification Process
To verify your criminal background, the third-party company will identify all locations you have lived in for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. They then contact the local courthouses in each of those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In some cases, older courthouses may not have electronic systems, requiring manual file retrieval, which can cause delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Importance of Disclosure
It is always advisable to disclose any criminal background at the time of the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This ensures the employer is fully aware and avoids any surprises when the background check is conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. If anything in your background might be flagged, it's better to disclose it early in the offer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Lying on your job application or resume, which is considered a legal document, can lead to serious [[consequences_of_failing_an_employment_background_check | consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Even after employment, if an employer discovers a discrepancy in your credentials, you can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Falsifying information, such as having a friend or relative act as an [[employment_verification_in_background_checks | employment verifier]], carries a high risk of the job offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It is crucial to be honest and forthcoming about your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

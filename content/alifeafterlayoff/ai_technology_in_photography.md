## Overview of AI-Generated Headshots

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has introduced new ways to create professional images, particularly for online platforms like LinkedIn. Users can now generate professional-looking headshots using AI applications, potentially saving time and cost associated with traditional photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technology is viewed as a potential game-changer for individuals who are not satisfied with their current [[ai_generated_linkedin_headshots | LinkedIn headshots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

A good profile picture is considered a necessity for attracting the right career opportunities and branding oneself effectively on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## How AI Headshot Generation Works

An application named "Remini" has gained popularity for generating AI headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The process typically involves:
1.  **Uploading Photos:** Users upload a collection of their selfies to the app, usually 8 to 12 photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[02:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[03:29]</a>.
2.  **Creating a Custom Profile:** The app processes these photos to create a custom profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
3.  **Selecting a Reference Style:** Users can select a reference image or aesthetic (e.g., "modern," "Korean aesthetic") to guide the AI's generation of their headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  **Generation:** The AI then generates a variety of professional headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Results from others have shown the AI-generated images to be "pretty insane" and "look like they're professional headshots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[02:40]</a>. Some results are remarkably convincing, while others might appear slightly artificial, such as details around the shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[02:50]</a>.

## Personal Experiment with Remini

An experiment with the Remini app involved uploading selfies and selecting a "curriculum" aesthetic for the generated headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[04:18]</a>. The initial results were described as "not bad at all," with one making the individual look younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[04:38]</a>. Subsequent generations also produced satisfactory images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[04:58]</a>. An additional test for a spouse also yielded "pretty remarkable" results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[05:21]</a>.

## Concerns and Recommendations

A significant concern with AI headshot apps is the potential for [[ethical_considerations_of_using_ai_for_headshots | catfishing]], where a generated photo does not accurately represent the individual's current appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[05:31]</a>.

For responsible use, it is recommended to:
*   Use source photos that accurately reflect how one currently looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[05:38]</a>.
*   Utilize the tool to create a clean and professional-looking headshot, rather than one that completely alters one's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[05:44]</a>.

## Impact on Professional Headshot Photographers

The emergence of AI technology for headshot generation presents an "interesting dilemma" for [[potential_impact_of_ai_on_professional_headshot_photographers | headshot photographers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[03:03]</a>. Previously a lucrative field, the speaker wonders how this AI advancement might affect their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[03:09]</a>. Despite these developments, AI-generated headshots offer an alternative for those who wish to upgrade their LinkedIn profile without incurring the cost of professional photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[05:57]</a>.

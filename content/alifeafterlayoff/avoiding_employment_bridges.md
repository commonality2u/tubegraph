When leaving a job, it is crucial to do so gracefully and professionally to avoid "burning bridges" that could impact your future career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This advice comes from a corporate recruiter and HR professional with over 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Whether you're leaving for a promotional opportunity, to [[strategies_for_career_advancement_without_job_hopping | further your career]], or escaping a bad situation, the rules for departure remain the same: leave with grace and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## Why Not to Burn Bridges

Leaving a job in a spectacular, negative way, such as storming out, kicking over a computer, or telling colleagues to "take this job and shove it," is strongly discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. While it might provide a day or two of satisfaction, it has significant long-term repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

The consequences of burning bridges include:
*   Becoming ineligible for rehire at that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   Damaging your professional reputation, potentially being seen as a "risk" or "loose cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   Losing potential future referrals from former colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   Limiting future networking opportunities, which are powerful ways to find jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
*   Destroying potential future references from former bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
*   Closing the door to potential future employment at the same organization or with former colleagues/bosses at new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
*   Negatively impacting your "employment brand," which follows you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

## Steps for a Graceful Exit

### Preparation Before Announcing
If you are dissatisfied with your job or boss, do not tell anyone you are looking to leave until you have secured another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Informing your boss too soon might lead to a quicker departure than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. It's easier to find a job when you are currently employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

Before giving notice, ensure all your "ducks are in a row" with the new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Confirmed drug screen results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   Completed background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   Confirmed references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   A confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   Wait for a "green light" from the new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

There have been cases where job offers were pulled due to background check issues after a candidate had already given notice to their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

It is critical to keep your job search discreet, even from close work friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. If rumors spread, it can "come back and bite you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Maintain professionalism and keep it very tight-lipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Notifying Your Boss
Once you have a confirmed start date with your new employer, set a meeting with your current boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This meeting should be face-to-face or via a Zoom call, not an email or text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

During the meeting:
*   Keep your message short, sweet, and to the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   State that you have accepted another opportunity that is the "best move for your family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   Thank them for the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   State that you are giving your two weeks' notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   Avoid elaborating on negative reasons for leaving (e.g., "you're a bad boss," "I hated the job") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This only creates animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   Maintain "emotion zero point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>, as your decision is already made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   Do not entertain counter offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   Take the high road and be professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

### Informing Colleagues and Clients
Always let your boss know first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Do not let them find out through the "grapevine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. After informing your boss, ask for their opinion on when it's a good time to start letting co-workers and clients know about your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Wait for their green light to ensure you follow proper protocol and leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

When informing colleagues and clients, remember that your departure will create a void and increase their workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Be gracious and appreciative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

Consider directly contacting individuals who were instrumental in your career (e.g., those who trained you, provided guidance, or gave you opportunities) to give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Ask them to join your personal network, connecting on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Building strong networks is vital for future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### Giving Notice
You should absolutely give at least two weeks' notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. While not legally required, it allows you to tie up loose ends and, more importantly, is a courtesy to your fellow co-workers and boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. The notice period is designed to prevent "screwing over" the people you worked with, who would otherwise have to scramble to cover your work and reassign tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Be considerate of those who will pick up the pieces after you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Last Day Conduct
On your last day, gather your immediate team or influential colleagues for a brief huddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Briefly explain your departure with a high-level, generic reason, such as having a better opportunity that is good for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

Maintain a positive tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Do not trash the company, the job, or your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Instead, focus on positive aspects like:
*   "I really loved working with you guys." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>
*   "The team was great." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>
*   "It was a great time to grow my career here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>
*   Thank everyone specifically and sincerely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

It's advisable to maintain good working relationships because you never know if things might not work out in your new role, and you might need to return or require references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. Consider asking your current boss if you would be considered for rehire if circumstances change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Always try to leave an organization on good terms with former bosses, as they will be needed for references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. Ensure your performance remains acceptable until your last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

How you treat people when you leave an organization will reflect on you and follow you throughout your entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Always aim to leave on good terms and create a great impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

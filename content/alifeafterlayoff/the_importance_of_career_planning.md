Brian from "A Life After Layoff" emphasizes the critical need for individuals to act like the CEO of their own careers, taking ownership and planning strategically, rather than passively waiting for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. By recounting his own career mistakes, he highlights how a lack of proactive planning can lead to stagnation, missed opportunities, and significant professional and financial setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## A Cautionary Tale: Brian's Career Journey

Early in his career, Brian was recruited into a relatively small company in the railroad services industry, with about 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His role, officially "Staffing and Development Manager," focused on recruiting and employee relations, evolving into a Human Resources Manager position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The work was engaging, allowing him to impact the business and witness employee growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The premise for accepting the role was a clear promise: the Vice President of Human Resources was set to retire in 18 months, and Brian was to learn the ropes and then be promoted into his role to run the entire HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The company fostered a family-oriented atmosphere, and Brian enjoyed a high degree of freedom and a laid-back work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### The Stagnation Begins

Despite the initial promise, Brian's boss, who had significant influence and a "little kingdom" within the company, showed no intention of retiring when the 18 months passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Brian continued to wait, believing his promotion would eventually come, especially as he was part of a leadership development group groomed for senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

However, other leaders in the organization also clung to their positions, enjoying substantial bonuses and unwilling to relinquish control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Brian's boss repeatedly told him he wasn't "ready yet" and needed more development, but failed to provide actual opportunities for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Peers Advance, Brian Stays Put

Meanwhile, Brian's peers in the leadership development group, who were also facing similar obstacles, began to leave the organization one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Only a small fraction of them ultimately achieved the promised level within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These "astute" individuals recognized they shouldn't wait for recognition and pursued opportunities elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Brian, however, stayed. He had a steady job, was well-regarded, and felt comfortable, mistakenly believing that his boss would eventually retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. What was supposed to be 18 months turned into nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### The Consequences of Apathy and Inaction

After about seven years, Brian gave up on his dream of becoming the head of HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He eventually transitioned to a different role within the company for his last two years there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. His boss eventually retired nine years after his initial promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Brian regrets how he handled his career, admitting he became apathetic and overly comfortable, prioritizing a steady paycheck over active advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. He didn't push for what he wanted and allowed the narrative of "you're not ready" to erode his self-belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. He stopped caring about going above and beyond or seeking promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

By staying too long and not acting like the CEO of his career, Brian fell behind his peers who were advancing to director-level positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. He also stopped learning, failed to keep up with industry trends, and fell behind in terms of skills, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This made finding a new job difficult, forcing him to take a step down in responsibility to gain updated recruiting experience at larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This mistake set him back by a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## The Importance of Strategic Career Planning

Brian's experience underscores the vital role of [[the_importance_of_being_a_proactive_career_planner | proactive career planning]] and [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | having a guiding principle]]. He stresses the distinction between playing "checkers" and "chess" with one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Playing checkers means having no plan or strategy, simply waiting for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Playing chess, conversely, involves strategic foresight and actively pursuing one's career goals.

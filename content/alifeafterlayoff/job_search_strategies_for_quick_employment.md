When seeking to get hired as quickly as possible, it is essential to prioritize job search activities that offer the best return on investment for your time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. This article ranks 15 different ways to look for a job, from least to most effective, based on the subjective experience of a corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience interviewing and hiring thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. The rankings consider the speed of employment and the efficiency of time spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. Distinctions between blue-collar and white-collar applicability are also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.

## Ranking Methodology

The recruiter's rankings are based on personal experience rather than objective fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. Each method is assigned a score between 1 and 10, with 10 representing the best "bang for your buck" and 1 being the least effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.

## Job Search Methods Ranked

### Least Effective (1/10)

*   **Cold Calling**
    Cold calling involves soliciting a job without knowing if the employer has an open position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>. This can include phone calls to HR departments, unannounced office visits, or sending unsolicited notes/resumes on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>. As a corporate recruiter, this method almost never works due to the high energy expenditure for minimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 1/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:29">[02:25:29]</a>

*   **Social Media Engagement**
    Engaging with a company's social media (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) in hopes of being noticed by a hiring team is very unlikely to lead to an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:02">[02:31:02]</a>. HR and talent acquisition teams typically do not manage social media, which is usually handled by marketing departments, especially in larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:43">[02:47:43]</a>. Recruiters rarely, if ever, hire someone based on social media engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 1/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:08">[03:38:08]</a>

### Low Effectiveness (2-3/10)

*   **Job Fairs**
    Job fairs, often held by unemployment centers or universities, can be effective, particularly for blue-collar or entry-level university roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>. While recruiters have hired from job fairs, the chances of finding a highly qualified candidate for specific positions are slim from an employer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:44">[04:08:44]</a>. For job seekers, it's akin to window shopping, making it an untargeted way to search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:48">[04:57:48]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 2/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:47">[05:04:47]</a>

*   **Industry Events / In-Person Networking**
    These events involve mixing with people in your industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:23">[05:18:23]</a>. It's generally an untargeted approach, as the likelihood of someone having an immediate job opening that fits your profile is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:02">[05:31:02]</a>. While it can create long-term contacts, it's not ideal for quick employment, especially for introverts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:19">[06:00:19]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 3/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:24">[06:10:24]</a>

*   **Online Forums**
    Online forums like Reddit or tech-specific forums, including LinkedIn groups, can be used for networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:24">[06:22:24]</a>. However, it's often untargeted for job searching, and when opportunities arise, competition can be fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:58">[06:36:58]</a>. While recruiters may source candidates demonstrating high aptitude in niche areas, actively building a knowledge repository for immediate job search is not the most efficient use of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:38">[07:07:38]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 3/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:34">[07:37:34]</a>

### Moderate Effectiveness (4-6/10)

*   **Professional Associations**
    Joining professional associations relevant to your industry (e.g., Society for Human Resource Management - SHRM) can be beneficial, especially for white-collar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:01">[07:42:01]</a>. Becoming known as an expert or joining a committee can help brand yourself within a local labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:10">[08:04:10]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 4/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:15">[08:22:15]</a>

*   **Company Websites**
    Applying directly on a company's website ensures your resume is seen by the recruiter, unlike some external job board applications that might not filter into the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:09">[08:38:09]</a>. If you see a job on a job board, applying directly on the company's website might increase your chances of being noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:06">[09:11:06]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 5/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:04">[09:22:04]</a>

*   **Headhunters / Agencies / Job Houses**
    These third-party recruiters contract with employers to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:05">[09:29:05]</a>. While they work with multiple employers, if you're not a fit for the primary role, their interest may quickly fizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:07">[09:48:07]</a>. It doesn't cost job seekers anything, but you shouldn't rely solely on them; continued personal job search effort is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:02">[10:12:02]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 5/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:06">[10:29:06]</a>

*   **Personal Website / Blog**
    Setting up a website or blog to brand yourself as an expert and showcase a portfolio of work is especially powerful for creative roles (e.g., design, photography) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:03">[10:44:03]</a>. Writing niche content can attract companies seeking experts, but it requires effort and does not yield immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:21">[11:06:21]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 5/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:44">[11:23:44]</a>

*   **Job Boards**
    Applying through job boards like LinkedIn or Indeed is a common practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:13">[11:39:13]</a>. The challenge is competing with many other applicants without knowing your standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:21">[11:48:21]</a>. While employers use various methods to find candidates, a high volume of applicants can make it difficult to get noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:21">[12:01:21]</a>. Recruiters estimate only 5-10% of their jobs are filled through active job postings due to misaligned candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:02">[13:32:02]</a>. Despite the effort and potential for [[applicant_frustrations_with_job_search_strategies | applicant frustrations]], it only takes one offer to become employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:02">[13:12:02]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 6/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:46">[12:57:46]</a>

### High Effectiveness (7-8/10)

*   **Online Networking**
    Less intimidating than in-person networking, online networking, typically on platforms like LinkedIn, requires specific etiquette to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:09">[13:17:09]</a>. Simply sending unsolicited connection requests or InMails is unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:04">[13:33:04]</a>. Targeted online networking is a powerful [[strategies_for_improving_job_search_success | strategy for improving job search success]] when done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:03">[13:52:03]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 7/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:08">[13:58:08]</a>

*   **Responding to Advertisements**
    This refers to "help wanted" signs on billboards, trucks, or storefronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:57">[14:03:57]</a>. These opportunities tend to have a decent return rate because companies actively advertising outwards are often struggling to find applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:07">[14:40:07]</a>. This method is more effective for blue-collar roles than white-collar positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:06">[14:56:06]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 7/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:06">[15:06:06]</a>

*   **Internships / Co-ops**
    For entry-level job seekers, internships or co-ops are highly recommended, especially when lacking relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:04">[15:10:04]</a>. They provide a competitive edge and a foot in the door with organizations, fostering goodwill with potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:44">[15:23:44]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 7/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:07">[15:39:07]</a>

*   **Industry Contacts**
    Leveraging past working relationships, especially with former bosses or close colleagues who are now at other organizations, is a powerful way to secure a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:53">[15:43:53]</a>. These contacts can often pull you along to a new company, potentially bypassing extensive interview processes and ensuring fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:05">[16:07:05]</a>.
    *   **Rating: 8/10** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:04">[16:47:04]</a>

*   **Employee Referrals**
    If you know someone working at a company with an open position, reaching out for a referral is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:04">[16:55:04]</a>. Referrers often receive a bonus, and referred candidates almost always get preference over external applicants, effectively skipping to the front of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:01">[17:07:01]</a>. This is a crucial [[effective_job_search_strategies | effective job search strategy]].

### Most Effective (10/10)

*   **Outbound Sourcing**
    This is the most common way recruiters fill positions, accounting for 80% or more of hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:03">[17:44:03]</a>. Outbound sourcing involves recruiters actively searching the market (e.g., LinkedIn) for candidates who closely match specific job profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. While you can't control what a recruiter is looking for, you can make yourself discoverable for desired jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:29">[18:02:29]</a>. Being discovered means you are pulled directly to the front of the line, often bypassing the full application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:47">[18:11:47]</a>. Understanding how recruiters source and making yourself discoverable is the single best thing for an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:10">[18:35:10]</a>.

## Recommended Strategies for Job Seekers

For an active job search focused on quick employment, prioritize:
*   Improving your discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:03">[18:49:03]</a>
*   Optimizing your LinkedIn profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:06">[18:50:06]</a>
*   Networking with industry contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:06">[18:53:06]</a>
*   Seeking employee referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:04">[18:57:04]</a>

While these are the most impactful [[job_search_strategies_and_career_management | strategies for finding a new job]], it is still advisable to sprinkle in applications via job boards as part of a comprehensive [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_navigate_the_job_market | job search strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:07">[19:00:07]</a>. The goal is to maximize your results by spending time on activities that yield the most opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:06">[19:11:06]</a>.

The current state of the labor market is widely described as a disaster, with stories of employees being treated poorly during [[trends_in_tech_job_market_and_layoffs | reductions in force]] becoming increasingly common in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. This has led many to question if the workplace is broken beyond repair and to reevaluate how individuals approach their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. A "seismic shift" is currently underway in the [[current_job_market_analysis_and_opportunities | employment market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Corporate Loyalty

Historically, the employer-employee relationship fostered a high degree of loyalty:

*   **Grandfather's Generation**: Individuals often worked for a single employer for 50 years, receiving a paycheck and a pension upon retirement. Employers viewed employees as assets throughout their careers, and "job hopping" was almost unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>.
*   **Baby Boomer Generation**: Similar values persisted, with high corporate loyalty. Employees invested in a company and career path, enduring both good and bad times, sometimes relocating for work. While layoffs occurred, they were not as common as they appear today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>. This generation also typically relied on pensions, a benefit rarely offered by companies now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:30">[04:13:30]</a>.

## The Erosion of Corporate Loyalty

Over time, the mutual loyalty between employees and corporations has eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>.

*   **Shift from Pensions to 401ks**: Pensions, being entirely employer-funded, were largely replaced by 401ks, which shift costs to employees and are less beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This marked an early sign of employers decoupling their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:19">[04:47:19]</a>.
*   **Rising Medical Premiums**: Companies began sharing medical premium costs, weakening benefits and further decoupling employer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:01">[05:27:01]</a>.
*   **Loss of Job Security**: Corporations no longer maintain job security. Instead of reducing expenses in other ways during rough patches, they now initiate mass [[trends_in_tech_job_market_and_layoffs | layoffs]] at a moment's notice to prioritize corporate profitability and shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Many recent [[current_job_market_and_rising_layoffs | layoffs]] are not due to companies losing money, but to "lean out" and maximize future profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Impact of the Pandemic on the Job Market

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the [[employment_trends_during_the_pandemic | labor market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>:

*   **Initial Downturn and Layoffs**: At the start of the pandemic, the economy shut down, leading to immediate layoffs as a "knee-jerk reaction" by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Many companies falsely assured staff there would be no layoffs, only to conduct them the following week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Rebound and Over-Hiring**: Companies quickly realized profit opportunities and aggressively ramped up production. In a "greedy fashion," they rushed to acquire as much talent as possible, leading to a soaring job market, especially for professions like software developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Companies threw "buckets of money" at candidates due to excessive demand and limited supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Return to Layoffs**: The rapid hiring and overcompensation were unsustainable. At the first sign of economic trouble, companies collectively began cutting staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. This "easy come, easy go" cycle of layoffs is a pattern, with companies following suit once a few leaders initiate cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. Many roles were eliminated not because companies were losing money, but to maximize profitability and improve financial stats for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Disturbing Trends in Layoff Practices

The manner in which companies execute [[current_job_market_challenges | layoffs]] is particularly alarming, highlighting an "unhealthy relationship" between companies and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. The "Great Resignation" and "Quiet Quitting" movements are seen as symptoms of this underlying issue, affecting nearly all industries and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

Here are some real-life examples of insensitive layoff practices:

*   **Email During Injury Recovery**: An individual, still recovering from a car accident (concussion, bruising) that occurred on Sunday, received an email on Monday morning stating her role was eliminated due to [[trends_in_tech_job_market_and_layoffs | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She expressed regret for chasing deals while injured, urging others to prioritize self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.
*   **During Paternity Leave**: A Zoom employee was laid off via email while on paternity leave, bonding with his infant daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. This forced him to immediately seek new employment and consider expensive COBRA coverage for his family's healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   **During Bereavement Leave**: An employee at Ada was laid off while on bereavement leave for his father's funeral, moments before the ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. No HR or manager intervened to delay the layoff, despite the company likely claiming to treat employees "like family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.
*   **Eight Days into a New Job**: A recruiter experienced their second non-performance-based layoff in three months. After an extensive interview process (seven hours of interviews, days of prep, withdrawing from other opportunities), she accepted a role, only for 80% of her team to be cut eight days after she started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Accidental Early Notification**: A senior manager in Human Resources at a healthcare company (Nomad Health) received an accidental 1 AM email from the CEO, notifying her of her position's elimination weeks before the planned layoff date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.
*   **Excessive Interview Processes**: Some companies subject candidates, even for roles like recruiters, to incredibly demanding interview processes (e.g., 30-minute presentations, half-day interviews with 12 people grilling them), only to unceremoniously lay them off shortly after hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.
*   **"Pipelining" Requisitions**: A major tech employer laid off many staff (software developers, HR) but simultaneously posted "pipelining" job requisitions â€“ positions they had no intention of filling. These roles are used to collect applications for a future hiring pool, creating false hope for candidates, particularly those recently laid off by the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:11]</a>.

### The Tragic Human Cost

In the most extreme cases, the stress and impact of [[trends_in_tech_job_market_and_layoffs | layoffs]] have led to devastating consequences:

> "Do the horrible side effects of the layoffs, unfortunately I lost a friend this week. She had survived various layoffs throughout 2022 but was let go on Friday or on Wednesday the February the 1st through a zoom call. Within two days she had taken her life." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>

The video highlights that companies carelessly hire people away from existing jobs, disrupting their lives and leading them to pass up other opportunities. Then, without regard for the human impact, executives make decisions to cut headcount that can have "very real and permanent impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are experiencing emotional difficulty due to a layoff or are considering a permanent option, please seek help. No job or employer is worth it. You can navigate through this.

## Recommendations for Navigating the Current Job Market

Given these [[current_challenges_in_the_job_market | challenges]], individuals must adopt a new approach to their careers:

*   **Act Like a Free Agent**: The current [[job_market_and_career_strategies | job market]] demands that individuals act like free agents, prioritizing self-care and not relying on a single income or employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>.
*   **Diversify Income Streams**: Start working on side hustles and diversify income streams to protect yourself and your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>.
*   **Be Prepared**: Do not assume layoffs won't happen to you. Even top performers can receive unexpected layoff notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluate Long-Term Career Expectations**: The idea of a long-term career within a single organization is likely no longer a reality for the vast majority of workers. Careers are likely to become more "nomadic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>.
*   **Eyes Wide Open During Interviews**: When interviewing, be "eyes wide open." Ask hiring managers difficult questions about their business plans and, more importantly, their past performance regarding layoffs (e.g., in 2020 or 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>. Past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>.
*   **Companies as Commodities**: Companies now treat people as commodities, cutting them when no longer useful, with little accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>. This cycle repeats, with companies rehiring people back when the market picks up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>.

The workplace has been fractured, and the speaker believes it will continue to worsen through 2023, impacting more industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>.

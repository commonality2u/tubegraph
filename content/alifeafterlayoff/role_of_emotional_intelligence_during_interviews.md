If candidates are receiving job interviews but not progressing to an offer, it often indicates they are making specific errors during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. As a recruiter and human resources professional with 20 years of experience, hiring managers frequently discuss why some candidates receive offers while others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In today's competitive market, employers are highly selective, making it crucial for candidates to bring their "A game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Emotional Intelligence as a Factor

One common mistake that can stem from a lack of emotional intelligence is talking too much during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While nervousness can contribute to this, it can also reflect a candidate's inability to fully grasp the question being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Understanding Emotional Intelligence in Interviews

In an interview setting, emotional intelligence essentially means the ability to accurately gauge another person's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This includes looking for verbal or physical cues from the interviewer to understand if your answer is on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Experienced interviewers often provide both verbal and non-verbal feedback to indicate whether a candidate is hitting the mark or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Candidates who lack this skill might:
*   Fail to take the time to formulate an answer to what's being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Start speaking without a clear direction, then question if they are answering correctly, leading them to branch off into unrelated topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Ultimately fail to answer the original question while rambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

When a candidate rambles, interviewers may try to stop and refocus the question, rephrasing it or offering hints to what they are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. A candidate who rambles often does not understand what the interviewer is seeking, feeling compelled to "over-answer" the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Demonstrating Self-Awareness

Every question asked in an interview has a specific purpose, aiming to learn particular aspects of a candidate's background relevant to the job profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Rather than guessing the answer and rambling, it is better to pause the interview and seek clarification from the interviewer, such as: "I think you're asking me about this, but can you clarify? I just want to make sure that I'm giving you the right information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Recruiters appreciate this approach as it demonstrates a degree of self-awareness and business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Interviewers are generally happy to clarify, as they are not trying to trick candidates but rather to understand their background for the next round of interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

It is generally better to provide a thorough yet concise answer rather than too much detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Skilled interviewers will ask additional probing questions if more information is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

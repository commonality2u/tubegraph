The speaker emphasizes the critical importance of acting like the "CEO of your career" to effectively navigate career transitions and avoid stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His personal story serves as a cautionary tale of how becoming too comfortable and not proactively managing one's career can lead to significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## A Missed Opportunity: The Story of Career Stagnation

Early in his career, the speaker was recruited into a small company in the railroad services industry, with approximately 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His official title was Staffing and Development Manager, which evolved into a Human Resources Manager role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The work was substantial and provided valuable experience, allowing him to impact the business directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The primary reason he accepted the position was the promise of a clear career path: he was supposed to learn from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was slated to retire in 18 months, after which the speaker would be promoted to lead the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### The Stalling Promotion and Apathy

Despite the initial promise, the VP of HR, who had an "old school" approach and a "little kingdom" within the company, showed no true intention of retiring after 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This leader, along with other senior executives due to retire around the same time, seemed reluctant to relinquish their influence and lucrative bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The speaker was part of a leadership development group, being groomed for senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, his boss frequently told him he "wasn't ready yet" and needed more development, without actually providing growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Peers in his leadership group faced similar issues, and many started leaving the organization when their promotions didn't materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. One peer even became a president at a competitor company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Out of eight to ten people in his succession group, only one or two achieved their expected level within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The speaker, however, remained, becoming "very apathetic" and "very comfortable just collecting a steady paycheck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. He didn't push for advancement, believing the promised promotion would eventually happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. What was supposed to be an 18-month wait turned into nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### The "Joe" Analogy and Consequences of Inaction

The speaker likens his situation to the concept of "Joe" from his video on why steady jobs can be detrimental to a career, implying he stayed too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. While his astute peers in the leadership group took off after two or three years, recognizing the lack of opportunity, he waited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

This inaction had several negative consequences:
*   **Stagnation:** He fell behind his peer group, who were moving into director-level roles, while he remained at a manager's level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Confidence:** Repeatedly being told "you're not ready" caused him to doubt his own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Loss of Passion:** He stopped caring about being the HR manager, going into "autopilot," and no longer striving to go "above and beyond" or volunteer for new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This highlights a key challenge in [[navigating_career_pivots_and_finding_passion_in_work|navigating career pivots and finding passion in work]].
*   **Skill Gap:** He stopped learning, keeping up with industry trends, or latest technologies, causing him to fall behind when he eventually re-entered the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Financial Loss:** He realized he was significantly behind market compensation because he hadn't assessed his market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### The Eventual Transition and Step Back

After about seven years, the speaker gave up on his dream of becoming the head of HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. A senior leader recognized his talent in other areas (marketing, photography, creative work) and pulled him into a different role within the company for his last two years there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

When he eventually left the organization, he realized he had to take a step downward in responsibility to gain the necessary recruiting experience, as that was the part of his previous role he enjoyed most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. He spent several years at a recruiter level to gain deeper experience at larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This meant his career was set back by about a decade compared to his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Lessons Learned: Playing Chess with Your Career

The speaker's experience underscores that not having a plan, strategy, or guidance on [[navigating_career_transitions_and_job_market_changes|managing your career]] like a "chess player" can lead to significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Instead, he was merely "playing checkers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

He emphasizes that career runways shorten quickly, especially in mid-career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Waiting for opportunities to come to you or for someone to recognize your efforts is a "waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

> "If you're just being apathetic, you're letting the work come to you, you're letting the opportunities come to you, you're just kind of waiting around for things to happen, you're wasting your time and you're not acting like the CEO of your career." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>

## Strategies for Proactive Career Management

For those looking to move ahead, especially when feeling stuck or frustrated, the speaker advises:

*   **Take Ownership:** Start acting like the CEO of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Assess Your Situation:** Determine if you are spending too much time in one organization, waiting for recognition, or stuck because you're "too good at your job" in a particular role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This requires constant evaluation, similar to [[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth|job hopping strategies for career growth]] or [[strategies_for_career_advancement_without_job_hopping|strategies for career advancement without job hopping]].
*   **Build an Effective Resume:** A strong resume is crucial to getting noticed by recruiters who value your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Market Yourself Effectively:** When interviewing, especially for a role shift, you must convince [[role_shifts_and_hiring_manager_challenges|hiring managers]] that you are a good fit. They are often "risk adverse" and look for exact matches, but high-potential candidates may not be interested in lateral moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Test the Open Market Consistently:** A true "CEO of their career" or "free agent" should always entertain other opportunities and keep themselves available for the best possible roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[navigating_the_competitive_job_market|navigating the competitive job market]].
*   **Leverage Networks:** Use platforms like LinkedIn to get recruiters to contact you, rather than always applying for jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Ultimately, proactive career management involves continuous learning, strategic planning, and a willingness to move when opportunities for growth are stalled.

Congratulations on landing an interview! To ensure you make the best impression and avoid common [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_job_interviews | interview mistakes]], it's crucial to be mindful of what personal information you share with recruiters and hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Interviewing can feel like navigating a minefield, where one wrong step can land you in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Personal Facts and Oversharing

Avoid revealing too many personal facts about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This often indicates nervousness or being long-winded, neither of which are desirable traits when trying to impress an interview team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Employers link your ability to articulate yourself to how you would perform in a business setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

*   **Long-Windedness**: If you go on and on, interviewers may interpret it as a lack of emotional intelligence or an inability to convey thoughts clearly and concisely, which could negatively impact your perceived professional communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Aim for interview answers that are generally two to three minutes in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Nervous Oversharing**: If you overshare due to nerves, it suggests you need more practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Personal Bias**: Sharing personal information, like a hobby, risks the interviewer developing a bias for or against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While it could create an icebreaker, it's generally best to avoid particularly personal details and keep the conversation strictly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Reasons for Leaving Your Current Employer

Avoid revealing the "real" reason you're leaving your current employer, especially if it's negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This doesn't mean lying, but be strategic about what you share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   **Negative Boss/Company**: If you complain about a terrible boss or poor treatment, an employer might perceive you as difficult to work with or a potential problem for them, leading to a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Boredom/Lack of Challenge**: Stating you were bored or unchallenged in your previous role might suggest to an employer that you lack initiative to find more enriching work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Figure out the true reason for your departure and articulate it in a way that doesn't seem threatening to a prospective employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Future Career Plans

Oversharing your long-term career plans can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. When asked about your career path or where you see yourself in five years, employers want to assess your commitment to the role and potential for growth within their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

*   **Starting a Business/Career Switch**: Stating a five-year plan to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely is generally viewed negatively and can be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. It suggests a lack of passion for the job you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Conveying passion for the work is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Managing Expectations**: If you do have plans for a business or career shift, plan how you will message this information during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Desperation for a Job

Avoid revealing that you are desperate for a job, even if you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Employers may perceive this as a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Just like in dating, a high sense of urgency can push the desired outcome further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Even in difficult financial situations, project a calm and collected demeanor to avoid being placed in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Age and Retirement Plans

Do not reveal your age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Age discrimination can occur for both younger and older candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Be careful with technologies or email addresses that might indicate your age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Similarly, do not indicate how many years you have left in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While a recruiter shouldn't consider this, if they become aware of your short-term plans, it can become a liability and create bias against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Hiring managers often seek candidates with long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Medical Issues and Disabilities

Avoid revealing major medical issues during an interview, unless they prohibit you from meeting the basic job requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Employers *should* ask if you can meet the requirements of the position during the application process, and you should answer truthfully then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **Pregnancy and Disabilities**: You are not required to disclose pregnancy, and it is illegal to not hire someone because they are pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Similarly, if you have a disability that doesn't interfere with your ability to perform the job, it's not recommended to bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Reasonable Accommodation**: If a reasonable accommodation is required, it should be indicated in the application or discussed with the recruiter if they ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. For non-interfering disabilities, the appropriate time to discuss it, if necessary, is typically at the time of an offer, not during the interview itself, to avoid inadvertently creating bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Candidates are hired for their ability to perform the job based on the job description requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Political Belief System

Never reveal your political belief system in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Politics are sensitive and opinionated, and you never know the hiring manager's views, even if the company's mission seems aligned with your core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Previous Salary

Do not reveal your previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. When the salary question comes up, typically during the recruiter phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, disclosing your past salary can lock you into a lower offer, especially if you were underpaid for your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

You, as the employee, should determine your worth based on the open market value for your skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities, rather than letting an employer determine it based on your past earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

These insights are based on years of recruiting experience and are designed to help you navigate job interviews successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

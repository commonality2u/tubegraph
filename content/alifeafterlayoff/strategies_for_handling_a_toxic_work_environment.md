When you find yourself in a situation where you have an uneasy feeling about your employment, it's important to recognize the signs and understand your options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This scenario is often referred to as "quiet firing," a company's attempt to subtly push an employee out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In HR, this is known as [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | constructive dismissal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Understanding Constructive Dismissal
[[understanding_and_identifying_toxic_workplaces | Constructive dismissal]] occurs when a company makes your work or employment situation so unbearable that you feel you have no option but to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Companies might do this to avoid potential problems with termination, or to prevent paying out benefits like unemployment insurance if you leave voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### [[Recognizing a toxic work culture | Signs of a Toxic Work Environment]] (Quiet Firing)
Several [[signs of a toxic work environment | signs]] can indicate a company is trying to push you out:
*   **No Raises** You haven't received a raise in several years, especially if others in your department have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Passed Over for Promotions** You've been repeatedly overlooked for promotions, even when you've positioned yourself as the best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Denied PTO** Your requests for paid time off or vacation are repeatedly denied, assuming you're not abusing it and have coordinated coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** You've been placed on a PIP or similar performance management tool, especially if the plan seems unreasonable or not based in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Schedule Manipulation** Your schedule is suddenly messed with, either through mandatory overtime during known unavailable periods, or a reduction of hours to the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Increased Workload** An unbearable amount of work is dumped on you with no additional pay or unreasonable hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Lackluster Performance Appraisals** Your performance reviews are suddenly poor, especially if you previously had good ones, and your boss becomes overly critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of Communication from Boss** Your boss stops communicating with you, misses one-on-ones, doesn't respond to emails, or is generally unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Removal from Work/Meetings** You are suddenly removed from projects you typically led, not invited to staff meetings, or excluded from general workplace discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

While one or two [[signs of a toxic workplace | signs]] alone don't confirm quiet firing, you should start paying attention and trust your gut if you notice several <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## [[Strategies for leaving a toxic work environment | Strategies for Handling a Toxic Work Environment]]
If you find yourself in a situation where you believe the company is constructively discharging you, you have options:

### Option 1: Force the Company's Hand
You can continue the status quo and let the company terminate you if that's their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Option 2: Act Like a Free Agent and Quit
Quit your job and seek a more supportive workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   Staying in a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic environment]] is detrimental to your personal life, [[impact_of_a_toxic_workplace_on_mental and physical health | mental health]], and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   By actively seeking new opportunities, you "act like a free agent" and make decisions that best serve your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Proactive Steps:**
    *   Update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   Start networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   Begin exploring the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   It is always best practice to have your resume up-to-date and ready, rather than scrambling when you need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Option 3: Seek Legal Counsel for Discrimination
If you suspect you are being discriminated against for any reason, find a local attorney to help you understand relevant laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

> Regardless of the situation, trusting your gut is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Always prioritize your well-being by pursuing a place that supports your career and personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Quitting a job gracefully and professionally is crucial for maintaining your [[maintaining_professional_relationships_after_resignation | professional reputation]] and future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. As a corporate recruiter and HR professional with over 20 years of experience, the speaker emphasizes the importance of leaving with grace and dignity, regardless of your [[reasons_for_leaving_a_job_and_how_to_discuss_them | reasons for leaving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Why Proper Resignation Matters

The "wrong way" to quit involves storming out, being destructive, or making a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Such actions will lead to being ineligible for rehire, burning bridges with the employer and colleagues, and potentially even legal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A spectacular exit might provide momentary satisfaction, but it can label you as a "loose cannon," making former colleagues hesitant to refer you for future positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Confirm New Job Details
Before giving notice, ensure all your "ducks are in a row" for your new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This includes:
*   Confirmed drug screen results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Completed background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>
*   References checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   A confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>

Waiting for all these confirmations is crucial, as job offers can be rescinded if issues arise during pre-employment checks, leaving you without either job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. New employers typically understand and respect your need to confirm these details before giving notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Keep it Confidential
Do not tell anyone you are looking for another job or have an offer until you are absolutely ready to move on and have a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Telling your current employer too soon could result in you being out of a job quicker than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
It's also advisable to keep your job search and new opportunity confidential, even from close work friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Rumors can spread and cause issues if something falls through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Your boss should be the first to know, not the last through the rumor mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## How to Deliver Your Resignation

### Set a Meeting with Your Boss
Once you have a confirmed start date, schedule a meeting with your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This should be face-to-face or via a video call, not through email or text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### What to Say
Keep your resignation message short, sweet, and to the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Provide the minimum necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Example**: "I just want to let you know that I've got another opportunity that came my way, and it's really the best move for my family. I just wanted to thank you for all the time, but I am giving my two weeks' notice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   **Avoid**: Do not elaborate on negative reasons for leaving, such as having a "bad boss" or disliking the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This can create an emotional and potentially volatile situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### No Counter-Offers
Go into the conversation with a firm decision to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Do not entertain [[strategies_for_job_resignation_and_counter_offers | counter offers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Your goal is to cut ties cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Be professional, take the high road, and express courtesy and thanks for the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Notifying Colleagues and Clients

After informing your boss, ask them for their opinion on when and how to inform your team, co-workers, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. You want to follow proper protocol to leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Consider the Impact
Recognize that your departure will create a void and increase the workload for your colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Be graceful and appreciative when speaking to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Personal Thank Yous and Networking
*   Directly contact people who were instrumental in your career (e.g., trainers, mentors) to give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   Ask them to join your professional network (e.g., LinkedIn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Building and maintaining this network is vital for future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## [[importance_of_giving_notice_when_resigning | The Two Weeks' Notice]]

Always give at least two weeks' notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While there's no legal requirement, it allows you to:
*   Tie up loose ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   Help transition your work to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Show consideration for your co-workers, who will have to pick up your responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   Ensure customers are properly supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Final Day Etiquette

### Positive Parting Message
On your last day, if possible, gather your local team for a brief huddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Keep your reasons for leaving high-level and generic, focusing on a "better opportunity" or it being "better for your family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Focus on Positives**: Emphasize positive aspects like enjoying working with the team, appreciating the opportunity to grow your career, and thanking everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Avoid Trashing**: Do not trash the company, the job, or your boss as you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This burns bridges and can leave you without options if your new opportunity doesn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Leaving the Door Open
Consider asking your boss if you could be considered to return to the organization in the future if things don't work out at your new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Maintaining good terms with former bosses is also vital for future references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Your employment brand, how you treat people when you leave, will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Aim to leave on good terms and create a great impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

When considering how to [[tips_for_quitting_a_job | quit your job]], it's important to do so in the most proper and graceful way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. As a corporate recruiter and HR professional with over 20 years of experience, a strategic approach to leaving an organization can significantly impact your future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Why Quit Gracefully?

Whether you are leaving for a promotional opportunity, to further your career, or to escape a bad situation, the rules for quitting remain the same: leave with grace and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Avoid Burning Bridges
Quitting your job spectacularly by storming out, kicking your computer over, or telling colleagues to "take this job and shove it" is the wrong approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. This behavior will likely lead to:
*   Ineligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>.
*   Burning bridges not just with the employer, but also with professional contacts and even good work friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   A reputation as a "loose cannon" or risk, which can prevent future job referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   Potential legal consequences in extreme cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

The satisfaction of a dramatic exit is fleeting, while the negative impact on your employment brand can be lifelong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Steps Before Announcing Your Departure

### Secure a New Opportunity
It's easier to find a job when you already have one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Therefore, do not tell anyone you are looking to leave until you have another opportunity lined up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Telling your current boss too soon could lead to an earlier-than-anticipated departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

### Have All Your Ducks in a Row
Before giving notice, ensure all conditions for your new job offer are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Completed drug screens with results back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   Successful background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   References checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   A confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Avoid Premature Notice
> There have been cases where a job offer was rescinded due to an issue with a background check *after* the candidate had already given notice to their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Waiting for a confirmed "green light" from your new company is a safe [[preparing_for_a_job_transition | transition]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

### Maintain Discretion
Keep your job search and new opportunity a secret, even from close work friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Rumors can spread, and if something falls through with the new offer, you could find yourself in a difficult position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Announcing Your Departure

### Inform Your Boss First
The first person to know you're leaving should be your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Method**: Schedule a face-to-face meeting or a video call if remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Avoid sending an email or text message for this sensitive conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **What to Say**: Keep your message short, sweet, and to the point. Focus on the positive aspects of your new opportunity, such as it being "the best move for my family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **What to Avoid**: Do not elaborate on negative reasons for leaving (e.g., "you're a bad boss" or "I hated the job") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This can create a volatile situation and is unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Your decision should already be made, and there's no satisfaction in burning bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Give Two Weeks' Notice
Always give two weeks' notice as a professional courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. While not legally required, it allows you to tie up loose ends and, more importantly, is a courtesy to your coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Coworkers**: Your departure creates a void, and your coworkers will have increased workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. A two-week notice period allows for a smoother [[preparing_for_a_job_transition | transition plan]] and minimizes disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. It's about not "screwing over" the people you worked with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

### Inform Coworkers and Clients (with Approval)
After informing your boss, ask for their opinion on when it's appropriate to inform your team, coworkers, clients, or internal customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Wait for their green light to ensure you follow proper protocol and leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

## Exiting Gracefully

### Show Appreciation and Build Your Network
On your last day, or in the days leading up to it, express appreciation to those who were instrumental in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Thank You**: Call or contact people who trained you, offered guidance, or gave you opportunities, and give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **Networking**: Ask these individuals to join your personal network, especially on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Building strong professional networks is one of the most powerful ways to find future job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### Maintain a Positive Outlook
When [[discussing_reasons_for_leaving_current_job | discussing reasons for leaving current job]] with coworkers, keep it positive and generic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Focus on the positive aspects, such as:
*   Having a better opportunity for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
*   Enjoying working with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   Appreciating the opportunity for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

Do not trash the company, the job, or your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This keeps working relationships intact.

### Keep the Door Open
Always aim to leave on good terms and with a great impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   **Rehire Consideration**: You might even ask your current boss if there's an opportunity to be considered for rehire if things don't work out at your new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Future References**: Maintaining good terms with former bosses is crucial, as they will likely serve as references for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

Your [[tips_for_quitting_a_job | employment brand]] reflects how you treat people, especially when leaving an organization, and this will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. Always choose the high road and be professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

When considering a new job offer, it is crucial to pay close attention to signs of [[identifying_high_turnover_as_a_red_flag | high turnover]] within a department or the broader company, as this can be a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[01:41]</a>.

## Signs of Departmental Turnover
A key indicator to look for is if there appears to be a high turnover rate in the department you are joining, or even within the company as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43">[01:43]</a>. This includes situations where the manager you would report to is in the process of leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46">[01:46]</a>.

Instances have been noted where a manager leaves in the middle of recruiting for a position, requiring recruiters and HR to introduce a new manager to the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49">[01:49]</a>. This can be a major deciding factor for a candidate who was excited about a particular management style or fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>.

### The "Revolving Door"
If a department appears to have a "revolving door" of employees, indicating they cannot retain staff, it warrants a hard question: "Why is that happening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25">[02:25]</a>.

## Investigating Turnover Causes
During the interview process, candidates should actively ask about the reasons for turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32">[02:32]</a>.

### Hiring Manager as a Factor
If the hiring manager themselves is the reason employees are leaving, it is highly probable that you will find yourself updating your resume again within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39">[02:39]</a>.

### Organizational Culture as a Factor
Similarly, if the organizational culture is responsible for employees leaving, this is a significant factor that must be assessed during the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45">[02:45]</a>. Understanding the [[understanding_company_and_department_dynamics | company's dynamics]] and culture is crucial before accepting an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>.

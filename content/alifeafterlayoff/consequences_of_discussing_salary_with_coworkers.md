While advocating for [[understanding_salary_transparency | salary transparency]] at a high level is important, it's generally not recommended to discuss your salary directly with co-workers within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. An HR professional advises extreme caution with disclosing this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Why Not Discuss Salary Internally?

Sharing salary details internally can lead to several negative outcomes:

*   **Employee Dissatisfaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>
    *   When co-workers share their salaries, someone in the group may realize they are underpaid and become upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This can cause an employee to consider quitting or directly confront their boss about compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Management Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>
    *   If co-workers discover [[salary_and_benefits_issues | salary disparities]] and approach management, the boss may lose trust in the employees involved in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Even if there are legitimate reasons for pay differences, such as skill, experience, or changes in the job market, the manager might still view the person who shared their salary as untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Hindered Career Progression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>
    *   A loss of trust from management can prevent you from getting promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Recommended Approach for Salary Transparency

If you wish to contribute to [[understanding_salary_transparency | salary transparency]], it is advised to share your salary anonymously on external platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This allows others to understand fair compensation for roles without risking internal workplace repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

Examples of such platforms include:
*   Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>
*   Comparably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>
*   Team Blind (especially for those in the tech sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>

By sharing anonymously and carefully, you can help others understand market value for roles without experiencing any personal blowback in your current workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

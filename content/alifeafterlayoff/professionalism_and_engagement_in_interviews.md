To successfully navigate the interview process and secure a job, candidates must demonstrate both professionalism and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many reasons exist for interview rejections, including motivational mismatches or lack of experience, but often, it's what a candidate says or doesn't say that leads to being placed in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A corporate recruiter emphasizes that even seemingly innocent statements can result in rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Demonstrating Professionalism

[[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | Maintaining professionalism in the workplace]] begins during the interview process. Keeping communication polished and professional is crucial for making a favorable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Preparation and Research
*   **Do not ask what the company does:** Reaching any stage of the interview process without knowing the company's core business makes a candidate appear unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Recruiters expect candidates to have conducted basic research on the company's products, divisions, competitors, and new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This research demonstrates genuine interest in the company's mission, vision, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Candidates should also look for the company's core value statement to assess cultural alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Do not ask what the role is:** While some detail about the position is expected, candidates should have thoroughly read the job description and understand what the role aims to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Asking about the role indicates a lack of homework and creates a poor first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Companies seek problem-solvers, not individuals who require constant hand-holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Professional Demeanor and Communication
*   **Avoid discussing hours (for salaried positions):** Asking about hours can suggest a candidate is a "clock watcher," which is an undesirable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. If concerns exist about work-life balance, reframe the question to inquire about the company culture, expectations for the first 90 days, or shift support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Be careful when asking about promotional opportunities:** While a career path is a reasonable expectation, directly asking about quickly advancing to a higher position can indicate a lack of interest in the current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Instead, inquire about general career paths and long-term growth opportunities, emphasizing excitement for the current position and a desire to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Do not initiate salary discussions in early stages:** Asking about salary immediately is a turn-off for employers, as the candidate may not fully understand the position yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It is preferable for the recruiter to bring up this topic to avoid questioning the candidate's motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. In later rounds, especially with hiring managers, avoid asking about pay ranges, as HR or the TA team typically handles salary discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Answer salary expectation questions directly:** When asked about salary expectations, candidates should know the desired number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Avoiding the question or asking to defer it shows a lack of preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Do not speak poorly of previous employers or bosses:** Complaining about past experiences or colleagues is unproductive; interviewers are focused on assessing fit for their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Candidates should instead be gracious, discuss lessons learned, and demonstrate genuine interest in the current opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Avoid being overly nervous:** While some nervousness is expected, especially if unemployed, candidates should eventually take ownership of the interview and project confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Overly nervous behavior can be detrimental, particularly in hiring manager interviews where there is less tolerance for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. [[preparing_for_job_interviews | Preparing for job interviews]] thoroughly helps manage nerves and allows candidates to sell themselves effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Do not be too casual:** While a relaxed demeanor can break the ice, excessive casualness or "colorful language" can be offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Treat the interview as a professional setting, not a social one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Err on the side of caution with first names, and never use derogatory terms like "boss" or "bro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Asking Thoughtful Questions
*   **Always ask questions:** Not asking questions at the end of an interview signals a lack of interest or awareness about fitting into the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Candidates should come prepared with a list of well-thought-out, intelligent questions about the company, its culture, and how they might contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Showing engagement in the process is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Candidates who are serious about getting the job should prioritize [[preparing_for_interviews effectively | effective interview preparation]] to stay ahead of the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Developing [[interview_skills_and_selfpresentation | strong interview skills and self-presentation]] means understanding how to sell oneself effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

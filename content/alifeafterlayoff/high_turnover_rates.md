When evaluating potential employers, one significant warning sign to look out for is [[employee_turnover_and_company_stability | high employee turnover rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. A poor quality employer typically struggles to retain good employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Identifying High Turnover Rates

To [[assessing_company_turnover_rates | assess company turnover rates]], job seekers should ask specific questions during interviews and conduct external research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Interview Questions

A simple way to spot [[signs_of_high_turnover_and_its_implications | high turnover]] is to ask why the position is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. If the interviewer cannot provide a valid reason, or if they admit previous employees were terminated or left voluntarily, they must explain the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### External Resources

It's crucial to cross-reference information with Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. While reviews can be biased (people often post when upset), look for common threads in the Glassdoor reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, if multiple reviews consistently mention micromanagement or unfulfilled bonuses, this indicates a cultural issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Reasons for High Turnover

High turnover can stem from several underlying issues within an organization:

*   **Reputation for Layoffs/Firings**
    If a company is known for [[current_trends_and_causes_of_layoffs | laying people off]] or firing employees suddenly, it's a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Poor Work Culture**
    Employees leaving on their own accord due to a poor work culture is a clear red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Subpar Compensation**
    [[Voluntary turnover and its impact on organizations | Voluntary turnover]] can also occur if the pay is consistently subpar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

By reading between the lines and asking the right questions, job seekers can identify and avoid poor quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Job seekers should be wary of employers with high turnover rates, as this is a significant red flag during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Poor quality employers often struggle to retain good employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Being stuck with a bad employer can set back a career by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Identifying High Turnover Rates

When [[evaluating_company_turnover_rates | evaluating company turnover rates]], there are several key indicators and strategies to employ:

### Ask Direct Questions
A simple way to spot high turnover is by asking the interviewer why the position is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. If the employer cannot provide a valid reason, or admits that previous occupants were terminated or left on their own accord, they should explain the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This directly relates to [[reasons_for_employee_layoffs | reasons for employee layoffs]] and [[voluntary_turnover_and_its_impact | voluntary turnover]].

### Utilize Glassdoor for Research
Glassdoor is a valuable resource for cross-referencing company information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. While reviews on Glassdoor often come from upset individuals and should be taken with a grain of salt, job seekers should look for common threads throughout the reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, if multiple reviews consistently mention micromanagement or unfulfilled bonuses, this indicates a potential cultural issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This research is part of [[evaluating_company_reputation_and_turnover_rates | evaluating company reputation and turnover rates]].

### Observe Company Reputation
Consider if a company has a reputation for suddenly laying off or firing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Similarly, if employees frequently leave due to poor work culture or subpar pay, this is another warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. It is crucial to read between the lines of what is said and what is implied by a company's history and online reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is important to approach your job search with strategy to avoid accepting subpar positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Solid employees should be very selective about the roles they take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

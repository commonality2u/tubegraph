Staying with the same employer for an extended period, particularly more than two years, can lead to [[role_of_wage_growth_and_economic_factors | wage stagnation]] and cause the market to pass an individual by in terms of both career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon occurs even if an employee is satisfied in their current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## How Wage Stagnation Occurs

Companies often adopt different pay philosophies, categorized as "pay leaders" or "pay laggards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Pay leaders proactively retain talent by offering competitive wages, while pay laggards may build turnover into their business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

A primary cause of [[role_of_wage_growth_and_economic_factors | wage stagnation]] is the difference between internal pay raises and external market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. While internal promotions might yield a 5-10% raise every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, the external market for new talent often sees increases of 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. This means a new hire with similar experience might earn the same or more than a long-term employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

Furthermore, annual cost-of-living adjustments (typically 1-3%) often fail to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. In an economy with significant inflation (e.g., 7% last year), not receiving a raise equivalent to inflation means a real decrease in earning power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

> [!info] Employer Behavior
> Employers might underpay employees significantly, sometimes 20-30% below market rate, especially if employees do not complain or test the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Recruiters often discover internal pay equity issues when assessing salaries for external candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Companies may only address pay discrepancies when faced with mass turnover or when an employee tenders their resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Stagnation

If an individual's salary growth is limited to small incremental adjustments without promotions or market checks, they can find themselves significantly underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Falling too far behind market rates can make it nearly impossible to catch up unless the current company implements a major salary adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

> [!example] Anecdotal Case
> A top performer in the medical field, who had been with her employer for 7-8 years, was relatively happy but worked in a department with nearly 100% turnover in 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. After receiving an external job offer for $5 more an hour, she informed her employer of her intent to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Her current employer countered with a $15 an hour raise to retain her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This suggests she was drastically underpaid to begin with, or the company was trying to retain top talent in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Despite the immediate benefit of such a counteroffer, accepting it can have long-term implications, as companies might see it as a forced retention rather than a proper valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Combat Wage Stagnation

To avoid [[role_of_wage_growth_and_economic_factors | wage stagnation]], individuals should proactively engage with the job market, even if content in their current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

*   **Regular Market Checks:** It is recommended to test the open market at least once every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This involves:
    *   Submitting applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
    *   Connecting with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
    *   Monitoring market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
    *   Going through interview processes to understand required skills and assessment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Salary Discussions:** Reaching the offer stage allows individuals to gauge if they are underpaid relative to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. While not every small offer should be leveraged for a counteroffer, understanding market trends is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Networking:** Many significant opportunities come through active and targeted networking rather than just applying for jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. Building a strong network, especially on platforms like LinkedIn, can help attract recruiters and bypass traditional application gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

In the current volatile job market, staying informed about market changes is more important than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Proactive engagement ensures individuals are not left behind and are valued appropriately for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

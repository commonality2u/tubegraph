When interviewing for a job, certain signs can indicate that a hiring team is particularly interested in you and may be looking to **fasttrack** your application through the hiring process. This means they are actively working to expedite your progress towards a job offer, often due to your strong fit for the role and their desire to secure you quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Signs You're Being Fasttracked

### 1. The Recruiter Keeps You "Warm"

A strong positive sign is when the recruiter or company consistently keeps you informed about the progress of your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This practice, known as [[keeping_candidates_engaged | keeping a candidate warm]], usually means the hiring manager has asked the recruiter to maintain communication with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This often occurs when the team needs to conclude interviews with other candidates, handle internal loose ends, or wait for key decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The goal is to keep you [[keeping_candidates_engaged | engaged]], excited about the role, and feeling positive about the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Conversely, if there are long periods of silence and you are kept in the dark, it may indicate you are not considered a top candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### 2. They Ask About Other Interviews

Another significant indicator of strong interest is when the recruiter asks if you are actively interviewing with other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This is not a [[trap_interview_questions | trick question]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Recruiters ask this to gauge how aggressively they need to move you through their [[improving_recruitment_processes | recruitment process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If you have other interviews or an offer, it signals to the recruiter that they need to accelerate the process, potentially by moving schedules or even skipping an interview step, to ensure they don't lose you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 3. Immediate Scheduling of Next Steps

If, upon concluding an interview, the next interview is immediately scheduled, either on the same call or by the recruiter shortly after, it's a very strong sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This indicates that the team has clearly identified you as a strong candidate and is fasttracking you through the remaining stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. If they are making efforts to get you an audience with a senior leader, it's an exceptionally positive sign that they see you as a solid candidate likely to receive an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Delays in scheduling, on the other hand, can suggest you are a mid-tier candidate or the role is not a high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### 4. Reconfirming Interest and Salary Expectations

After interviews conclude, if the recruiter calls you to reconfirm your interest in the role and your salary expectations, it's a strong indicator that an offer is being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This often means the hiring manager has instructed them to confirm your situation and ensure that a potential offer will be well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. When asked to reconfirm salary, it is important to be realistic and consistent with previous discussions to avoid raising red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### 5. Direct Call from the Hiring Manager

A highly positive sign is when the hiring manager calls you directly, rather than the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Recruiters often suggest this to hiring managers for preferred candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This direct call serves as a "pre-sale" or "pre-close," where the manager aims to reconfirm your interest, answer any lingering questions, and address potential objections to the job early in the [[improving_job_offer_processes | offer process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This proactive approach by the hiring manager signifies a strong desire to secure you quickly and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

These signs can help alleviate some anxiety during the stressful interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you've been invited to an interview, it means the company already sees potential in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

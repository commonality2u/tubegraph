LinkedIn is extensively used by corporate recruiters to source and find candidates, often filling positions without open job posts due to the untargeted nature of such applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Recruiters prefer LinkedIn because it allows them to narrow down searches and find perfect matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, which is more efficient than sifting through hundreds of applications from a job posting, where only a few might be suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## How Recruiters Use Keywords

Recruiters use a separate LinkedIn platform called "LinkedIn Recruiter" which functions as a back-channel database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Anything you put into your LinkedIn profile can be searched for using keywords or specific filtering levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

This powerful feature allows recruiters to perform "Boolean searches," which are advanced search strategies using strings of keywords to find very specific combinations of skill sets and targeted profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This saves a lot of time by quickly identifying exact fits among thousands of profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Optimizing Your Profile with Keywords

To ensure your profile appears in recruiter search results, it's crucial to load your LinkedIn profile with relevant keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. If your profile lacks these specific keywords, you will not show up in searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Identifying Relevant Keywords
The keywords you should add depend on your industry and the types of positions currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It is advisable to:
*   **Keep a pulse on your industry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Identify major skills** that people in your industry commonly possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Add any relevant skills you have** to your LinkedIn profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

The more keywords you incorporate, the easier it will be for recruiters to find you, increasing your chances of being contacted for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

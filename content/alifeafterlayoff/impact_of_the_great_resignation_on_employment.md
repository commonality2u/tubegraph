Quiet quitting is a new concept gaining traction in the workforce that is considered an extension of [[the_great_resignation | The Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is described as effectively quitting your job without actually leaving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This phenomenon involves reducing one's output to the minimum acceptable standard for a job, doing just enough to get by, and refusing to take on additional tasks or burdens beyond the basic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The goal is to relieve oneself of stress by doing the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

This concept is a legitimate phenomenon, as highlighted in a Business Insider article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## The Rise of Coasting Culture

The shift towards quiet quitting is part of a broader "coasting culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. During the pandemic, many professionals began to view work simply as a source of a paycheck to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Several factors contributed to the ideal conditions for this new resolve:
*   A hot labor market has ensured job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   The rise in remote work made it more challenging for managers to monitor employee effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Employees engaging in quiet quitting see it as a considered, deliberate decision to stop letting companies extract "free labor" from them, after years of feeling exploited through late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This represents a secret resistance against the previous "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Historical Employment Dynamics

Historically, the employment market pendulum was heavily skewed towards employers, who demanded excessive effort from employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This led to a "hustle culture" where individuals felt compelled to work long hours, take on extra tasks, and be constantly available, often at the expense of their personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Companies have also followed a repeating cycle: starting lean, becoming bloated, then undergoing catastrophic events (like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11) that lead to mass layoffs, and then becoming leaner again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. In the decade leading up to 2020, companies experienced an extended growth period, becoming increasingly bloated and looking for reasons to "cut the fat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## The Pandemic's [[Impact of economic changes on employment opportunities | Impact on Employment]]

When the pandemic hit in 2020, it provided an "opportune time" for companies to make "ruthless cuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. However, many companies cut "too big, too deep," which fractured the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This marked a significant shift towards the employee's favor, a change not seen since the 1930s with the Fair Labor Standards Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Companies that made severe cuts soon found the market shifting back, with demand "screaming back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Employees who had participated in the hustle culture and lost personal time felt a deep sense of betrayal after being laid off or witnessing mass cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This led them to re-evaluate their priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This period is seen as a "seismic shift in the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Employee Re-evaluation and Changing Dynamics

Employees are now re-evaluating the value of the hustle culture and the sacrifices they made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. A generational component is also at play, with Baby Boomers exiting the workforce and Generation Z entering with a "completely different" mentality towards work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Companies are now being forced to re-evaluate their approach to the work world and how they treat employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The days of being loyal to a company for 20 years are considered antiquated, and staying too long might even be "looked down upon" in some circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Employees who stay too long may also fall behind on compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The pendulum has swung, and many people have participated in [[the_great_resignation | The Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Quiet quitting is an extension of this, as employees decide they are no longer willing to work long hours but don't want to quit their jobs entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Burnout and Boundaries

During the 2020 layoff period, remaining employees had to pick up the slack when demand returned, leading to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This has prompted many to exit workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Now, employees are no longer willing to be overloaded with work, work long hours, or work weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. They are establishing employment boundaries in their lives, which is seen as a healthy development, as employers previously "behaving badly" got away with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## A New Work Philosophy

For the first time, employees are viewing their jobs solely as a source of income to support themselves and their families, not as a demanding "higher calling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. The philosophy is shifting from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Employees are shedding the expectation that their "company's not my family" and are no longer tolerating the grueling hours they once accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. After decades of "leaning in," many are now choosing to "lean back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Employers are realistically unable to backfill many positions, leading them to accept "some output is better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. While the speaker does not advocate quiet quitting, they suggest that if unhappy, employees should strategically plan their exit or, if quitting isn't an option, adjust their output to the minimum acceptable level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

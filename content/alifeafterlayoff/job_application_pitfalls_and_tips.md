This article shares insights from a recruiter's perspective on common pitfalls in the [[job_hunting_and_interview_tips | job application]] and interview process, along with tips to improve your chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The State of Job Applications
Most job applications received by recruiters are considered "total garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Often, hundreds of candidates apply quickly, but very few are well-qualified or will receive a phone call for a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Many applicants tend to apply for jobs they are "hopelessly underqualified for," making a vast majority of inbound applications a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

Only about 5% of inbound applications are typically qualified enough to excite a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Recruiters usually expect to find candidates through active sourcing rather than inbound applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Resume and First Impressions
Your resume serves as your best, and likely only, first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Recruiters generally screen a resume within about five seconds, quickly deciding whether to place it in the "yes" or "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Once this initial impression is made, it's difficult to change their mind, and revising an application after it's been dispositioned won't typically lead to a phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Tips for Resume Success
*   A good resume that is a close fit for the role is a pleasant surprise for recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   If you are a good fit and have a really solid resume, you have a higher chance of getting noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   Make your first impression count with a subtle, solid resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Interview Skills
The best person "on paper" doesn't always get hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Instead, it often comes down to who best sells themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Having strong [[job_interview_strategies_and_tips | interview skills]] can convince a hiring team that you are the better fit, even if someone else appears more qualified on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

Finely tuned [[job_interview_strategies and tips | interviewing skills]] are crucial and can literally "pay" off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. What you need to emphasize in an interview changes based on the round (e.g., recruiter, hiring manager, panel interview) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Building rapport and getting the interview team to like you significantly increases your chances of getting through the process and receiving an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Recruiter's Quick Assessment
Recruiters generally know within the first 10 minutes, often by the second or third question, whether a candidate is a good fit and will be moved to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Making a great first impression early in the interview process is crucial, as it helps recruiters confidently place you in the "yes" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. While it's not impossible to recover, floundering at the beginning makes it harder to play catch-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

### Asking Questions
At the end of the interview, the recruiter has typically already made up their mind about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. If you're asking questions to try and impress the interview team to get into the "yes" pile, it's generally too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. However, asking questions to clarify your interest in the company is a different matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

<p class="callout callout-note">
[!NOTE]
It is advised to ask great questions, but try to ask them earlier in the interview process to position yourself as the best possible fit, rather than at the end when the decision is often already made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Salary Expectations
The question about salary expectations is not a trick question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Recruiters genuinely want to understand your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Candidates should do their due diligence and know how to answer this question confidently before the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

## Behind-the-Scenes Decisions and Delays
Recruiters often advocate for candidates they like to hiring managers, but the manager can still eliminate a candidate at that stage, sometimes due to arbitrary biases or preconceived notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Therefore, a rejection doesn't always mean the recruiter didn't submit you or that you weren't considered by the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

Long delays in getting feedback are frequently due to unresponsive hiring managers, not the recruiter's fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Recruiters are just as frustrated by these delays because they are graded on how quickly they fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

A long delay after interviews is generally not a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. It often means they are interviewing other candidates or are undecided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### The "Home Run" Hire
If a candidate is considered a "home run hire," the hiring manager will act quickly to make an offer, often on the same day as the first interview, to avoid losing them to another employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Long delays indicate that the hiring team is not convinced you are the best fit and may be exploring other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

For "home run" candidates, hiring managers will find ways to meet salary expectations, even if they are above the initial range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This can involve combining multiple jobs into one headcount or increasing equity stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. It's up to the candidate to convince them they are an "absolute Grand Slam hire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

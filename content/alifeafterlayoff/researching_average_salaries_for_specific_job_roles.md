The question "What's your salary expectation?" is a common and often dreaded part of the job interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Answering incorrectly or refusing to answer can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Understanding how to approach [[salary_expectations_and_negotiations | salary expectations]] is crucial for both job seekers and employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters typically ask about salary expectations to determine if a candidate's needs align with the company's established [[understanding_salary_bands_and_market_wage_surveys | salary bands]] for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This ensures that if an offer is extended, the candidate is likely to accept and be excited about the compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. An unsatisfied employee, who accepts a salary below their expectation, is likely to remain open to other opportunities, leading to potential re-hiring costs for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Handling Salary Discrepancies

### When Your Expectation is Higher
If your salary expectation is higher than the company's range, you might be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, there's often room for negotiation if the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000 apart) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. A recruiter might gauge your flexibility or suggest alternative compensation structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

For "superstar" candidates, recruiters might still forward the resume to the hiring manager with the higher expectation, suggesting the role could be "enriched" (e.g., made a Level 2 or 3 position) to justify a higher [[understanding_job_expectations_and_compensation | compensation]] range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It's crucial to be honest about your expectations, as a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### When Your Expectation is Lower
If your stated salary expectation is lower than the company's band, it's often good news. Major corporations have [[understanding_salary_bands_and_market_wage_surveys | salary bands]] based on local market wage surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> and internal equity, which ensures fair compensation for similar roles within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If your expectation falls below the minimum of the range, you will likely be automatically jumped up to that lowest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This scenario is common for candidates coming from smaller companies or less reputable employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Refusing to Answer
Refusing to give a salary expectation, or being vague, will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Recruiters need to know if a deal can be made before investing further time in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Ambiguity can also suggest you are hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Essential Information for Answering the Question

To effectively answer the salary expectation question, you need to know three key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>:

1.  **Average Salary Range for the Role in the Open Market**: This requires research into what similar roles pay in your local area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **What the Company is Expecting to Pay**: While not always publicly available, some companies may indicate this or the recruiter might provide hints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom Line Salary Expectation**: This is the absolute minimum you would accept to walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. While you don't necessarily share this number with the recruiter, you need to know it for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Researching Average Salaries

To find the average salary for a role, conduct thorough research:
*   **Google Search**: Start with a broad search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Salary Websites**: Utilize resources like Glassdoor or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Recent Job Postings**: Look at other recently posted similar roles to see what they are paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Local Market Focus**: Ensure your research focuses on jobs in your local area, as salary ranges can vary significantly by region (e.g., Alabama vs. Bay Area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Strategies for Answering the Salary Question

Once you have your research, you can choose from a few approaches:

1.  **Directly State Your Expectation**: If you are confident in your worth and believe your expectation aligns with the company's range, simply provide your actual number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Be prepared to work with this number throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
2.  **Frame with Market Research**: If you are concerned about a lowball offer or being too high, use your research to frame your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    > "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110 thousand. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    This puts the onus on the company to disclose their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Put the Question Back on the Recruiter**: If you are willing to take a potentially lower salary or are unsure of the company's range, try to get them to reveal their target first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    > "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
    Be prepared for the recruiter to push back and still have an answer ready, but do not avoid the question altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Ambiguity can lead to annoyance from the hiring manager and may result in rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Navigating [[navigating_questions_about_career_plans_and_salary | salary questions]] effectively is a crucial step in the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. By doing your research and having a prepared answer, you increase your chances of securing the job and [[salary_negotiations_and_market_surveys | negotiating a fair salary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Reasons for Workplace Issues

Employers cite a variety of reasons for the difficulties encountered with recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Common Performance Issues
The most frequently cited reasons for new hires not working out include:
*   Lack of motivation or initiative (50% of employers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Lack of professionalism (nearly 46%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Lacking organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   Lack of relevant work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This is seen as a disconnect given that entry-level positions often require years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Poor problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

*   Difficulty working in a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Perceived Attitudes and Behaviors
Hiring managers also hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:
*   **Entitlement:** 65-70% believe they are entitled, often trying to get promoted too quickly without demonstrated skill or experience, and expecting high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Sensitivity:** 65% believe they get offended easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Work Ethic:** Perceived lack of work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Unpreparedness:** Unprepared for the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Training Costs:** They are perceived as costing more to train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Technological Skills:** Surprisingly, 28% reported a lack of technological skills, despite Gen Z growing up with modern devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Unprofessional Conduct
Specific unprofessional behaviors observed include:
*   Difficulty managing workload (1 in 5) and being unprofessional (1 in 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Frequent tardiness (20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Not dressing professionally (20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Using inappropriate language (19%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

These issues suggest a disconnect between university preparation and the demands of the working world, with a clear lack of transition training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Impact of Social Media
Employers are also concerned about the use of social media:
*   **Constant Phone Use:** Many Gen Z workers struggle to separate themselves from their phones, leading to constant use during work hours, short attention spans, and an inability to focus for more than 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Professional Boundaries:** A perceived lack of separation between personal and professional life on social media, with individuals posting about slacking off at work without considering employer visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Political Topics:** Avoiding political discussions in the workplace is also emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Consequences and Future Outlook

The challenges have led some employers to consider drastic measures:
*   One in seven companies may decide not to hire any college graduates in 2025, which represents a significant number when extrapolated across all employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   A stronger work ethic and better attitude are identified as key factors that would make college graduates more hirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by Gen Z Themselves

It is noted that Gen Z entered the workforce during [[challenges_in_todays_job_market | one of the most difficult job markets ever]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Many are forced to apply to thousands of positions just to begin their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Despite the negative perceptions, there are many motivated and driven Gen Z employees who are strategic and aiming for strong careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

This generation is also driving positive changes, such as emphasizing [[worklife_balance_challenges_for_new_graduates | work-life balance]], which is seen as a welcome development in an increasingly unhealthy workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

*   Maintain work-appropriate social media presence, as employers often check online profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

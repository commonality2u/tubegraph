Human Resources (HR) departments often face criticism, and sometimes their actions contribute to this negative perception. While HR can be an ally at lower organizational levels, some practices are considered shady and may not align with employee best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These practices, often carried out by both HR and talent acquisition, are designed primarily to limit company liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Obsession with Documentation
HR departments are "utterly obsessed" with documenting every aspect of the employment arrangement, from application to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Employment applications and disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Offer letters and their terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Orientation training and policy reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Employee handbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   Documented coaching sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Exit documents, particularly severance packages with terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

All these documents, often requiring employee signatures, are collected into an employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Their primary purpose is to limit the company's liability and potentially build a case against the employee if needed to defend a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Confidential Job Postings
Confidential job postings, where the company name is blanked out, are a common [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | recruitment practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The most common reason for this is that the company is actively replacing the person currently in that role without their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This practice allows the company to get a head start on replacing an employee, ensuring they have someone ready to step in once they decide to terminate the current employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For job seekers, encountering such postings should raise a red flag, as a company engaging in this practice might do the same to them in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Attempting to Pay Less Than Deserved
HR departments often try to pay new hires less than they deserve, using "process and policy" as justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. They aim to secure talent at the lowest possible cost, especially if the candidate is not proficient in [[salary_negotiation_tactics_by_hr | salary negotiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Common tactics include:
*   Insisting on fitting candidates into "narrow and often rigid salary bands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
*   Using "internal equity" as an excuse for not meeting salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   Offering a lower initial salary with vague promises of future revisions or raises, which often do not materialize unless explicitly stated in the offer letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

HR may also use salary bands to deny appropriate raises or promotions, leading to "promotion in name only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. However, when a "rockstar candidate" demands a higher salary or a critical employee tenders their resignation, HR often finds ways to make exceptions, demonstrating their flexibility when it suits the company's immediate needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Turning Complaints Against Employees
When an employee lodges a complaint about another employee, their boss, or workplace conditions, they often find themselves "put on a list" or gaining a negative reputation, essentially putting a "target on their back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. While HR might assure the employee they will look into the matter, their first stop is often the boss's office to discuss the complainant's performance and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Often, the complainant is then "deemed the troublemaker," leading HR to focus on limiting the company's liability by trying to "remove what they consider to be the root problem"â€”which is frequently the person who lodged the complaint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Lying About Layoffs
HR departments frequently lie about impending [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | layoffs]], telling employees "anything you want to hear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. If HR formally states that layoffs are not being considered, it often means they are actively being planned at that very moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Meetings with employees to discuss their work may begin behind the scenes as part of the layoff preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Using Self-Rankings Against Employees
Before [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | layoffs]], HR may ask employees to rank their own performance and skill sets, often under the guise of "getting a better understanding of our workforce" or "how we can allocate resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. However, this information is often used to assess whether an employee's skills align with the company's long-term vision, and it can be used to determine who ends up on the layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Simultaneously, HR is often meeting with managers and reviewing performance metrics to make these decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. If asked to self-rank, employees should be cautious and consider updating their resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Poor Handling of Layoffs
HR departments have been widely criticized for their poor handling of [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | layoffs]] and terminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Despite public backlash, common poor practices persist, including:
*   Laying off people via Zoom calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
*   Shutting off access to equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>
*   Notifying employees by simply cutting off building access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>

These methods are widely seen as lacking dignity and humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. HR leaders are encouraged to improve these practices and push back against leadership teams that do not prioritize treating people with respect during difficult career transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

Getting a job in the current market can seem impossible, with employer requirements often feeling out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This sentiment is not uncommon and is supported by the existence of "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These hidden demands contribute significantly to the [[challenges_in_todays_job_market | challenges in today's job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, making job postings appear "absolutely ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## What are Hidden Job Requirements?
Hidden job requirements are internal selection guidelines that hiring authorities (usually hiring managers) provide to recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These guidelines are distinct from the publicly advertised job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Recruiters and hiring managers sit down to define "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications), as well as specific preferences or exclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. While "must-haves" are often realistic (e.g., core experience in software development for a software developer role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, the "preferred" category can reveal hiring manager bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Although a good recruiter should challenge unrealistic demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, this often doesn't happen, especially with junior recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### An Example of Extreme Hidden Requirements
An accidental email from a recruiter revealed a detailed internal memo for a software development role, illustrating extreme hidden requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:

#### What the Company Was Looking For:
*   **Education**: University graduate with a Bachelor's or Master's in Computer Science from a "top program" (e.g., MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, University of Waterloo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Special exceptions for 4.0 graduates from other schools were possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Experience**: 4 to 10 years of software development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Less than four years, even for a "genius," would result in rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Technical Skills**: Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS) and sometimes modern tech like Kotlin, AI, and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Role**: Must show 2+ years in each role, making "job hoppers" a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Those who lost jobs due to company closures or layoffs were not considered a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Startup Experience**: Significant experience in notable startups, especially those backed by Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Citizenship**: US citizen, US permanent resident, green card holder, or Canadian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. No visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Bonus**: Diversity hires (e.g., Black, female) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> and founding engineer/founder experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

#### What the Company Wanted to Avoid:
*   **Visa Candidates**: No visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Career Contractors**: Candidates with a background solely in contract work were not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Job Hoppers**: Frequent, short stints in roles were a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Coding Boot Camp Graduates**: Graduates from coding boot camps like Full Stack Academy or Hacked Reactor were explicitly avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Consulting Background**: Those who worked for IT software development firms instead of product-producing companies were not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Big Company Experience Only**: Candidates with experience limited to large companies like Uber or Intel were rejected unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This was crucial; "big company" experience alone was never considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Fake Profiles**: Recruiters were instructed to screen properly for fake scam profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, which have increased with AI and mass application tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Blacklisted Companies**: Candidates who had ever worked at companies like Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell were "scarlet-lettered" and would "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers
This extreme example, while perhaps a "one-off" in its specifics, highlights how many companies recruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. They often have hidden requirements that are not listed on public job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This creates significant [[issues_with_the_current_job_market_and_hiring_practices | issues with the current job market and hiring practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Job seekers' frustration with such requirements is justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. These unrealistic wish lists make it incredibly difficult for recruiters to find qualified candidates, and often such positions remain open indefinitely because no one can meet the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Strategies for Job Seekers
Given these [[challenges_job_seekers_face_today | challenges job seekers face today]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, here are some [[strategies_for_job_seekers_in_the_current_tech_job_market | strategies for job seekers in the current tech job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **Don't Internalize**: If you're frustrated, remember "it's them and not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Some hiring managers are simply unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Optimize Your Presentation**: Present your resume as cleanly and directly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Targeted Networking**: Engage in targeted networking to find opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Showcase Your Work**: If applicable to your field (e.g., tech), maintain a GitHub profile or create a portfolio/simple website to demonstrate your skills and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Avoid Unrealistic Employers**: Do not lose sleep over jobs with ridiculous requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. It's often better to move on to the next opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control**: By not applying to jobs with absurd criteria, job seekers can encourage companies to adjust their hiring approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The best defense is not subjecting yourself to these types of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Reclaiming control in your career is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Seek out resources and guidance from insider perspectives to navigate these [[challenges_in_the_job_market | challenges in the job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

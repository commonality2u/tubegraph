Many individuals experience setbacks in their professional journeys due to a lack of strategic planning. Brian, the speaker, emphasizes that taking ownership of one's career and acting like its [[importance_of_proactive_career_management | CEO]] is crucial for advancement and satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. By analyzing personal experiences, he aims to encourage others to look at their careers more analytically and make necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## A Story of Stagnation: The "18-Month" Promise
Early in his career, Brian was recruited into a small railroad services company with approximately 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His role as Staffing and Development Manager evolved into a Human Resources Manager position, providing valuable experience and allowing him to significantly impact the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

The premise for Brian accepting this role was a clear succession plan: he was to learn from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was scheduled to retire in 18 months, after which Brian would be promoted to run the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The company fostered a family-oriented atmosphere, and Brian enjoyed a high degree of freedom in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

However, the promised retirement never materialized. The VP, along with other senior leaders due to retire, held onto their positions, reluctant to give up their "kingdoms" and significant bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Brian's boss repeatedly told him he wasn't ready, offering no real development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## The Cost of Apathy: Falling Behind Peers
Brian was part of a leadership development group, but peers who took [[importance_of_proactive_career_management | ownership]] of their careers started leaving the organization when promotions didn't occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. One peer even became president of a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Brian, however, chose to bide his time, comfortable with his steady job and good standing within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

This comfort led to apathy. The promised 18 months stretched into nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. By the time Brian left the HR role for another internal position (driven by a different senior leader recognizing his talent in marketing and creative areas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, he had given up on his initial dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. His former boss eventually retired two years after Brian left, but continued to hover over his replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Key Consequences of Lacking a Career Plan:
*   **Apathy and Comfort:** Brian became comfortable collecting a steady paycheck and didn't push for advancement or development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. He stopped making decisions that were in his long-term career interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Loss of Passion and Drive:** He lost interest in going above and beyond or volunteering for new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Stagnant Skill Set:** He failed to keep up with industry trends, technology, and buzzwords, falling behind his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Career Regressio**n: When re-entering the job market, he discovered he was behind in skills, knowledge, and compensation compared to his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. He had to take a step down in responsibility to gain relevant recruiting experience at larger companies, a period when his peers were moving into senior director roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Significant Financial Loss:** The lack of progression and outdated compensation resulted in thousands of dollars in lost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Playing Chess, Not Checkers, with Your Career
Brian reflects that his biggest mistake was not having a clear [[importance_of_having_a_career_plan | plan]] or [[importance_of_career_strategy_and_side_hustles | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. He was "playing checkers" instead of "chess" with his career, waiting for opportunities rather than proactively seeking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. He realized that the "runway" in one's career shortens quickly, especially into mid and later stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

> "If you're just being apathetic, you're letting the work come to you, you're letting the opportunities come to you, you're just kind of waiting around for things to happen, you're wasting your time and you're not acting like the [[importance_of_proactive_career_management | CEO of your career]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Take Ownership of Your Career
The moral of Brian's story is the critical importance of taking your career seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This means:

*   Becoming the [[importance_of_proactive_career_management | CEO of your career]] and taking [[importance_of_proactive_career_management | ownership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   Not waiting for recognition or allowing a company to keep you stuck because you're too good at your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Employment ghosting is defined as an employer or company representative moving a candidate into a formalized interviewing process and then failing to follow up on the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It is considered a poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The speaker, a corporate recruiter, has personally experienced being ghosted after interviewing for positions or being contacted by [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiters]] or hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Reasons for Employment Ghosting (and how best practices can prevent it)

Several factors contribute to ghosting in the hiring process:

### 1. Lazy Recruiting or Recruiters
This is cited as the most common reason for ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Some [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiters]] are too busy or unorganized to follow up and close the loop on interview processes they initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. They may forget or simply not care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### 2. Bad Work Processes and Lack of Internal Control
Companies often struggle with ghosting when they lack internal controls or formalized talent acquisition departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. When human resources personnel, rather than dedicated talent acquisition professionals, manage recruiting, best practices for candidate experience tend to suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Inadequate technology that cannot handle the volume of applicants can also lead to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### 3. Overloaded Recruiters
A professional [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiter]] should ideally manage 15 to 25 requisitions (reqs), depending on the industry and complexity of roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. When organizations assign 40 to 50 reqs, candidate experience inevitably suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. With a typical requirement to submit three interviewable candidates per job, an overloaded [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiter]] could be managing over 200 candidates, making it easy for some to fall through the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### 4. Recruiter Forgetting
When [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiters]] are overloaded, it's possible to genuinely forget to follow up with a candidate, especially without proper tools or processes to track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. While not an excuse, it is a reality in some situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### 5. Hiring Manager Indecisiveness and Delays
Hiring managers can cause perceived ghosting by sitting on candidate profiles for long periods, or requesting additional candidates before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This can delay the hiring process by weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Recruiters often face the challenge of pushing back on wishy-washy hiring managers to disposition candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### 6. Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Jobs can be placed on hold or re-scoped mid-process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Hiring managers sometimes ask [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiters]] to keep candidates "lukewarm" while they look for others, which means they like the candidate but not enough to make an immediate decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. When a requisition is closed, [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiters]] do not always disposition all remaining in-process candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### 7. Hired Another Candidate Without Proper Follow-Up
When a candidate is hired, the [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiter]] may close out the requisition without following up with all other candidates in process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or bad recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Implementing Best Practices to Avoid Ghosting

Forward-thinking organizations prioritize candidate experience as it impacts their overall employment brand and even their bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Example: Amazon's Candidate Experience Initiatives
Amazon is cited as a best-in-class example of candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. They hold their [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiters]] accountable to strict metrics around candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

*   **2-day/5-day Promise:**
    *   If a candidate reaches a hiring manager phone screen, the company promises to respond within two days of the interview's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   If a candidate reaches an on-site loop, they promise to provide [[the_importance_of_recruiter_feedback | feedback]] within five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Forcing Efficiency:** These promises compel hiring teams to be efficient and decisive, which in turn forces [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiters]] to push for quick answers and turnaround times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Customer Impact:** Amazon views job seekers as potential customers. Poor interview experiences, like ghosting, could lead candidates to take their business elsewhere, impacting the company's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The philosophy is to treat candidates as if they are customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Candidate Actions if Ghosted

Unfortunately, if you believe you have been ghosted, there is not much you can do other than sending a polite "nudge" to the [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiter]] to inquire about the status of your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. A simple nudge can prompt the [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | recruiter]] to check and provide a status update or properly close out your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

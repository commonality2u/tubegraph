Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, especially when encountering low-quality employers [00:00:24]. However, employers often provide "tells" or red flags that can indicate a low-quality opportunity [00:00:36]. By paying close attention to specific questions and behaviors, job seekers can discern whether to proceed with an opportunity or walk away [00:00:39].

## Recognizing Red Flags in Interview Questions

Certain questions asked by employers may signal an unfavorable work environment or an employer with ulterior motives [00:00:28]. Being aware of these red flags can help in assessing the quality of an employer and the potential workplace culture [00:01:27].

### Suspicious Questions and What They Indicate

*   **"How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
    *   This question, though seemingly innocent, may indicate an employer's intense focus on attendance, suggesting past issues and potentially an overly particular stance on attendance policies [00:02:15]. It can also imply a lack of workplace flexibility [00:02:36].
    *   **[[Strategies for job interview success | Interview Strategy]]:** If asked, inquire about the employer's expectations regarding unplanned absences. A strict stance might indicate a toxic workplace [00:02:54].

*   **"What's your minimum acceptable salary?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
    *   This directly asks how cheaply they can hire you, suggesting little flexibility in compensation and a tendency to lowball employees [00:03:12]. This can impact future raises and promotions, making it difficult to maintain a competitive salary [00:03:22].

*   **"Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
    *   This question often indicates a high turnover issue within the company or department [00:03:42]. It suggests the employer is trying to mitigate a cultural problem rather than assessing your potential success in the role [00:03:49].

*   **"Have you ever been fired?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    *   This question is generally not pertinent to your ability to perform the job at hand [00:04:17]. Past employment decisions do not always predict future performance, as a termination could stem from a bad situation [00:04:23].
    *   **[[Strategies for job interview success | Interview Strategy]]:** Redirect the conversation to focus on your future contributions and accomplishments in past roles [00:04:37]. If the interviewer continues to probe aggressively, consider withdrawing your candidacy [00:04:49].

*   **Accusations of exaggerating or embellishing your resume.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    *   Assuming your resume is truthful, this signifies a lack of trust from the employer from the outset, or an assumption that all candidates are dishonest [00:05:06]. This is a significant indicator of a toxic culture [00:05:20].

*   **"What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>
    *   This can be a trap question, with answers potentially used as a bias against you [00:05:31]. While it might aim to gauge how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase such inquiries [00:05:38].
    *   **[[Strategies for job interview success | Interview Strategy]]:** When answering, focus primarily on how you overcame the adversity and turned the situation into a positive outcome, rather than dwelling on the failure itself [00:05:53].

*   **Asking about availability for off-shifts or weekends, especially for remote roles about coming on-site.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
    *   For hourly roles, this may suggest an expectation of frequent, possibly involuntary, overtime, indicating a poor work-life balance [00:06:16].
    *   For remote jobs, persistent questions about on-site availability suggest it's a hybrid role, not truly remote, and could eventually become 100% in-office [00:06:34].
    *   **[[Strategies for job interview success | Interview Strategy]]:** Push back to gain clear expectations about actual work hours and on-site requirements [00:06:26].

*   **"How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
    *   This is a strong red flag indicating a potential culture of rudeness or challenging interpersonal dynamics within the workplace [00:07:07]. If the manager is implied to be rude, it's a significant warning sign [00:07:13].

### The Absence of Opportunity to Ask Questions

A critical red flag is when the interviewer dominates the conversation and does not allow you to ask questions of your own [00:07:33]. An interview is a two-way street where you should also be assessing the company and the interviewer [00:07:45]. An employer who takes offense to your questions or believes they are "above" being assessed may not offer a desirable company culture [00:08:08].

## Overall Assessment

One or two of these questions alone may not definitively classify a company as poor quality [00:08:27]. However, they serve as crucial data points to consider [00:08:33]. It's essential to ask thorough probing questions to gain a full understanding of the opportunity before accepting a job offer [00:08:37].

When you find yourself in a [[identifying_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic work environment]] where you suspect the company is attempting "quiet firing" or "constructive dismissal," there are several courses of action you can consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This situation, where a company makes your employment unbearable to prompt your voluntary departure, can arise if they view you as a potential problem or wish to avoid paying benefits like unemployment insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Identifying Quiet Firing
Before considering options, it's helpful to recognize the [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | signs]] of quiet firing. These include:
*   Not receiving a raise in several years, especially if colleagues have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Being repeatedly passed over for promotions despite efforts to position yourself for one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Denied PTO or vacation requests repeatedly, assuming proper coordination and non-abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   Being placed on an unreasonable Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or similar performance management tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Sudden changes to your schedule, such as mandatory overtime during inconvenient times, or hours being cut to the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   An unbearable workload being suddenly dumped on you without additional pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   Receiving suddenly lackluster performance appraisals, particularly if they were previously good, with your boss becoming overly critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   Your boss disengaging from you, missing one-on-ones, not responding to emails, or generally being unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Being removed from projects you typically led, not invited to meetings you used to attend, or being excluded from office conversations and shunned publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

While one or two of these signs alone don't confirm quiet firing, it's important to pay attention and trust your intuition if you notice multiple indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Options for Action
If you suspect you are being constructively dismissed, here are three main [[strategies_to_deal_with_toxic_workplaces | strategies]]:

### 1. Maintain Status Quo
You can choose to continue as normal and force the company to terminate your employment if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### 2. Seek a New Opportunity
Embracing a "free agent" mindset, you can proactively seek a new job that offers a more supportive and healthier environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Staying in a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic environment]] is detrimental to your personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Update your Resume**: It is always best practice to have your resume up-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Resources like "Resume Rocket Fuel" can help you write a resume that recruiters will notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Network**: Start working on your networks and engage with the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### 3. Consult an Attorney
If you believe you are being discriminated against, you should consult a local attorney to understand your legal rights and options based on local laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Impact of a Toxic Environment
Remaining in a [[impact_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic environment]] can have significant [[effects_of_a_toxic_work_culture_on_health and_career | negative effects]] on your personal life, mental health, and career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Therefore, taking action to address or remove yourself from such a situation is crucial for your overall well-being and professional future.

Being caught in a layoff can be a significant ego hit, leading to self-doubt and questions about why one was selected [00:00:01]. While a common scenario involves an unexpected meeting notification, an HR person, and the presentation of severance terms, often accompanied by assurances that it's "not your fault," in many cases, this is true [00:00:31]. Companies employ various criteria when deciding which employees to include on a layoff list [00:00:10].

## Common Reasons for Layoffs

### Performance-Related
One of the most obvious reasons people assume for a layoff is performance [01:03:01]. This occurs when an employee's performance is lower than their team, department, or peers in similar departments across the organization [01:13:01]. Companies typically evaluate overall performance, output, or measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) [01:22:01]. A visible performance tracking board in a team room is often the best indicator of layoff risk during downsizing [01:30:01]. Similarly, performance appraisal ratings are often pulled, with the lowest performers being targeted [01:52:01]. Some companies also use a "nine-box" ranking system, where managers rank employees, and those falling into the bottom quadrants are often selected for layoff [02:02:01]. While it's unfortunate, lower-performing individuals are often among the first affected [02:15:01].

However, being laid off does not automatically mean an employee had a performance issue, as many reasons for layoffs are unrelated to individual performance [02:21:01].

### Seniority
Another major reason for layoffs is seniority, often employing a "last in, first out" mentality [02:30:01]. Companies may target recently hired employees first [02:37:01]. This creates considerable risk for individuals leaving an established position for a new job, as they might become the "low person on the totem pole" [02:50:01]. While seniority is a factor, new employees must still outperform peers, as seniority alone won't prevent a layoff if performance is low [03:08:01].

### Skills or Role Obsolescence
Layoffs can occur due to an employee's skills becoming obsolete or if their specific role is no longer needed by the organization [03:16:01]. This is distinct from a performance issue; if a company no longer needs certain skills, they will still lay off employees possessing them [03:31:01]. Similarly, if an organization has evolved beyond certain job types or roles, employees in those positions may be affected if they haven't evolved with the market [03:40:01]. To mitigate this, individuals should monitor industry trends, acquire the latest in-demand software or technical skills, and adapt to their company's evolving needs, for example, by reskilling to become an expert in new software [03:51:01]. The rise of AI in the workplace is accelerating this trend, making "adapt or be left behind" a crucial consideration [04:31:01].

### Departmental Need and Strategic Direction
[[role_of_skills_and_departmental_need_in_layoffs | Departmental need]] is a very common reason for layoffs, especially seen in the tech industry [04:42:01]. This occurs when a department shifts its focus, de-emphasizes certain products or groups, and consequently no longer needs specific roles or teams [04:50:01]. These layoffs are driven by the strategic direction of the organization, not individual performance [05:02:01]. Even top performers or recently promoted individuals can be affected if their division or project is de-emphasized due to leadership changes and strategic shifts [05:07:01].

While unpredictable, employees can de-risk this by avoiding experimental projects or "Skunk Works" during times of economic uncertainty, as these are often the first to be eliminated [05:33:01]. Projects or teams that are not part of the core business or are not generating significant revenue are also indicators of potential downsizing [06:02:01].

### Cost-Cutting Measures
[[cost_cutting_measures_and_their_effects_on_layoffs | Cost cutting measures]] are a significant driver for layoffs [06:13:01]. Divisions not making money or experimental projects are often targeted [06:15:01]. Companies may spin off or eliminate such organizations to reduce costs [06:23:01]. It is also common for companies to review departments, identify high-earning individuals, and compare their salaries to their output or skill [06:33:01]. Senior career professionals whose skills may have atrophied or not kept pace with the market, yet command large salaries, can become easy targets, as they can be replaced by cheaper alternatives [06:44:01]. Payroll is typically a company's largest expense and is heavily scrutinized during economic uncertainty, especially with disruptive technologies like AI potentially eliminating more positions [07:01:01].

### Voluntary Severance Programs
Companies sometimes offer voluntary severance programs to reduce their workforce [07:17:01]. These programs provide lucrative packages, often appealing as early retirement options, to incentivize a certain percentage of employees to leave willingly [07:20:01]. If the targeted reduction isn't met through voluntary exits, the company will then use other criteria to forcibly lay off the remaining necessary number of employees [07:39:01].

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
While not openly stated, legal and ethical considerations can sometimes play a role in layoff decisions, even if covertly [08:17:01]. This can include age-based discrimination, where older, higher-earning individuals might be targeted (sometimes referred to as "dinosaurs") [08:27:01]. Other protected classes, such as gender, creed, or color, can also be subject to unscrupulous practices by certain companies [08:44:01].

## Reclaiming Control of Your Career
Despite the unfairness and the "at-will employment" reality, individuals can reclaim control of their careers [09:02:01]. This involves:
*   **Building Skill Sets**: Continuously developing skills that are in demand in the broader market, not just within one's current company [09:24:01].
*   **Maintaining an Updated Resume**: Keeping one's resume current and considering other opportunities that align with long-term career visions [09:31:01].
*   **Networking**: Actively networking, including with competitors, to stay well-connected within the industry and secure better job opportunities [09:39:01]. Targeted networking, especially leveraging platforms like LinkedIn, can allow individuals to bypass recruiters and jump to the front of the line [11:15:01].
*   **Multiple Streams of Income**: Developing multiple income streams reduces dependence on a single employer, offering greater control and freedom in one's career [09:54:01].

Ultimately, a layoff does not mean one is "damaged goods" or automatically indicates a performance issue [12:00:01]. Individuals should focus on building a strong overarching career strategy to increase their chances of success [11:39:01].

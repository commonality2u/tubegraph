When companies undertake [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]], the decision to reduce staff often stems from shifts in departmental needs and overarching strategic direction, rather than individual [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This means employees can be impacted through no fault of their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## How Departmental Changes Lead to Layoffs

A significant [[reasons_companies_lay_off_employees | reason for layoffs]] is a change in departmental focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This can occur when a department deemphasizes a specific product or group, leading to the elimination of roles no longer deemed necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. These decisions are tied to the strategic direction of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

Unfortunately, even top performers or those recently promoted within a division can be caught in these situations if leadership changes and shifts strategic direction, deemphasizing their project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

## Cost-Cutting Measures

[[financial_adjustments_and_budgeting_postlayoff | Cost-cutting measures]] are another major [[reasons_companies_lay_off_employees | reason]] for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. This often targets employees in experimental divisions or those not generating significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Companies might spin off or eliminate projects entirely due to these measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

Companies also commonly review departments, identifying employees with high salaries and comparing them to their output or [[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This can particularly affect senior employees whose [[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | skills]] may have atrophied or not kept pace with the market, making them expensive to retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Payroll is a significant company expense, leading to close scrutiny during times of economic uncertainty and with the rise of disruptive technologies like AI, which can potentially eliminate positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## Risk Mitigation

While it's impossible to perfectly predict these circumstances, employees can mitigate their risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Avoiding experimental or "Skunk Works" projects, especially during periods of economic uncertainty, as these are often the first to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   Assessing if the project, team, or division you're part of is central to the core business or a significant revenue generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Projects or divisions that are not core or not making money are indicators that they might be targeted for downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Impact on Employees

An untimely layoff, even if not performance-related, can derail a promising career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. It's crucial for individuals to reclaim control by:
*   Continuously building [[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | skill sets]] to remain in demand across the broader market, not just within their current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   Maintaining an up-to-date resume and exploring other opportunities that align with long-term career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   Engaging in targeted networking, even with competitors, to stay connected within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   Developing multiple streams of income to reduce complete dependence on a single employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

Being laid off due to departmental needs or strategic shifts does not mean an individual is "damaged goods" or indicates a [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

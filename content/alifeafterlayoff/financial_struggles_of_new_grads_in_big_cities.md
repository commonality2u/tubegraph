A recent college graduate's viral TikTok post highlighted the significant [[challenges_of_transitioning_from_college_to_workforce|disconnect]] between college life and the reality of a nine-to-five job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While college typically involves less responsibility, the workplace presents a demanding reality of a continuous 9-to-5 grind for most of one's adult life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The speaker notes that younger generations, particularly [[Job market challenges for Gen Z in 2024|Generation Z]], appear less prepared for these workplace realities than previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Daily Commute and Work-Life Balance

The TikTok user described a challenging daily routine:
*   **Long Commute** The new grad commutes to a city job, unable to afford living in the city itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Her commute involves leaving home at 7:30 AM and not returning until 6:15 PM or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Personal Time** This extensive schedule leaves her with no time or energy for personal activities like cooking, working out, or socializing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that this lengthy day is "about right" for many in big cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, noting that remote work's appeal stems from eliminating this commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Job Market Challenges and Financial Instability

The new grad's experience highlights several [[employer_expectations_from_recent_college_graduates|challenges for recent college graduates]] entering the workforce:
*   **Layoff After Public Complaint** The grad was unfortunately laid off from her first post-college job after publicly sharing her dissatisfaction on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Difficult Job Search** It took her five months to secure this initial position, for which she moved to New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Her employer was a startup that lacked the workload or bandwidth to properly train her or assign meaningful tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Hiring Slowdown** She was laid off right before the holidays, a period when hiring processes typically halt from mid-December until mid-to-late January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Salaries** Her 9-to-5 job did not provide a living wage, preventing her from saving money or building an emergency fund, with all income going towards living expenses and commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The speaker agrees that many college graduates' salaries are insufficient to live comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **High Cost of Living in Big Cities** New York City is particularly challenging for career beginnings due to its "extraordinary expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Broader Implications for New Graduates

The situation highlights broader issues for new graduates:
*   **The Value of a Degree** The grad noted that despite having a degree, two internships, a portfolio, and freelance work, it still felt "not enough" to secure a job that paid a living wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of high education costs and student loans|Student Loan Debt vs. Earning Potential]]** The speaker questions the viability of college given the "extraordinary amount of debt" accumulated versus the salaries earned by graduates, suggesting that without supplementary income, it's difficult to get ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Need for Side Hustles** To gain control and avoid taking "crappy jobs" out of desperation, developing "side income streams" or "side hustles" is suggested, especially early in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. While this requires hard work, it can offer a way out of the traditional 9-to-5 grind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of strategic career planning from the outset to avoid future regrets and achieve greater financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The [[challenges_of_the_current_job_market|current job market]] is volatile, and new generations will likely bring significant changes to the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

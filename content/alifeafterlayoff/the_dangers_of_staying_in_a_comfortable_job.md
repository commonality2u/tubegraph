Brian, from A Life After Layoff, shares his personal career story to illustrate the importance of taking ownership of one's career, acting as the "CEO of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He emphasizes that many people take a wrong turn in their careers that sets them back, and his own experience serves as a cautionary tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## A Career Promise Unfulfilled

Early in his career, Brian was recruited into a relatively small company of about six to seven hundred employees in the railroad services industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. He accepted the Staffing and Development Manager role, which evolved into a Human Resources Manager position, due to a clear promise: he was to learn from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was slated to retire in 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The expectation was that after this period, Brian would be promoted to run the entire HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The work itself was substantial and provided valuable experience, allowing him to significantly impact the business by seeing people hired and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The company fostered a "family-oriented atmosphere," with supportive owners and a relatively laid-back environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Brian enjoyed a high degree of freedom and flexibility with his schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. His boss, though old-school in approach, had a high degree of empathy for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### The Stagnation Point

Despite the initial promise, 18 months passed, and it became clear that his boss had no intention of retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This was a common trend among the senior leadership, who were nearing retirement age but clung to their "kingdoms" due to significant bonuses and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Brian was part of a leadership development group, being groomed for succession, but his boss continuously told him he wasn't "ready yet" and needed more development, without providing actual opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. His peers in the development group faced similar issues, with their bosses outwardly supportive but privately doubting their readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Consequently, these peers, taking ownership of their careers, began leaving the organization one by one, with some achieving significant roles elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Out of his succession group, only about one in eight to ten people reached the promised level within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Brian, however, remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He became apathetic and comfortable, "just collecting a steady paycheck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. He gave up on his dream of becoming the head HR person after about seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, eventually moving to a different role within the same company for his last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It took his boss a total of nine years to retire after initially promising 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Consequences of Comfort

Brian acknowledges that while he doesn't regret working for the organization, he deeply regrets how he handled his career during that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. His comfort led him to stop making decisions that were in the best interest of his long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. He likens this to playing checkers instead of chess with his career, lacking a plan or strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The [[risks_of_staying_in_one_role_for_too_long | dangers of staying in one role for too long]] included:
*   **Stunted Growth**: He stopped trying to learn, keep up with industry trends, latest technology, or buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Loss of Passion**: He lost his desire to advance in HR and went into "autopilot," performing his duties but not volunteering for extra projects or caring about promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Self-Belief**: Hearing "you're not ready" repeatedly for years caused him to start believing it, despite others in similar situations thriving after leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Career Setback**: When he eventually re-entered the job market, he discovered he was significantly behind his peer group in skills, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. He had to take a step downward in responsibility to gain current recruiting experience, while his peers were moving into senior director roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This mistake set him back roughly a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Financial Impact**: His complacency led to thousands of dollars in lost income, as he found he was significantly underpaid compared to the market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Take Ownership of Your Career

Brian's story underscores the crucial lesson: if you want to achieve something in your career, you must learn to play chess, not checkers, by being the "CEO of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This means taking ownership and not waiting for opportunities to come to you or for others to recognize your efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

He advises:
*   **Avoid Apathy**: Don't be apathetic or wait for things to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Recognize Your "Runway"**: Career "runways" shorten quickly, especially in mid-career, so proactive planning is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Beware of Being "Too Good"**: If you're too good at your current job, the company might keep you stuck in that role, preventing your advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Continually Test the Market**: A true "CEO of their career" consistently tests the open market and entertains other opportunities to find the best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This includes leveraging networks like LinkedIn to have recruiters contact you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Brian's experiences shaped his advice on resume building, effective self-marketing in interviews (especially when seeking promotion), and negotiation, all aimed at helping others avoid his mistakes and advance their careers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

The start of 2024 has been "pretty brutal for the job Seeker," with widespread [[the_role_of_ai_in_layoffs_and_workforce_reduction | layoffs]] occurring across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While the tech sector has been leading in job cuts, the trend is now affecting other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A primary reason cited by company leaders for these [[the_role_of_ai_in_layoffs_and_workforce_reduction | layoffs]] is an "uptick in AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, confirming that artificial intelligence is already impacting employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Companies are making "bigger bets on AI" to improve productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Technology Sector

The tech industry continues to experience significant [[the_role_of_ai_in_layoffs_and_workforce_reduction | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, over 20,000 people in the tech industry were laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **Cisco Systems**: Announced a major [[the_role_of_ai_in_layoffs_and_workforce_reduction | layoff]] on February 14th, affecting 5% of their global workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The company plans to shift its focus to "key priority areas" such as [[role_of_emerging_technologies_and_ai_in_the_tech_job_market | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Google**: In January, Google laid off hundreds of employees in its ads division due to a shift to "AI-powered sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Many of these individuals were reassigned or laid off because AI was replacing their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Google has integrated generative AI features into its ads, including natural language chatbots that are making customer service and sales roles redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The "Performance Max" product uses AI algorithms to tweak ads, a task previously done by humans providing sales guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Coding & Programming**: Tech jobs such as coding, computer programming, software engineering, and data analysis are highly susceptible to AI replacement, as AI tools can produce "good clean code" and perform lower-level work "much more efficiently than a human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Administrative and Back-Office Functions

AI is increasingly automating roles that involve routine administrative and data entry tasks.

*   **IBM**: In May 2023, IBM's CEO Arvind Krishna announced plans to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI, primarily in back-office functions such as Human Resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It's expected that 30% of non-customer-facing roles, including finance and accounting, will be affected over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Support Staff**: One CEO in India replaced 90% of support staff with AI chatbots, citing increased efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **General Clerical and Administrative Work**: AI is adept at tasks like generating HR letters, boilerplate text, and clerical duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This particularly impacts junior and mid-level workers whose jobs involve "mundane tasks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Creative and Content Creation Industries

The advent of advanced AI technologies is significantly affecting creative roles.

*   **Writing & Advertising**: AI is capable of performing creative work, writing, and generating advertising copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This includes "boilerplate text" and "advertising copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Workers in marketing and advertising have high AI adoption rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Photography and Graphic Design**: AI can now create "very photorealistic portraits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, raising concerns for professional photographers. AI allows for ad campaigns to be created by typing "a few prompts," eliminating the need for talent, permits, rights, or model releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Graphic designers are also advised to be concerned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Media and Journalism**: This sector is already impacted, with many publications laying off editorial staff in favor of AI-driven content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Media jobs, including content creation, technical writing, and journalism, are vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Legal Industry

AI is streamlining the creation of legal documents and potentially redefining roles.

*   **Paralegals and Legal Assistants**: AI can efficiently perform "grunt work" and "heavy lifting" associated with technical writing in the legal field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Robot Lawyers**: There is an instance of an AI-powered robot lawyer intended to represent a defendant in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. AI threatens to replace humans for tasks "simple to execute," such as following a script or drafting standard legal documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Financial Services

AI's ability to analyze data quickly poses a threat to many financial roles.

*   **Financial Analysts & Personal Financial Advisors**: ChatGPT can analyze trends and predict market movements, which could impact roles like financial analysts and personal financial advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Accounting can also be "lumped into this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Traders**: Much of trading is already automated, and AI bots could potentially replace human traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Other Affected Roles

*   **Market Research Analysts**: AI is highly effective at analyzing large datasets, compiling information, and presenting it in usable formats, making market research analysts vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Teachers**: ChatGPT can "easily teach classes" and assist teachers with lesson planning and grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, potentially leading to full replacement.
*   **Customer Service Agents**: Chatbots are already taking over online customer service roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Recruiters**: Recruitment is likely to see robots replace human recruiters for "tedious work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. AI recruiters can scan applications and make decisions based on an "analytical process," potentially making it harder for job seekers, especially those changing careers, as AI may lack the ability to interpret transferable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## The Broader [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | Impact of AI on Employment]]

A survey by Resume Builder found that 44% of companies expect AI to replace employees next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. CEOs are "actively figuring out ways to implement AI" aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Tasks such as "creative work, writing administrative and clerical work" are being automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. An expert predicted that between 15% and 70% of computer-based work could be automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While AI tools like ChatGPT are presented as aids to "improve jobs" and automate mundane tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, companies are often using them to replace human roles for cost savings, potentially at the expense of creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

> "The software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue the human labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

This trend indicates a significant shift in the job market, as companies prioritize efficiency and cost reduction through AI adoption, affecting a wide range of industries and job functions.

The current job market presents significant challenges for job seekers, with many experiencing frustration due to difficulty securing interviews or landing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While factors like a struggling economy, widespread layoffs, and stiff competition contribute to this difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, another reason positions are hard to obtain is the preference for internal hiring over external recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Prevalence of Internal Hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>

It is common for positions to be filled by internal applicants, especially when companies are hesitant to add new headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In such cases, organizations may move existing employees between roles internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Reasons for External Job Postings Despite Internal Intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>

Even if a company intends to fill a role internally, they might still post the job externally. This often occurs because some organizations or specific positions have a requirement to conduct external recruitment, even if there's no real intention of hiring an outside candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Impact on External Applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

An unexpected internal candidate might emerge late in the hiring process, leading to external applicants being removed from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This situation, where an internal candidate effectively "cuts in front" of external ones, happens "somewhat regularly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

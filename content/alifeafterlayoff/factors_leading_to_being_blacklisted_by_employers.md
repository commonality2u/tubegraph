Have you ever found yourself unable to get hired by a company, even a former employer you left on good terms with, despite being perfectly qualified? You might have been blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This practice, where companies maintain a "block list" or "do not hire" list, is a confirmed reality, with companies like Meta acknowledging its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Blacklisting Former Employees (Meta's Case Study)

A Business Insider exposé revealed that former Meta employees were blocked from rehire, placed on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These individuals often discovered their blacklisted status indirectly, typically after a recruiter or hiring manager expressed interest, only for the internal recruiting team to [[reasons_why_employers_ghost_candidates | ghost]] them or deem them ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Meta uses multiple internal systems, including a "non-regrettable attrition designation" and a "do not hire flag," to track rehire ineligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Most companies track this information in their Human Resources Information System (HRIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Specific Reasons for Blacklisting at Meta (and other employers)

While Meta's official stance claims clear criteria for being marked ineligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, the exposé suggests broader, less transparent reasons:

*   **Layoffs initially deemed non-performance based**: Some employees laid off in Meta's 2022 wave were high performers, often with "exceeding expectations" ratings and promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Despite being told their layoff was a "business decision" and not performance-related, and despite hiring managers wanting them back, HR policies led to them being blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Later, Meta changed its policy, stating all future layoffs would be performance-based, potentially creating a "scarlet letter" for those previously laid off, even if they were good performers <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Managerial Discretion**: Managers could add names to the "do not hire" list without documented performance issues, simply if they "didn't like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Voluntary Separation Circumstances**:
    *   **Rage quitting**: Leaving abruptly without notice and in a negative manner can lead to being permanently banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This status can be "tattooed" into your employment file and follow you permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   **"Non-regrettable attrition"**: If a manager designates an employee's departure as "non-regrettable," meaning they were happy for the person to leave, it can lead to blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Clear-Cut Policy Violations**:
    *   Violating workplace policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Stealing confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
    *   Performance termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
    *   Involuntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Informal Blacklisting for New Applicants

Even without prior employment, candidates can face a form of blacklisting, often more ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

*   **Spamming applications**: Applying for the same job repeatedly, or applying for many different and unrelated jobs at one company, can be seen as spamming and lead to a bias against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Staffing teams and hiring managers observe application activity and history, leading to questions about why other managers haven't hired the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Unsuccessful Interview Processes**:
    *   **Technical skill deficiency**: For technical roles, if a candidate fails a technical screen (e.g., coding), they might have a "recycle period" (e.g., 6 months) after which they can reapply without prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Leadership principle failure**: If removed from the interview process for failing "leadership principles" (behavior-based interviews), there is often no recycling period, effectively banning the candidate permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Backdoor References

A "backdoor reference" can also lead to blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This occurs when a hiring team member contacts someone they know at your previous company to ask about you, outside of the formal reference process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. These informal references can sink a candidate's chances and potentially lead to being blacklisted, especially in smaller industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This happens behind the scenes, and the candidate is usually unaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

While some employers actively use "do not hire" lists, it is not believed to be a widespread practice across all industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The [[impact_of_blacklisting_on_job_seekers | impact of blacklisting]] can create an invisible barrier in an already competitive job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. To counter this, it's crucial to reclaim control over your career by focusing on building a career with high conviction and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

When preparing for a job interview, it is crucial to be ready for the question, "What are your salary expectations?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> This question is likely to come up during the preliminary interview with a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. How you answer can significantly impact the final offer, as the number you state at this stage often follows you through the entire hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Therefore, having a good [[salary_negotiation_strategies | strategy]] is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Why This Question is Important
Many job seekers leave money on the table if they are not prepared for this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Even with salary transparency laws, published ranges can be abnormally wide and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. It's important to control the compensation discussion by being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## [[how_to_prepare_for_salary_discussions_in_interviews | Preparation]]
Before your interview, conduct thorough [[how_to_prepare_for_salary_discussions_in_interviews | salary research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Determine the minimum acceptable salary you would need to feel comfortable in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Shifting the Question Back to the Interviewer
When asked about your salary requirements, try to put the question back on them first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Ask if they are willing to share the salary range for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. If their shared range is within your acceptable limits, you have a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### When the Interviewer Pushes Back
If the interviewer insists on you providing a number first, be strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
A recommended response is:
> "Other opportunities that I'm considering are paying between [insert your minimum acceptable salary] and [insert 20% above that minimum]. Does that seem to make sense with you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

**Example:**
If your minimum acceptable salary is $100,000, you might say:
> "Other companies that I'm considering are paying between $100,000 and $120,000. Does that seem to make sense with you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>

This approach provides a range, offering [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_employers | wiggle room]] for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### What to Avoid
*   Do not disclose your previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Do not state only what you *would like* to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Always provide a range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## When to Bring Up Compensation Later
If the recruiter has committed to moving you to the next round of interviews but hasn't covered [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectations]], it's an appropriate time to raise the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. You can state:
> "Hey, you know, I'm really interested in this opportunity, but in order for me to commit to the next round, I just want to make sure that we're on the same page. Can we talk compensation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

You can then refer back to the strategy of giving a range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

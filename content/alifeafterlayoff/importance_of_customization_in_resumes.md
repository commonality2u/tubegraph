As a recruiter and career coach, it's clear that many résumés need improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While there isn't a single "right" way to write a resume, the effectiveness of your resume is measured by whether it yields the desired results, such as landing job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The following tips, based on a corporate recruiter's perspective and hiring manager feedback, aim to help improve your resume's presentation and capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Why Customize Your Resume?

[[Importance of customizing resumes | Customizing your resume]] is a crucially important step, especially in today's job market, particularly for coveted remote roles where competition is fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Many applicants are "lazy" and don't customize their resumes, creating an opportunity for those who do to gain a competitive advantage and get the phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. You cannot approach your job search as if it's still 2018; the market is fundamentally different today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Instead of summarizing everything you've ever accomplished in your career, start thinking about "profiling" your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This means delivering exactly what the employer is looking for for a specific role, rather than hoping they find something they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The focus should shift from irrelevant career accomplishments to what hiring teams genuinely care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This is a more effective approach to writing resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## [[Optimizing and customizing resumes for job applications | Tips for Customization]]

### Avoid Outdated or Overly Designed Templates
Stop using outdated templates, especially those designed by graphic designers with excessive graphics, charts, or "cute" presentations, which can distract from the resume's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These templates are often ineffective because they are not designed with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in mind, which parse resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

For most roles, a resume should be relatively "boring" in its design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Opt for simple templates, like those found in Microsoft Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. When choosing a template, select one with a single column, avoid bright or flashy colors and graphics, and ensure fonts are clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Basic colors like blue, black, or dark green are generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The only exception might be for graphic designers or those in creative fields where a more artistic resume is expected, though even then, using a template by another designer isn't ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Format Contact Information Vertically
Avoid placing your contact information horizontally, as Applicant Tracking Systems typically struggle to read and parse it effectively in that format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Vertical formatting allows the ATS to find and input information cleanly into the correct fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If you frequently need to manually enter your name, phone number, or address when applying for jobs, your resume may not be ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Be Concise and Clear
[[how_to_effectively_convey_information_in_resumes | Avoid being overly wordy]] with your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Long blocks of text can cause eyes to glaze over, and recruiters are likely to skip over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Be concise and selective with your words and how they are laid out on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Avoid Proprietary and Generic Language
[[Impact of irrelevant work history and unnecessary details on resumes | Remove proprietary language]] specific to your current company, such as internal project names, division names, or product types, as the open market likely won't understand them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The goal is to convey concepts in clear, common language for the industry you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

[[Avoiding personal identifiers and unprofessional elements in resumes | Eliminate generic, fluffy terminology]] like "team player" or "great organizational skills," as these often make recruiters roll their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Important competencies will be assessed in an interview anyway, and your resume isn't the place to demonstrate them in this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Instead, focus on more actionable terms and concepts directly related to the job you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The aim is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job, not to impress with an elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Be Adaptable
[[Challenges and tips for resume optimization | If your resume isn't working]], be willing to redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Repeated rejections at the application level suggest your resume is not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This is especially true if you believe you have a clear fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're applying to by closely examining the job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Ensure your resume clearly conveys this fit to maximize your chances of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

If your resume isn't yielding results, make changes and try different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

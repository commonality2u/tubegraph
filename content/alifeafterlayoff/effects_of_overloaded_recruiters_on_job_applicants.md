Employment ghosting is a common and frustrating experience for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While there are various reasons why employers might ghost candidates, one significant factor is the workload and capacity of recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Defining Employment Ghosting
Employment ghosting occurs when an employer or company representative moves a candidate into a formalized interviewing process but then fails to follow up on the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It is not considered ghosting if a candidate simply applies to a role and does not receive a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## The Problem of Overloaded Recruiters
A professional recruiter should ideally manage between 15 to 25 requisitions (job openings) at a time, depending on the industry, role type, and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. When recruiters are assigned significantly more than 25 requisitions, such as 40 to 50, it doubles their workload beyond a reasonable capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Impact on Candidate Experience
When recruiters are overloaded, the [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] inevitably suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. If a recruiter is responsible for sending three or more interviewable candidates per job, and they manage 40+ jobs, they could be interacting with over 200 candidates concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. In such high-volume situations, even the most organized recruiters may inadvertently let candidates "fall through the cracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Common scenarios include:
*   **Forgetting to follow up** Due to the high volume of candidates and lack of proper tools or processes, recruiters may simply forget to provide updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. While this is not an excuse for poor performance, it's a known occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of internal controls** Companies without formalized talent acquisition departments or robust internal processes often struggle with effective candidate communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Bad software that cannot handle the volume of applicants can also contribute to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Hiring Manager Delays and Indecisiveness** Overloaded recruiters often have to contend with hiring managers who are slow to make decisions or request additional candidates, which can delay the process by weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This can make it appear to candidates that they have been ghosted, even if they haven't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Recruiters must often push back on managers to make timely decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Positions Placed on Hold or Re-scoped** Jobs may be paused or redefined mid-process, with hiring managers sometimes asking recruiters to keep candidates "lukewarm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This means keeping them interested without making a decision, which is not good for [[impact_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. When a requisition is closed, recruiters may not always follow up with all remaining candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Hiring another candidate** Sometimes, a recruiter closes out a requisition after hiring a candidate but fails to close out or inform the other candidates in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or inefficient recruiting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Best Practices
Some organizations, like Amazon, hold their recruiters accountable with strict metrics regarding [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Amazon's "two and five promise" dictates that after a hiring manager phone screen, candidates receive an update within two days, and after an on-site interview loop, feedback is provided within five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This system forces hiring teams to be efficient and decisive, and recruiters to obtain quick answers, preventing candidates from being ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This approach recognizes that job seekers are often customers, and a negative interview experience can impact business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## What Candidates Can Do
If a job seeker suspects they have been ghosted, there is not much they can do other than send a polite "nudge" to the recruiter after some time has passed to inquire about the application status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This reminder often prompts recruiters to check and provide an update or properly close out the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

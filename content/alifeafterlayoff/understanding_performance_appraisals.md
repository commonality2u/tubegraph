Performance appraisals are formal evaluations of an employee's job performance. A sudden and drastic decline in your performance appraisal scores can be a significant red flag, indicating potential job insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This is especially concerning if you previously had a history of positive appraisals and were caught off guard by the lower rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Role in Employee Termination Process

From a Human Resources (HR) perspective, a lowered performance appraisal is often part of a documented process leading to potential dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

A sudden shift from a well-documented positive work history to a "does not meet expectations" appraisal can appear to HR as a "rash decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   Implementing documented coaching sessions with the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Ensuring these performance issues are reflected in subsequent performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Navigating a job interview can be challenging, feeling "a bit like navigating a Minefield" where "one wrong step can end you up in the no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. To increase your chances of success, it's crucial to avoid revealing certain personal details that could inadvertently create biases against you.

## Avoiding Revelation of Age

Employers may form [[employer_biases_against_hiring_older_workers | employer biases]] based on a candidate's perceived age, leading to [[age_discrimination_in_the_job_market | age discrimination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. This can affect both younger and older job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

To avoid inadvertently revealing your age:
*   **Review Contact Information** Be cautious with technologies or email addresses that might indicate your age. For example, a resume that included a fax number indicated the person was "a little out of place in the [[challenges_older_job_seekers_face_in_the_job_market | job market]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Mind Resume Dates** Carefully manage the dates on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Do Not State Your Age** When sitting down for an interview, do not explicitly offer how old you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

### Years Left in the Workforce

It is also advisable not to indicate how many years you have left in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. While common for those nearing the end of their careers to state intentions like "I just want to land this last job, the last stop of my career, put in 10 good years and ride off into the sunset," this can create a liability for the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

Hiring managers often seek candidates with long-term commitment, sometimes 10+ years, even if average tenure is shorter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Disclosing short-term plans can lead to an [[employer_biases_against_hiring_older_workers | employer bias]] and a rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Revelation of Political Beliefs

It can be tempting to share your political belief system, especially if you feel it aligns with a company's mission or a hiring manager's viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. However, it is best to avoid this entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

> "The political spectrum is very wide, it's very heated, very opinionated and it's better just to stay completely out of it because you never know what the belief system is of the hiring manager you're interviewing for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

Keeping political discussions out of the interview helps in [[avoiding_political_and_sensitive_topics_at_work | avoiding political and sensitive topics at work]] and preventing potential biases based on differing viewpoints.

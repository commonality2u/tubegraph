LinkedIn is widely recognized as a premier platform for networking and job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, it's also a subject of strong opinions, with many users feeling it has become "fake" and "cringy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Despite its flaws, it holds significant influence over the job market, as it's where recruiters and companies are present, making its use almost obligatory for those seeking white-collar careers and quality jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## How We Got Here: The Rise of Online Job Boards

Before the internet, job seekers relied on newspaper classifieds, physical applications at company headquarters, word-of-mouth, mailing resumes, or physical bulletin boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The shift to online job searching began in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:

*   **Online Career Center (OCC)**: Launched in 1993 as the first online job board, starting as a gopher site before moving to the web, offering a simple database of listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Monster.com**: Emerged in 1994, revolutionizing the space with a more user-friendly interface and broader reach, allowing candidates to post resumes and companies to list jobs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **CareerBuilder**: Started in 1995 as a digital extension of newspaper ads, partnering with print publishers to bring listings online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Newspaper ads were still a primary recruitment method through the mid-1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Hot Jobs**: By the late 1990s, Hot Jobs (launched 1997) added features like resume search for employers, making the process more interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

These platforms digitized the job search, bridging the gap between candidates and employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## LinkedIn's Evolution and Influence on Hiring

LinkedIn launched in 2003, but its major impact on hiring began after 2008 with the introduction of company pages and job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. It uniquely combined professional networking with job search, creating a dynamic ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### The Shift to Active Talent Sourcing

By 2010, LinkedIn Recruiter became a primary tool for talent acquisition, enabling recruiters to search profiles with precision rather than just relying on posted resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This marked a significant shift from passive job listings to active talent sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

A major issue is that most job seekers still engage in active applying, while companies overwhelmingly depend on active talent sourcing (recruiters finding candidates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This means if a job seeker isn't being recruited, their chances of getting an interview are significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### The Impact of "Easy Apply"

Introduced in 2011, the "Easy Apply" feature streamlined the application process, making it a simple click to add one's name to a resume pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This has led to:
*   Thousands of candidates "spam applying," often not based in the same country or even qualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Recruiters being overwhelmed by an "avalanche" of applications for nearly every role, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Emphasis on [[importance_of_discoverability_and_networking_in_job_searching | Networking and Personal Branding]]

Hiring now strongly emphasizes [[importance_of_discoverability_and_networking_in_job_searching | networking]] and personal branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. According to LinkedIn itself, 87% of recruiters use the platform to find talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This necessitates job seekers to adapt, though many find the idea of self-marketing through [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | networking]] and branding nauseating, viewing it as "unsavory" or "ass-kissing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Algorithm Prioritization and Content Quality

LinkedIn's algorithms prioritize viral, emotionally charged, generic inspirational stories, "humble brags," or one-size-fits-all advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This often drowns out thoughtful, nuanced, or critical voices, throttling their reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This shallow content dominates feeds, making it hard for genuine professionals to stand out and build credibility, leading many to neglect their [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | networking]] and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms of LinkedIn

### Paywalls and a Two-Tier System

LinkedIn's near monopoly on professional [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | networking]] means being off the platform makes job seekers "virtually invisible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, as its dominance grew, so have its paywalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Features once free, like seeing who viewed your profile, sending direct messages, attaching custom messages to connection requests, or unlimited search, are now behind expensive subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This creates a two-tier system, disadvantaging those who cannot afford premium access, especially unemployed or entry-level job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### [[predatory_job_postings_and_scams_on_linkedin | Predatory Job Postings and Scams]]

A growing issue is the presence of [[predatory_job_postings_and_scams_on_linkedin | predatory job postings and scam recruiters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>:
*   Companies offer unpaid opportunities to experienced professionals, disguised as internships or portfolio projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   "Evergreen posts" are used to collect resumes with no intention of hiring, leaving job seekers feeling used and demoralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   The platform is "rife" with fake recruiters and spam accounts pitching fake jobs, attempting to lure users with interview promises to extract personal information or payment for fake training or equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. These traps can be devastating for unemployed job seekers under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Ineffective [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | Networking]] and Sales Pitches

Even [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | networking]] on LinkedIn can feel hollow and ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Many users lack the knowledge to connect effectively or engage in ways that lead to actual job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This leads to awkward, frustrating interactions that produce no tangible results, causing people to dismiss [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | networking]] as useless and LinkedIn as a "waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Users are also frequently bombarded with sales pitches immediately after accepting connection requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### "Professional Facebook" Environment

LinkedIn has gained a reputation for feeling like a "glorified professional Facebook," overrun with trolls, virtue signaling, engagement mills, and arguments about politics, news, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This "noise" distracts from its intended purpose as a professional space for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> and can deter users from engaging due to fear of backlash, especially since employers can view posting history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Navigating LinkedIn Effectively

To improve the LinkedIn experience, users are advised to "curate their feed ruthlessly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This involves:
*   Unfollowing accounts that post irrelevant or low-quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   Focusing on industry-specific groups or thought leaders who provide value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Utilizing the block feature for toxic trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   Keeping interactions authentic, professional, and career-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Conclusion: LinkedIn's Continued Necessity

Despite its imperfections, LinkedIn remains a necessity for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Nearly every major corporation recruits extensively on the platform, and it is considered the industry standard for recruiter outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. While its job board function has drawbacks, it is still among the best [[using_job_boards_effectively | job boards]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

The true value of LinkedIn lies in its [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | networking]] and branding components, which are beneficial even without a premium subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The problem often is that most people don't use it correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

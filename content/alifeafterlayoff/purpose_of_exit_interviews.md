An exit interview is a meeting requested by Human Resources (HR) after an employee tenders their resignation, typically conducted by an HR representative in the last week of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The primary goal of these interviews is to gather data and insights from departing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Reasons for Conducting Exit Interviews

Organizations conduct exit interviews to collect data on various trends within their workforce and the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This information is used to identify employment trends they should address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Key purposes include:
*   **Identifying Compensation and Benefit Issues** If many employees are leaving due to uncompetitive compensation or benefit concerns, companies can analyze these trends and potentially implement corrective actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Tracking Voluntary Turnover** While some employee churn is normal, companies are most concerned with voluntary turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Good organizations track this to determine if there's a larger underlying problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Assessing Manager Performance** If a particular manager consistently has higher turnover rates than the rest of the organization, HR might investigate that manager's style, offer retraining, or troubleshoot the reasons for the high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The intent behind exit interviews is generally not malicious; it's primarily about collecting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## How Exit Interviews are Conducted

Typically, an HR manager or another HR professional (even entry-level) will conduct the interview, going through a standard form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Common questions include:
*   Why the employee decided to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Where they are going and for what position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   Any feedback they can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Their opinion of their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   Whether they would consider returning to work for the company in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

This information is often stored in the employee's file or a generic HR file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Large companies may use third-party organizations to collect this data, which then generates reports for executive-level staff to track trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Considerations for Participation

While the stated [[Purpose of exit interviews | purpose]] is data collection, there is an [[potential_drawbacks_of_participating_in_exit_interviews | inadvertent dark side]] to participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Exit interviews are voluntary and not required; companies cannot penalize an employee for declining to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

A significant [[potential_drawbacks_of_participating_in_exit_interviews | drawback]] is that the employee gains almost nothing from participating, but there's a [[potential_drawbacks_of_participating_in_exit_interviews | potential for loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Venting about issues like a difficult boss, lack of promotional opportunities, underpayment, or a toxic environment can create a document of grievances associated with the employee's file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

This can [[impact_of_exit_interviews_on_future_employment_opportunities | burn a bridge]] and negatively affect future employment opportunities with that employer if the employee considers returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Being in good standing can shift to being unhirable due to negativity expressed in the exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. It's important to note that when a new employer checks references, they typically cannot reference an exit interview, and doing so could lead to legal trouble for the previous employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

However, if an employee is 100% certain they will never return to that employer, an exit interview can be an opportunity to express their true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. It is important to consider the audienceâ€”an HR representative who may not have decision-making power, and the feedback might fall on deaf ears, primarily serving to make the departing employee feel better temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Ultimately, if an employee is leaving due to valid issues, their boss should already be aware of these problems through regular communication; if it comes as a surprise, it reflects on the boss's awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

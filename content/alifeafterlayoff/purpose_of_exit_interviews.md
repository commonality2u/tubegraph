When an employee resigns from their job, Human Resources (HR) may ask them to participate in an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These interviews are typically conducted by an HR representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Primary Objective: Data Collection

The fundamental reason companies conduct exit interviews is to collect data on overall trends within their workforce as they relate to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This process is generally not "sinister" as people might think; its literal purpose is to gather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Identifying Employment Trends

Companies are looking for any employment trends they should address proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This includes:
*   **Compensation and Benefits:** If many employees are leaving due to uncompetitive compensation or benefit issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Managerial Issues:** Identifying if a particular manager consistently has a higher or abnormally high turnover rate within their team compared to the rest of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Understanding Turnover

Organizations track turnover, differentiating between healthy turnover (some "churn" is normal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> and voluntary turnover, which is what companies are most concerned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Good organizations track this to determine if there's a larger underlying problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Utilizing Collected Data

In theory, the data collected from exit interviews allows companies to:
*   **Implement Corrective Actions:** Address identified trends, such as adjusting compensation or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Troubleshoot Managerial Styles:** If a manager is linked to high turnover, the company might investigate their style, potentially sending them for retraining or troubleshooting the reasons behind the high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Data Storage and Reporting
Information gathered from exit interviews may be saved to an employee's file or stored generically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Larger companies sometimes use third-party organizations to collect this data, which then generate reports at the end of the year for executive-level personnel to track trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

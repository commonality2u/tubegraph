This article aims to expose the [[characteristics_of_predatory_hiring_practices | characteristics of predatory hiring practices]] and low-quality employers to help job seekers avoid them in their search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The information is based on a specific example encountered on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## An Example of a Low-Quality Employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

A recruiting firm based in San Diego posted on LinkedIn, sparking controversy with its approach to hiring recruiters, especially those recently laid off or with less than one year of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. The post, from the CEO of the company, highlighted what job seekers are up against in today's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Red Flags and [[characteristics_of_predatory_hiring_practices | Predatory Practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>

The CEO's post and subsequent comments revealed several indicators of a low-quality employer:

*   **"Heart and Hustle" Culture**: The firm emphasized intangible qualities like "heart and hustle" as untrainable, suggesting a focus on a demanding work ethic over measurable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Working Interviews**: Candidates were subjected to "working interviews" where they were asked to perform actual work, including sourcing candidates for current openings, without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This is seen as exploiting vulnerable job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Unpaid Labor**: Any project that solves an actual business issue should be compensated, as it constitutes intellectual knowledge and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Expecting free work to prove "scrappiness" or "resourcefulness" is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Dangling a Carrot**: The employer used the prospect of landing an "amazing opportunity" in a tough market as justification for demanding unpaid work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. This represents [[misleading_promises_by_employers | misleading promises]] and leverages candidates' desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.
*   **100% Commission-Based Role**: The implied offer of a 100% commission-based job, with only the first commission paid before starting, is considered setting up a young, inexperienced candidate for "complete failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
*   **Demanding "Extra Mile"**: The CEO's statement, "We are looking for ones that are willing to go the extra mile," is a further red flag, indicating a toxic environment that expects candidates to jump through endless hoops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

### Gaslighting and Lack of Professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>

The CEO's responses to criticisms and interactions with candidates demonstrated significant gaslighting and unprofessional behavior:

*   **Blaming the Market**: The CEO rationalized her demands by stating, "This is a tough market right now," and that "it's no longer a straightforward path to an offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. This shifts blame from the employer's practices to the market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.
*   **Questioning Candidate's Character**: The CEO implied that candidates who don't comply lack "character" and are "not worthy," while ironically the CEO's own character is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Public Criticism of Candidates**: When a candidate respectfully withdrew from the process, the CEO publicly criticized her on LinkedIn, making it appear as though the candidate was the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.
*   **False Claims of Intent**: The CEO later claimed she "had every intention of moving forward to the offer stage" with the withdrawing candidate, trying to make the candidate feel at fault for "letting her down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.
*   **Narcissism**: The CEO's statements like "I'm giving them an opportunity to shine in a market where nobody else would hire them" exhibit an extreme level of narcissism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

### The Candidate's Response and What to Do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>

One candidate refused the working interview, citing that it was not "fair or in her best interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The speaker commended this candidate for valuing her time, energy, and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. She stood up for herself and publicly stated her qualities for other potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.

*   **Trust Your Gut**: It is crucial to trust your instincts when something feels wrong during an interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.
*   **Have Self-Respect**: Job seekers should have self-respect and avoid falling for [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory practices]] that demand unpaid work or excessive hoops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on High-Quality Employers**: Prioritize employers who respect candidates' time and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.
*   **Consider Alternatives**: Rather than enduring such conditions, individuals with tenacity might be better off pursuing freelance work or starting their own ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Red Flags for Employers
> If an employer demands "heart and hustle," unpaid "working interviews," dangles an unrealistic carrot, or expects you to "go the extra mile" without fair compensation, these are strong indicators of [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. Such companies often prey on desperate candidates in a difficult job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

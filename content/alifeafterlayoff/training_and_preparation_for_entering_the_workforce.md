Employers are facing significant challenges with recent college graduates, leading to high termination rates for Gen Z workers. This article explores the reasons behind these trends, based on a survey of business leaders, and offers insights into what employers expect from new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Employer Hesitancy and Termination Rates
A survey conducted by Intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders involved in hiring, revealed that one in six companies are hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
Of the companies surveyed:
*   75% reported having hired Gen Z workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   A "somewhat shocking" 6 out of 10 admitted to having fired a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

This indicates that companies are hiring Gen Z but are "not really putting up with what they perceive to be a cultural mismatch," and are terminating employment "relatively quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The trend suggests employers are "slow to hire, quick to fire," a pattern likely to continue as generations shift in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Key Issues Cited by Employers
According to the study, 75% of companies reported at least some issue with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The most frequently cited reasons for new hires not working out include:

*   **Lack of motivation or initiative**: 50% of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   **Lack of [[professionalism_and_preparedness_in_interviews | professionalism]]**: 46% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **Lack of organizational skills**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   **Lack of communication skills**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   **Challenges with feedback/not taking feedback well**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   **Lack of relevant work experience**: Mentioned, despite being entry-level roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   **Poor problem-solving skills**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **Insufficient technical skills**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   **Bad culture fit**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   **Difficulty working in a team**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

### Employer Beliefs About Recent College Graduates
Hiring managers also hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:
*   **Entitled**: 65-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This includes wanting quick promotions without demonstrated experience and high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Get offended easily**: 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of work ethic**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Doesn't respond well to feedback**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Unprepared for the workforce**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Poor communication skills**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Lack of motivation**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Costs more to train**: Mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of technological skill**: 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This is surprising given the generation's upbringing with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Additionally, employers report:
*   1 in 5 often can't manage workload and are unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   About 20% are often late to start and don't dress professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   19% often don't use appropriate language and are late to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   17% are often too difficult to manage and hand in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Consequence of Poor Habits
> Showing up to meetings or work late, and turning in assignments late, are described as the "fastest way to getting onto a performance improvement plan and being exited from the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Disconnect in [[challenges_of_transitioning_from_college_to_a_fulltime_job | Transitioning from College to a Fulltime Job]]
A significant concern is that universities and schools are "not preparing people for success in the modern workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. There is a "huge cultural disconnect" and clearly "not enough transition training to get people ready and acclimated for what the working world is like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This implies a lack of [[preparing_for_job_transition_steps | preparation for job transition steps]].

> [!INFO] Impact on Future Hiring
> As a result of these issues, one in seven companies may not even hire any college graduates in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. One out of six hiring managers is hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Case Studies and Real-World Examples
Comment sections and social media platforms like TikTok provide anecdotal evidence of these issues.

### Construction Company Owner's Perspective
A construction company owner in Southern California observed that problems are not limited to college grads, stating that "young people today with few exceptions are the most entitled and uneducated people I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Specific complaints included:
*   Complete lack of communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>
*   Zero critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   Devoid of motivation and require constant supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>
*   Zero attention to detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
*   Become frustrated at anything requiring persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
*   Refuse to separate themselves from their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, unable to focus for more than 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Emergency Department Nurse Graduate
A brand new nurse graduate in an emergency department would not stay off her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and was texting friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. When her phone was taken away, she had a "tantrum" and ultimately chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This led to the department stopping hiring new nurse grads, negatively impacting motivated individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Government IT Professional Experience
In the government sector, computer science graduates hired for entry-level IT admin positions all lasted less than six months due to similar issues: no focus, attention, communication skills, urgency, professionalism, and "social and professional dysfunction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### TikTok Termination Stories
Several Gen Z individuals on TikTok share stories of being fired. One individual recounted being fired from two accounting roles within the same year:
*   **First job**: Fired for being on her phone constantly because the role was "boring" and the company culture had "snitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Management eventually moved her desk in front of a manager's desk to monitor her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Second job**: Fired due to negative feedback from an "All-Star employee" who falsely reported her coming in "whenever I felt like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, despite her contract allowing flexible start times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. She acknowledged learning responsibility later and now works at an investment firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Another video shows an employee being terminated for consistent tardiness and a "no call no show" on her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Her lack of responsibility and inability to see an issue with her actions were highlighted as red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

A third example features an individual bragging about getting fired after "15 months" of "not doing anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, representing a "quiet quitting" mentality that employers are less likely to tolerate in the current job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

## What Employers Are Looking For
Employers are giving clear feedback on what they expect from new hires:
*   **Initiative and positive attitudes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
*   **Strong work ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   **Adaptability and openness to feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   **Punctuality and reliability** (not showing up late or disorganized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   **Solid technical skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   **Interpersonal skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   **Internship experience**: Recruiters "absolutely look for people who had internship experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Students are advised to pursue as many internship programs as possible, as early as possible in their degree program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Appropriate social media presence**: Employers search social media before hiring to ensure cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Sharing professional aspects rather than every personal detail is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Avoiding political topics**: Discussing politics can lead to termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

> [!TIP] Advice for Gen Z
> To succeed, Gen Z should "go above and beyond and do all the right things," focusing on "simple fundamental stuff" like being a good employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. This aligns with broader [[career_management_and_job_transitions | career management]] and [[effective_job_search_strategies_and_career_planning | job search strategies]].

## Nuance and Context
While data points to challenges with Gen Z, it's acknowledged that this is not a "blanket statement" for the entire generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Many "very motivated, very driven Gen Z employees" exist, as seen through [[career_coaching_and_resume_building_for_job_seekers | career coaching]] experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Every generation has received similar feedback upon entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

Gen Z deserves "a little bit of grace" as they are entering the workplace during "one of the most topsy-turvy and difficult job markets ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> and are often applying to thousands of positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. They are also driving positive changes, such as emphasizing work-life balance, which is a welcome development in what has become an "unhealthy and out of balance" workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Gen Z is expected to continue making inroads in improving workplace conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

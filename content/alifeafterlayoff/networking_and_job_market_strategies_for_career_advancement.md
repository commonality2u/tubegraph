It is important to look for a new job at least once every two years, even if you are satisfied in your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This approach encourages individuals to avoid complacency in their career and prevents the market from passing them by, both in terms of career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. To act as the CEO of your career, or as a "free agent," it is crucial to continually monitor the market and its trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Why the Market Passes You By

Staying in a job for too long often leads to the market surpassing your compensation and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Companies hiring new talent from outside the organization often offer significantly higher raises (10-20%) compared to internal promotions (5-10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. New hires, even with less experience, may make the same or more than long-tenured employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

Relying solely on small incremental cost-of-living adjustments (1-3% raises) can lead to wage stagnation, especially with inflation, effectively meaning you are making less money for the same job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Recruiters often find departments where employees are 20-30% below market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Employer Pay Philosophy

Companies generally follow one of two pay philosophies:
*   **Pay Leaders** – Aim to retain talent by paying competitively and can poach talent from other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggers** – Do not prioritize high retention and have built turnover into their business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

However, constant turnover can become more expensive due to recruiting costs, training, and the loss of institutional and tribal knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Testing the Open Market

Regularly testing the open market is a vital [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_gain_a_competitive_edge | strategy for career management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. At a minimum, every two years, you should:
1.  **Submit Applications** – Send out applications to potential opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
2.  **[[Networking for job opportunities | Network]] with Recruiters** – Connect with recruiters in your industry to stay informed about market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Go Through Interview Processes** – Participate in interviews to understand required skills and assessment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
4.  **Assess Compensation** – Aim to receive job offers to determine if you are underpaid relative to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

This helps you understand market trends and ensure you are being properly compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. If you fall too far behind, it can be impossible to catch up unless your company performs a major salary adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

While using an offer to leverage a counter-offer from your current employer can be effective, it should be done carefully and selectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. Continually doing so might lead your company to call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. A significant salary increase offered upon announcing your intent to leave often indicates you were underpaid to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

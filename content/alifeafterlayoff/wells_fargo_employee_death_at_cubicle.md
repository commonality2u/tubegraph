A 60-year-old Wells Fargo employee, Denise Prudhomme, was tragically found dead at her desk in a Tempe, Arizona, office building, four days after she had clocked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Incident Overview

Denise Prudhomme entered the Wells Fargo corporate office building on August 16th, a Friday, at 7:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It was not a branch office but a larger corporate location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. On August 20th, four days later, building security contacted officials regarding a "subject down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. An anonymous employee discovered Prudhomme dead in her cubicle while walking through the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead upon arrival at 4:55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, indicating she had likely been deceased for several days, including an entire weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Circumstances of Discovery

Prudhomme's cubicle was located on the third floor, away from the main aisle, described as being "tucked away somewhere off the beaten path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Despite the passage of four days, no one realized her absence. Multiple people reported a foul odor, but initially assumed it was due to plumbing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

One employee expressed heartbreak, questioning if anyone would check on them if they were in a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The thought of her spending her final moments at her desk, "filling out a TPS report that literally nobody took notice of and apparently nobody cared," deeply saddened others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Corporate Response and Workplace Culture

A Wells Fargo spokesman stated deep sadness over the tragic loss, extending thoughts and prayers to the family and offering counseling services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. They confirmed full cooperation with the police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. There was no indication of foul play, suggesting a health event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The incident highlights concerns about corporate culture, especially within the finance industry which often mandates employees return to the office for "collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The speaker questioned the lack of awareness from management, asking why no boss knew their employee was in the building but never left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The incident suggested a workplace environment where an individual could be "so invisible" that no one would notice their absence or check in on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Lessons and Reflections

The event serves as a somber reminder for individuals to prioritize their well-being and seek appreciation in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

> "The moral that I'm taking away from the story is is if you're working in a place that you're feeling very underappreciated go find a place that will value you go find a place that's going to notice when you're in the building and when you're producing the work that's the minimum that you should expect from a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

The speaker advises taking sick days and vacations, emphasizing that "you never know when your last day is going to be and hopefully it's not sitting in a cubicle somewhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The unfortunate reality is that "you're just a cog in a wheel a number on a spreadsheet and people will not even notice you if you expire at work in a lot of cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This event underscores the importance of individuals [[company_and_employee_mixups | reclaiming control of their careers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

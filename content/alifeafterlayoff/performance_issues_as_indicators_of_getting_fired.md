Are you questioning your job security? Certain performance-related issues can serve as [[signs_of_potential_termination_at_work | indicators that your job might be in jeopardy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. With twenty years of experience in human resources and recruiting for major corporations, witnessing many terminations, the speaker identifies several "sure signs that your job is potentially on the rocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Recognizing these signs should prompt you to consider a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Declining Performance Metrics

A primary "leading indicator" that your job is at risk is when your [[performance_metrics_and_probationary_periods | performance metrics are significantly down]], especially compared to your co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. In large corporations, departments often publish metrics, such as sales quotas or other measurable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If your productivity is noticeably behind the rest of the group, your name is likely on a list somewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Underperforming compared to your peers is a strong signal that you either need to focus on improving your performance or reevaluate if the role is the right fit for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Consistent lower output will inevitably draw the attention of your direct manager and their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Sudden Displeasure from Your Boss

Another significant indicator is if your boss suddenly becomes displeased with your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. In such a scenario, it's crucial to identify what you're doing that isn't meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Being proactive by meeting with your boss to clarify expectations and request support can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Continually displeasing your boss can result in a "target on your back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This can also be a [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | sign of quiet firing]].

## Work Redistribution and Exclusion

If your work is being redistributed, such as clients or projects you once handled being taken away, it's a clear [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | sign]] that you are not meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This indicates that faith in your ability to perform the position has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. You may also notice you are no longer invited to key discussions or meetings that you previously attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. When your boss starts interjecting or taking your place in meetings, it's often to do damage control or to distance you from projects and teams you supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This "weirdness" with groups you support, especially cross-functional leaders acting strangely or withholding information, suggests a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Drastically Lowered Performance Appraisals

A significant red flag is when your [[performance_metrics_and_probationary_periods | performance appraisals]] suddenly slip drastically, especially if you have a history of decent scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. A much lower, highly critical appraisal that catches you off guard is a warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### The HR Perspective: Documentation

From an HR perspective, a manager who wants to dismiss an underperforming employee will first have their employment file reviewed, including past performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. HR professionals aim to limit liability by ensuring a paper trail of performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. If an employee goes from a documented good history to suddenly not meeting expectations, it can appear to be a rash decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Therefore, HR will often push managers to start documenting coaching sessions and reflect performance declines in appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This documentation is a deliberate process to build a paper trail to defend an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Performance Improvement Process (PIP)

As a last resort for performance-related issues, HR departments typically place an employee on a Performance Improvement Process (PIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

> "The performance improvement process is a defined period of time with measurable goals that must be hit in order for you to keep your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

If you fail to meet the "very defined" metrics set forth in the PIP, termination is the likely outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, if you take the PIP seriously and successfully improve your performance, you can come off the PIP and return to the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. At that point, it's your responsibility to elevate your performance to meet the group's standards and move past the poor performance period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Being placed on a PIP is a major red flag that should be taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Taking Action

If you notice any of these [[signs_of_potential_termination_at_work | signs]], you should start thinking about your next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Whether you aim to address the performance issues or pursue a change, it will require concerted effort and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The crucial first step is to take action, either to salvage the situation or to "cut bait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

A steady job, while seemingly desirable, can be detrimental to your career if not approached proactively. Traditional values of loyalty and stability, ingrained in many before entering the workforce, can sometimes hinder [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_advancement | career progression]] if not balanced with [[taking_ownership_of_your_career | taking ownership of your career]] [00:00:00] [00:00:03] [00:00:29].

## The Story of Joe: The Average Candidate

Joe began his career as an entry-level accountant and eventually obtained a CPA, hoping to lead a team someday [00:00:49] [00:00:55] [00:00:58]. He received steady reviews and modest merit increases, occasionally taking on projects [00:01:02] [00:01:06] [00:01:10].

However, when his boss, who had hired him, left the organization, Joe hoped to be considered for the role and even applied [00:01:16] [00:01:22] [00:01:24]. Despite being recognized as a solid "worker bee," the organization did not see him as having leadership potential and hired externally [00:01:29] [00:01:32] [00:01:37].

Feeling deflated, Joe continued in his role, justifying his compensation by benefits like 401k vesting, vacation time, and bonuses, even as new, less experienced hires earned only slightly less than him [00:01:42] [00:01:57] [00:02:00] [00:02:03].

At the 10-year mark, rumors of downsizing began [00:02:13] [00:02:20]. Joe felt secure, believing his long tenure and knowledge made him valuable and next in line for a promotion [00:02:25] [00:02:28] [00:02:32].

However, Joe was laid off [00:02:36] [00:02:41]. He realized that his years of loyalty and "paying dues" ultimately hurt him, as peers in other companies had already achieved the promotions he sought, leaving him years behind [00:02:46] [00:03:04] [00:03:07].

Joe is an "average candidate"â€”steady but unspectacular, possessing skills but lacking aggression [00:03:24] [00:03:27] [00:03:37]. He waited for opportunities rather than actively pursuing them, a common trait that causes candidates to "blend into the crowd" when competing for roles [00:03:39] [00:03:41] [00:03:49] [00:04:06].

## The Story of Jill: The Superstar Candidate

Jill started her career at the same time as Joe in an entry-level accounting role [00:04:15] [00:04:18] [00:04:21]. Early on, she knew she wanted to lead a team in finance and began to create a [[the_importance_of_career_planning | master plan]] [00:04:25] [00:04:27] [00:04:29].

Her proactive steps included:
*   **Obtaining Certifications:** She immediately pursued her CPA after starting her first position [00:04:32] [00:04:35].
*   **Seeking Project Experience:** She identified projects to improve her department and presented them to her manager, gaining more responsibility [00:04:40] [00:04:45] [00:04:48] [00:04:52].
*   **Networking for Visibility:** Jill networked with other departmental heads, gaining invitations to project groups and spreading her name within the company [00:04:57] [00:05:01] [00:05:04].

Jill soon earned a promotion to a team lead role with a salary increase, gaining leadership experience [00:05:11] [00:05:15]. However, she recognized that her boss was a "lifer" who would block her upward mobility within the company [00:05:17] [00:05:20] [00:05:24].

At an industry event, Jill openly discussed feeling blocked and her intention to seek a new role [00:05:35] [00:05:43]. Within months, her network connected her to a position at a major corporation that offered a 30% pay bump and the leadership role she desired [00:05:48] [00:05:52] [00:05:55] [00:05:58] [00:06:00]. This move was a "no-brainer" as it aligned perfectly with her desired [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | career trajectory]] [00:06:04] [00:06:08] [00:06:10].

In just three years, Jill surpassed Joe in terms of level, experience, and compensation [00:06:12] [00:06:14] [00:06:15]. She exemplifies a "superstar candidate" who is aggressive, knows what she wants, and prioritizes [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | career goals]] over mere job stability [00:06:29] [00:06:31] [00:06:36] [00:06:38] [00:06:40].

## The Importance of Being a Free Agent

<div class="callout">
[!NOTE]
You need to ask yourself what are your [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | career goals]]? If you're new to your career or even if you're mid-career and you don't have a clearly defined path, that's something that you need to figure out [00:06:51] [00:06:53] [00:06:57] [00:06:58].
</div>

Without clear [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | career goals]], you risk moving through "uninspired roles and job progressions that just don't make sense," becoming an "average Joe" [00:07:01] [00:07:02] [00:07:04] [00:07:05]. Proactively defining your goals means every career move is targeted, helping you avoid wasting time on "non-value-added positions" [00:07:22] [00:07:24] [00:07:25] [00:07:30] [00:07:32].

Think of yourself as a "free agent" [00:07:35]. Like professional athletes, free agents offer their services to the team that provides the best opportunity, constantly honing their skills to increase their market value and secure top opportunities and compensation [00:07:36] [00:07:38] [00:07:41] [00:07:44] [00:07:47] [00:07:49]. You are in control of your career [00:08:03] [00:08:05].

### Cultivating Transferable Skills

Honing your skills, particularly "career skills," are assets you take with you from employer to employer [00:08:08] [00:08:10] [00:08:15]. You don't owe a company anything more than a fair effort for fair pay [00:08:17] [00:08:18]. Since you don't have an agent, you must create your own opportunities [00:08:22] [00:08:24].

### Calculated Career Progression vs. Job Hopping

This approach doesn't mean changing jobs every time an opportunity is missed or things don't go your way [00:08:26] [00:08:27] [00:08:28]. It's crucial to learn your position, develop required skills, network, and understand company culture for your [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_advancement | career growth]] [00:08:30] [00:08:32] [00:08:33] [00:08:35] [00:08:37] [00:08:38].

However, if you're genuinely ready for the next step and your current company isn't providing the opportunity, it's a sign to update your resume [00:08:44] [00:08:46] [00:08:47] [00:08:49] [00:08:50].

<div class="callout">
[!TIP]
A person who leaves a role for a very calculated [[the_importance_of_career_planning | career progression]] is not going to be perceived as a job hopper, especially if that's a calculated move [00:09:01] [00:09:03] [00:09:06] [00:09:07]. Recruiters understand that a company might not offer the right opportunities or mentorship for your development [00:09:08] [00:09:09] [00:09:11] [00:09:14] [00:09:16].
</div>

Ensure every position you accept has a strong and clear purpose, even if it's a lateral move [00:09:22] [00:09:24] [00:09:25] [00:09:27] [00:09:29].

### Salary and Compensation

While salary is a primary reason for working, make sure you add value, and income will follow [00:09:31] [00:09:33] [00:09:34] [00:09:43] [00:09:45]. Stay current on salary trends in your market to ensure fair compensation, and don't hesitate to ask for a raise if you have performance data to back it up [00:09:47] [00:09:49] [00:09:50] [00:09:52] [00:09:54] [00:09:55].

It's an unfortunate fact that staying in the same company and position for too long almost certainly means you will lag behind the market [00:09:57] [00:09:58] [00:10:00] [00:10:02]. Most companies provide annual merit increases of only 1-3%, whereas a promotion or moving to a new company for a promotional opportunity can result in a 10-30% pay bump [00:10:05] [00:10:06] [00:10:07] [00:10:09] [00:10:10] [00:10:13] [00:10:15] [00:10:17] [00:10:19]. The open market will surpass you if you stay too long, unless you receive substantial internal raises [00:10:38] [00:10:40] [00:10:41] [00:10:43] [00:10:44].

## Should You Stay in Your Steady Job?

If you prioritize a steady paycheck over [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_advancement | career growth]], there's nothing wrong with that [00:10:48] [00:10:49] [00:10:51] [00:10:52]. However, if you're stuck in an under-compensated role or blocked from your ultimate [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | career goals]], it's time to reconsider [00:10:55] [00:10:56] [00:10:58] [00:11:00].

Proactive individuals who actively pursue opportunities will succeed faster and reach their [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | career goals]] more quickly [00:11:02] [00:11:03] [00:11:05] [00:11:07] [00:11:08]. Additionally, being a "superstar candidate" makes you less likely to face unemployment [00:11:10] [00:11:12] [00:11:14].

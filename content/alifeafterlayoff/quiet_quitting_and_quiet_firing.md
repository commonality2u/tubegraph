The employment landscape has seen several significant shifts in recent years, moving through trends like the Great Resignation, [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quitting]], and [[quiet_firing_signs | quiet firing]], leading to the latest trend, career cushioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These trends reflect a changing dynamic between employers and employees, often influenced by economic conditions.

## The Evolution of Employment Trends

The period leading up to these trends began with a major economic downturn in 2020 due due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Many employers had a "knee-jerk reaction" and laid off numerous employees, which had a ripple effect on the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Remaining employees were burdened with additional work, facing long hours and stress under the pervasive mantra of "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Employers also demanded more while cutting expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

This led to widespread burnout among employees, causing them to reevaluate their priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Displaced workers reflected on years of work for companies that unceremoniously showed them the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Those who remained questioned if their work was truly what they wanted to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This environment set the stage for the first major employment trend: the Great Resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

During the Great Resignation, the pendulum of power swung strongly towards the job seeker, creating an "extreme job seeker buyer market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This was a "Heyday of job seeking," where opportunities were abundant, and people frequently received raises or left jobs for better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Some individuals even left stable positions to pursue riskier opportunities for better paychecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## [[quiet_quitting_explained | Quiet Quitting]]

In this booming labor market, some employees who did not leave their jobs began to consider [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This phenomenon emerged among individuals who were burnt out but chose not to leave their current employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The risk of adverse consequences for scaling back their efforts was not threatening because of the abundance of job opportunities available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The concept of [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quitting]] has often been associated with negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## [[quiet_firing_signs | Quiet Firing]]

Following the period of [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quitting]], the labor market pendulum began to shift back towards a more neutral position, allowing employers to regain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. As hiring started to slow down, employers began to examine their workforces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This led to the emergence of [[quiet_firing_signs | quiet firing]], a concept where employers aim to encourage an employee to quit rather than initiating an outright termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

As of December 2022, the labor market remains shaky and is trending towards uncertainty, with the pendulum seemingly swinging further towards the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. While the overall labor market still shows signs of strength, certain industries, like tech, have been severely impacted by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Studies indicate that companies are "right-sizing" their workforces, with 50% of surveyed executives planning to reduce headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This includes hiring freezes, reduced headcounts, and the discontinuation of sign-on bonuses and perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Furthermore, 44% of companies are rescinding job offers or canceling positions altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

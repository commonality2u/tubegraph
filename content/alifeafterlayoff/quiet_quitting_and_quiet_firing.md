## Evolution of Employment Trends

The employment market has seen several distinct trends in recent years, evolving from a period of employee empowerment to one where employers are regaining influence. These trends include the [[great_resignation_extension | Great Resignation]], followed by [[quiet_quitting_concept | quiet quitting]], and then [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | quiet firing]], ultimately leading to career cushioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Great Resignation Context
The shift began around 2020 following a major economic downturn caused by the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Many employers made knee-jerk reactions, laying off employees who perhaps shouldn't have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This resulted in remaining employees taking on significant additional work burdens and facing a "you should just be happy to have a job" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

This period led to widespread burnout and a reevaluation of life priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Both displaced workers and those who remained began questioning their careers, leading to the phenomenon of the [[great_resignation_extension | Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The pendulum of power swung strongly towards the job seeker, creating a "Heyday of job seeking" where opportunities were abundant, and raises were common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Quiet Quitting

As the job market boomed during the [[great_resignation_extension | Great Resignation]], some employees who chose not to leave their jobs began to consider [[quiet_quitting_concept | quiet quitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. These individuals were often burned out but preferred to stay in their current roles, partly because the abundance of job opportunities reduced the perceived risk of scaling back their effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that there is considerable negativity associated with the [[quiet_quitting_concept | quiet quitting]] concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Quiet Firing

Following the [[quiet_quitting_concept | quiet quitting]] trend, the market began to shift, and the pendulum of power started swinging back towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Hiring started to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. In this environment, employers began to implement [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | quiet firing]], a concept where they encourage an employee to quit rather than outright firing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

As of December 2022, the labor market continued to be shaky, with the pendulum seemingly swinging further towards the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While the overall labor market still showed signs of strength, certain industries, like tech, experienced significant layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives indicated that 50% were reducing their overall headcount, even while expressing concerns about hiring and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Companies were observed instituting hiring freezes, reducing headcount, lowering or dropping sign-on bonuses, and even rescinding job offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. These indicators suggest a potentially rocky 2023 for the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

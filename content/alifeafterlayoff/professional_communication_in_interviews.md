Effective communication during a job interview is crucial for a successful outcome, as saying or not saying certain things can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Recruiters emphasize that careful communication can help you avoid ending up in the "no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## What to Avoid Saying or Asking

Certain questions or statements can give a negative impression, suggesting a lack of [[interview_preparation_and_selfpresentation | preparation]] or an undesirable attitude.

### Lack of Research and Understanding

*   **"What does the company do?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   Asking this question demonstrates a significant lack of [[strategies_for_preparing_for_job_interviews | preparation]] and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Candidates are expected to have performed basic research on the company's core business, products, divisions, competitors, and recent technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Understanding the company's mission, vision, and values is also essential to ensure cultural alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **"What is the role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
    *   Inquiring about the role's basic functions suggests that you have not thoroughly read the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Companies seek problem-solvers who take initiative, not individuals who require constant guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Inappropriate Inquiries About Work Conditions

*   **"What are the hours?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
    *   For salaried non-exempt professional positions, asking about hours can brand you as a "clock watcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While concerns about work-life balance are valid, it's advisable to rephrase the question.
    *   **Instead, ask about:** The company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, expectations for the first 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, or the specific shift you would support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Focus on Personal Gain Over Contribution

*   **Directly asking about promotional opportunities (e.g., "When will I get the boss's job?")** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
    *   This implies a lack of interest in the current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   **Instead, ask about:** General career paths and long-term growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, while emphasizing excitement for the immediate role and a desire to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

*   **Asking about salary too early** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
    *   Bringing up salary at the start of the interview is a turn-off, as it suggests compensation is your primary motivation before understanding the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Allow the recruiter to initiate this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   Avoid asking the hiring manager about pay ranges, as salary discussions are typically handled by HR or the talent acquisition team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

*   **Not knowing your salary expectations when asked** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
    *   Failing to provide a clear answer or attempting to defer the question shows unpreparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. You should have a desired salary range in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Negative and Unprofessional Attitudes

*   **Speaking poorly about previous companies or bosses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
    *   Interviewers are focused on assessing your fit for *their* company, not on listening to complaints about past employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This reflects poorly on your [[professionalism_in_workplace_interactions | professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   **Instead:** Be gracious, highlight lessons learned, and express genuine interest in the new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Stating how nervous you are** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
    *   While some nervousness is expected, dwelling on it can hurt your impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Recruiters may offer "softball questions" to help ease nerves, but eventually, you are expected to demonstrate confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Be well-prepared to confidently present yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Being too casual** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
    *   While some looseness can break the ice, excessive casualness or "colorful language" can be offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. An interview is a professional setting, not a social one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   **Avoid:** Using terms like "boss" or "bro," as they can be considered derogatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   **Instead:** Keep interactions polished and professional to make a favorable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Default to whatever name the interviewer introduces themselves with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## What to Do: Asking Questions

*   **Not [[asking_questions_to_interviewers | asking questions]] at the end of the interview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
    *   When an interviewer asks if you have questions, a lack of inquiries shows disinterest or a lack of awareness about your potential fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   **Instead:** Come prepared with a list of well-thought-out, intelligent questions about the company, culture, and how you might contribute to the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This demonstrates engagement in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

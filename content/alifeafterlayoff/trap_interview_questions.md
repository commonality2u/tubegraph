Interviewing can be challenging, but some questions are designed as traps that can undermine your chances if you're not prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These questions might seem simple on the surface, but a misstep can significantly impact your job prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Brian Kley, a corporate recruiter with experience interviewing thousands of people and working with hiring managers, aims to demystify these traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

This guide breaks down seven common trap interview questions and provides [[strategies_for_answering_common_interview_questions | strategies]] to dodge them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Interview Traps

### 1. "Why did you leave your last job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>

This seemingly innocent question tests your professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **The Trap**: A negative answer can make you look bad, especially if you were fired, experienced workplace drama, or have a history of quitting with little notice or frequently changing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Bashing a former employer or spilling excessive details is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   Stay positive and remember that "less is more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
    *   Focus on what you gained or sought in your career development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. For example, you might state a desire to grow skills in a specific area like leadership that your previous role didn't offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
    *   If you were laid off, mention it briefly without dwelling on perceived unfairness, and then pivot to why you are excited about the current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   Keep it professional and focus on why you are a great fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### 2. "What's your biggest weakness?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>

This is a classic trap with two main issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **The Trap**: Interviewers want to assess your self-awareness and willingness to "own up" to a weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. They also want to see if the weakness you provide aligns poorly with the job's core requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. For instance, stating you're not detail-oriented for a precision-required job makes you a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   Avoid saying you have no weaknesses, as it appears arrogant and insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
    *   Do not use clichés like "I work too hard" or "I care too much" – these are seen as cop-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   Choose a genuine weakness that is *not* a deal-breaker for the specific job you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
    *   Before the interview, check the company's core values to ensure your chosen weakness doesn't clash with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. For example, Amazon's leadership principles were critical, and answers that contradicted them would lead to not being hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
    *   After stating a relatively safe weakness, demonstrate how you have addressed or improved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. For a team lead position, you could say you used to struggle with delegating but learned to trust your team and distribute workload, which boosted productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
    *   Be honest and show growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### 3. "Where do you see yourself in five years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>

*   **The Trap**: Your stated goals must align with the hiring manager's expectations for the role's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
    *   If the role is part of a succession plan and you express a desire to start a business, you'll seem uncommitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
    *   Stating "I'm here to take your job" can offend the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   Having no plan at all makes you look lost or unmotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   Tie your goals to those of the company and the specific job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
    *   An example response: "Ideally, I will have learned this job completely and be exceeding my expectations, and in five years, hopefully, will be on a leadership career path while continuing to help the company's goals and building my leadership competency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This demonstrates ambition and long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
    *   Be truthful. Don't simply provide a generic answer if you're not genuinely interested in the path (e.g., leadership) they expect, as it could lead to a career mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
    *   This is a question you should not "wing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### 4. "Tell me about a time when you failed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>

This is an obvious setup designed to assess how you handle setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **The Trap**: Blaming others or choosing a significant failure (e.g., costing the company a million dollars) will make you appear unreliable or incompetent, leading to defensive probing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   Select a relatively small failure that didn't have huge stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
    *   Own the failure and demonstrate how you learned from it, showing improvement and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This approach is more likely to impress the hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

### 5. "What's your current salary?" or "What are your salary expectations?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>

This question can be a trap to lock you into a lower offer or scare them off with high expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
*   **The Trap**: Sharing your current salary can lead to a lowball offer, or you might leave money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. A high expectation might scare them away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. While some states ban the question about current salary, it still appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   For "What's your current salary?", deflect and focus on the role's value, putting it back on the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
    *   For "What are your salary expectations?", respond strategically:
        1.  Ask them to share their range first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
        2.  If they insist you answer first, provide your minimum acceptable salary plus an additional 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
        3.  Crucially, conduct thorough salary research before the interview and be realistic about your skills and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
    *   You own your salary worth and should control it, being prepared to walk away from a lowball offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
    *   Avoid completely dodging the question, as employers may put your application in a rejected status or limbo until a number is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. They generally won't put you in front of hiring teams if salary expectations are vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

### 6. "What do you know about our job/company?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>

This often occurs at the beginning of an interview and is not merely an icebreaker; it's a serious interview question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **The Trap**: It's a test to see if you've done your homework and have a genuine interest beyond just interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Not knowing about the role or company makes you appear lazy or disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   Research the company's mission and understand the role's responsibilities thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Read through the job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   Show genuine interest, especially to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
    *   Example: "I know that the company focuses on [such and such goal], they've just launched [this new product], and this particular role supports [such and such division] with [these key responsibilities]. I think I've got a pretty good understanding, but I'm happy for you to elaborate on anything that I might be missing. I'm really excited about this position because of [such and such reason]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   Asking timely questions can help establish a dominant frame in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### 7. "Why do you want to work here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>

While the truth might be "I need a job," honesty won't secure the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **The Trap**: They're looking for reasons beyond just a paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Many candidates fail by making it about themselves instead of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Remember, they are the buyer shopping for talent, and you are the seller of your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   Tie your answer into what the company is trying to solve with that job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   Show them you are the best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
    *   Example: "I admire your company's focus on [such and such value], and I feel that based on the product or service you're offering/delivering, I would be a great fit because of X, Y, and Z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
    *   Demonstrate passion, alignment, and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

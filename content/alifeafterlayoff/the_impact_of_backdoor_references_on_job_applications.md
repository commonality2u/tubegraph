Backdoor references are a method employers might use to gather information about a job candidate from sources not provided by the candidate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This practice can significantly impact a candidate's job application, potentially leading to disqualification or even blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

## What is a Backdoor Reference?
A backdoor reference occurs when someone on a hiring team at a prospective company knows or contacts someone who previously worked with the job candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The hiring team member then reaches out to this contact to ask for their opinion on the candidate, even if the candidate did not list them as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

## How Backdoor References Impact Applications
Backdoor references have been observed to "sink more than one candidate's chances at an opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. They can potentially lead to a candidate being [[strategies_for_managing_job_applications_and_avoiding_blacklisting | blacklisted]] altogether from an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Transparency Issues
> Candidates are unlikely to ever know if a backdoor reference has been used against them, as these interactions typically happen behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Prevalence
While their exact frequency is hard to gauge, backdoor references are known to occur, particularly in smaller industries where professional networks are tighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Therefore, job seekers should be mindful of their professional relationships and how they leave previous employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

In the workplace, it's crucial to be extremely careful about what you disclose to coworkers, as loose lips can lead to significant trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A former HR professional has compiled a list of common disclosures that have caused issues for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Being mindful of these points can help you maintain your job and stay out of the "doghouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Avoid Discussing Your Job Search
It's advisable not to tell coworkers if you are actively looking for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. News of a job search can spread rapidly through workplace whispers, eventually reaching your boss, senior leaders, or the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. If you want to keep your job search confidential from your current employer, also exercise extreme caution when updating and uploading your resume to public databases like Indeed or LinkedIn, especially if it indicates your current company or role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Disclosing this information can potentially accelerate your departure from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This falls under [[personal_information_to_avoid_sharing_in_interviews | personal information to avoid sharing in interviews]] and [[consequences_of_oversharing_at_work | consequences of oversharing at work]].

## Refrain from Negative Comments and Gossip
Do not speak negatively about your boss, regardless of how you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even if you have a work confidant who also complains about the boss, be cautious in your engagement, as such comments often come back to negatively affect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Similarly, avoid [[gossip_and_negative_comments_at_work | gossiping about other coworkers]] in your department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Developing a reputation as a gossip is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. If coworkers discover you are talking about them behind their back, they may file a complaint or report it to management, drawing unwanted attention to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Despite your carefulness or the closeness of your confidant, your boss often finds out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[navigating_coworker_relationships | navigating coworker relationships]] carefully.

## Be Cautious About Salary Disclosure
While salary transparency is generally beneficial for creating a level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, sharing your salary within your current company is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. If coworkers share their salaries, someone in the group may discover they are underpaid and become upset, potentially leading them to quit or demand higher compensation from the boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This can cause the boss to lose trust in those who disclosed their salaries, even if there are legitimate reasons for pay differences (e.g., skill, experience, or changes in the job market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Losing trust can hinder your chances of promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

For salary transparency, use anonymous platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind (for tech professionals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These platforms allow you to share salary information anonymously, helping others understand fair compensation for roles without personal blowback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Avoid Borrowing Money from Coworkers
It is strongly advised not to borrow money from coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Similar to the adage about family or friends, engaging in financial transactions or business ventures with coworkers often leads to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Requesting money can put a coworker in an uncomfortable position, potentially leading them to report the incident to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Be Mindful of Compliments on Physical Attributes
Complimenting coworkers on their physical attributes, even if you intend it innocently, should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. How a compliment is perceived by the recipient is what matters, not your intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Many HR complaints arise from coworkers feeling uncomfortable due to such comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While a professional compliment on a new haircut or outfit (e.g., "That hairdo looks great on you") might be acceptable, ensure it remains professional and not "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Do Not Comment on Coworker's Potential Pregnancy
Never assume or call out a coworker's potential pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The two likely outcomes are that they are not ready to disclose it, forcing them to expedite the announcement, or they are not pregnant, leading to offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Let the individual take the lead in disclosing such personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Keep Legal Issues Private
If you are involved in a major employee relations issue or considering legal action against the company, do not discuss it with coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Spilling details about your case, alleged illegal activities, or legal strategy could provide the company with information to defend themselves proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. If you are pursuing litigation, confide only in your attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Avoid Off-Color Jokes
Refrain from telling off-color jokes to coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Jokes perceived as innocent by the teller can be interpreted as offensive by the recipient, leading to frequent complaints to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Your intention does not negate the impact of how the joke is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It's best to stick to lighthearted "dad jokes" or minimize joking altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Steer Clear of Political Discussions
It is increasingly difficult but important to avoid political discussions in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Regardless of your political leanings, bringing up political topics is likely to offend someone and lead to arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. To protect your career and avoid legal trouble, maintain a high degree of professionalism with coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. While being friendly is fine, be very careful about what you say and disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

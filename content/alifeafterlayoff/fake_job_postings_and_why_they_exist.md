A significant number of job postings circulating are [[fake_job_postings | fake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This phenomenon has been observed by recruiters, with specific instances where hiring managers requested positions to be published without any intention of filling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Reasons for Fake Job Postings

Several reasons contribute to the existence of these misleading job advertisements:

*   **Talent Acquisition Strategy** Some companies, especially those adhering to "old school" talent acquisition methods, post jobs to collect applications for potential future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The idea is to build a "slate of candidates" for when a position might open six to nine months down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This approach often disregards candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, as candidates typically find other employment during such long waiting periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **"Fishing" for Ideal Candidates** Hiring managers may post job requisitions simply to see if an "absolute perfect fit" candidate might surface, even if there's no immediate intent to hire for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. In such cases, applicants go through unnecessary hoops for a very slim chance of even receiving a phone call, let alone an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

These practices contribute to a difficult job market where job seekers often feel they are struggling with their search and may internalize issues, believing something is wrong with them, when often it's a competition issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

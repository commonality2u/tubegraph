When in a job search without much success, individuals may consider whether [[the_pitfalls_of_contract_offers_over_full_time_positions|going the contract route]] is the right decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores the advantages and disadvantages of contract versus full-time employment.

## Initial Perceptions and Stigma

Many job seekers tend to avoid contract positions, viewing them as lower quality, and a stigma is often associated with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. There's a common feeling that a contract position is merely temporary, not a full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. After a long and frustrating job search, some may reach a point where they consider contract positions more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Recruiters' and Career Coach's Perspective

A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience in interviewing and hiring thousands of people offers insights into how [[recruiters_perspective_on_contract_positions|recruiters look at contracting]] and how job seekers should view these roles from a career coach's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Pros of Contract Positions

### 1. More Readily Available Work
Contract positions are often more abundant, especially in uncertain economic climates, such as during a pandemic when companies are apprehensive about adding permanent headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This means a higher likelihood of being considered for a contract role due to their prevalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### 2. Opportunity to Demonstrate Skills and Reduce Employer Risk
Contract roles provide an opportunity to showcase skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For employers, offering a contract position involves less risk, especially when considering a candidate who might be a "stretch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Hiring managers, who are often risk-averse because they "live with the headcount," may use contracting as a strategy to assess a candidate's fit before committing to a full-time conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This approach allows a candidate to prove their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. It's advisable to ask during an interview if there's a likelihood of conversion to full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### 3. Career Pivoting and Skill Acquisition
Contracting allows individuals to pivot into a new industry, job type, or gain a new skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For instance, it can help someone with a manufacturing background gain experience in healthcare to bridge a resume gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This is a strategic way to fill skill gaps on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### 4. Income Continuation
Contract positions can bridge the gap in income while actively searching for a full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This can be crucial since job searches often last six to nine months, or even up to a year in some markets, and most people don't have sufficient savings to cover such periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Having a steady income makes the job search process easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### 5. "Test Drive" for the Employee
Just as a company can "test drive" an employee, a contract position allows the employee to "test drive" the company, work environment, and team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If the work environment, type of work, or co-workers are not a good fit, an individual can exit the contract as easily as the company can terminate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### 6. Confidence Boost After Layoff
For those who have experienced a layoff, a contract position can help rebuild confidence, get them back into the workforce, and establish a routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It can be a good way to start healing from an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### 7. Potentially Higher Hourly Pay
In many cases, contract positions can offer a higher hourly rate compared to the equivalent full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Some individuals earn enough to take extended breaks each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Cons of Contract Positions

### 1. "Hopping Resume" Perception
A significant issue for career contractors seeking full-time roles is the perception of a "hopping resume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Hiring managers often express concern when a candidate has a history of short-term engagements (six, eight, nine months, or a year at each place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This can suggest a lack of commitment to long-term projects, inability to see things through, or difficulty in building relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is particularly relevant for younger professionals who might face a bias or misconception about their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Benefits
In most cases, contract positions do not offer benefits like health insurance, paid time off, or retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. While some agencies might offer benefits, they are usually inferior to those provided by large corporations for their full-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This directly relates to the [[financial_and_lifestyle_implications_of_contracting|financial and lifestyle implications of contracting]].

### 3. Sense of Limbo and Instability
Being on contract can create a feeling of limbo, as if one's life is on pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. There is no sense of relief, as one must continue to look for positions and plan for what happens after the contract ends, especially if it doesn't convert to full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This lack of stable income can weigh heavily on major life events like buying a house or starting a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### 4. Lack of Employer Commitment and Loyalty
Contractors are aware that the employer is not fully committed to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. There are generally no clear career opportunities or paths for advancement within the company, other than the possibility of conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This absence of loyalty or commitment from the employer can be disheartening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### 5. Feeling of Not Belonging to the Team
A contract employee may feel that they do not truly belong to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. When discussions turn to future plans or long-term projects, contractors often feel that they likely won't be around to see them through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This can lead to a sense of detachment from the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This can impact the [[impact_of_contracting_on_career_perception_and_resume|career perception]].

## Conclusion
Deciding between a contract and a full-time position requires weighing the pros and cons based on personal preference, the local job market, and how frequently job offers are being received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. While contracting can make a lot of sense for many, its negatives must also be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

Applying for numerous jobs can lead to increased exposure of your personal information, raising significant [[importance_of_privacy_in_job_searching | data privacy concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## How Personal Data is Used and Shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>

When you apply for jobs, your personal information is submitted to a variety of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This data is often used by potential employers to conduct background checks and verify your employment history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

However, a significant concern arises because this personal data is frequently shared with third parties, such as data brokers, who then resell the information, causing it to appear across the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Indicators of Compromised Information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

Receiving an increased number of robocalls or spam emails can be an indicator that your personal information may have been compromised during the job application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Services like Delete Me offer a solution to help manage and protect your personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. They scan the internet for instances where your personal data appears on public directories and proactively take steps to automatically remove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

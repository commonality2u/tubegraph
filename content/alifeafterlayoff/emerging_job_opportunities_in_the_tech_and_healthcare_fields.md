This article explores various self-reported salaries from different professions, highlighting particular opportunities in the tech and healthcare fields based on recent data. The salaries discussed are self-reported on Reddit, so they should be taken with a "grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.

## Opportunities in the Tech Sector

The technology sector continues to offer high-paying roles, particularly in sales and engineering.

### Software Sales
Software sales, especially in Software as a Service (SaaS), can yield significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:46">[05:01:46]</a>. One self-reported example shows a base salary of \$110,000 with an additional \$110,000 in bonus, totaling approximately \$210,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:41">[04:24:41]</a>. Commissions in software sales can be very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:01">[04:52:01]</a>.

### Software Engineer
While a reported salary for a software engineer was \$133,000 per year, this figure might be considered low for a seasoned professional, with expected base salaries ranging from \$150,000 to \$170,000 at a reasonably sized company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Total compensation can be much higher due to bonuses and stock incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>.

### Ad Sales (Google)
An individual selling ads on Google reported a base salary of \$185,000, with total compensation reaching \$415,000 last year including quarterly bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:04">[09:16:04]</a>.

### Video Game Bug Tester and Finder
An unconventional but highly lucrative role is that of a professional video game bug tester and finder. This role involves playing video games to identify and report bugs to development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:21">[13:25:21]</a>. Compensation is based on the quantity and significance of bugs found, with one tester reporting earning up to \$2,000 per bug and an annual income of approximately \$360,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:11">[13:36:11]</a>. This is described as a "serious income" for playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:07">[13:53:07]</a>.

## Opportunities in the Healthcare Sector

The healthcare sector also presents compelling career paths, particularly with the recent demand changes.

### Dental Assistant
A dental assistant reported earning \$30 per hour, equating to about \$62,500 annually before overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:03">[05:18:03]</a>. With overtime, this could increase to the \$70,000 to \$75,000 range, without requiring dental school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### Travel Nurse
The profession of a travel nurse has seen a significant boom, particularly in the "post-pandemic world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:08">[10:17:08]</a>. One travel nurse reported earning \$5,100 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Given assignments are typically 13 weeks, working approximately 45 weeks a year could lead to an annual income of about \$229,000 to \$230,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:55">[10:35:55]</a>. The demand for travel nursing is not expected to decrease soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:04">[11:16:04]</a>. While it's a high-stress, high-burnout, and nomadic lifestyle, there is "a ton of money to be made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:13">[11:28:13]</a>.

## Career Considerations

When considering career paths, especially for those interested in high-earning potential, the technology and healthcare sectors stand out. These fields often offer higher compensation compared to professions like social work, which may be more of a calling than a high-paying career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:05">[17:23:05]</a>.

For those interested in exploring these or other opportunities, platforms like Hirerect, a chat-based hiring app, can connect job seekers directly with founders, CEOs, and hiring managers in emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This app emphasizes transparency by requiring all job postings to include a salary range and features many remote opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.
[[trends_in_tech_job_market_and_layoffs | Trends in tech job market and layoffs]] are not explicitly mentioned as a factor for these specific roles but the general job market conditions influence [[current_job_market_analysis_and_opportunities | current job market analysis and opportunities]]. The discussion implicitly touches on [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | recent trends in the labor market and employment]] by sharing current salary data.

This article discusses [[Common trap interview questions and how to avoid them | common trap interview questions]] encountered in job interviews and provides strategies to answer them effectively. Interviewing can be challenging, but some questions are designed to be "traps" that can "tank" your chances if you're not careful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These "stinky questions" may seem simple on the surface, but they can significantly impact your prospects if you're unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The advice comes from Brian Kley, a corporate recruiter who has interviewed thousands of people and worked with numerous hiring managers, offering insights into what goes on "behind the scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Understanding Interview Traps
Interview "trap" questions are designed to assess more than just your factual knowledge or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. They often test your professionalism, self-awareness, motivation, and alignment with the company's values or the job's requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Avoiding these traps requires strategic preparation and a deep understanding of what the interviewer is truly looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Seven Common Trap Interview Questions and How to Dodge Them

Here are seven of the most common [[Common trap interview questions and how to avoid them | trap interview questions]] and recommended strategies for responding:

#### 1. "Why did you leave your last job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **The Trap**: This question tests your professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Negative answers, especially regarding being fired or having workplace drama, can make you look bad. A history of quitting without notice or job hopping might lead interviewers to judge your decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **How to Avoid**:
    *   Do not badmouth your previous employer or share excessive details; "less is more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Stay positive and focus on what you gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   **Example**: "I wanted a role to grow my skills in a specific area, maybe leadership, and my last job didn't offer that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   If you were laid off, mention it briefly without dwelling on it or complaining about unfairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   Pivot to why you are excited about the current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Keep it "classy" and focus on your fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

#### 2. "What's your biggest weakness?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   **The Trap**: This classic question assesses self-awareness and honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Interviewers want to see if you can identify and "own up to" a weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. They also want to ensure your stated weakness doesn't conflict with the job's core requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For example, stating you're not detail-oriented for a precision-required job would make you a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **How to Avoid**:
    *   Never say you have no weaknesses; it comes across as arrogant and insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   Avoid clich√©s like "I work too hard" or "I care too much" as employers see them as "copouts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Pick a real weakness that is *not* a deal-breaker for the specific job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   Research the company's core values before the interview to ensure your answer aligns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Companies like Amazon often test alignment with their leadership principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   After sharing a "relatively safe example," explain how you are actively working to fix or improve upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   **Example**: For a team lead position, you might say, "I used to struggle with delegating tasks, but I realized as I moved into more leadership roles that I needed to trust my team. I've learned to do that by understanding their capabilities and distributing workload more equally, which has boosted productivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Be honest and show growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

#### 3. "Where do you see yourself in five years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   **The Trap**: This question checks if your long-term goals align with the hiring manager's expectations for the role's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. If your goal (e.g., starting your own business soon) conflicts with their succession plan, they might perceive you as uncommitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Stating you want the interviewer's job can be seen as offensive, while having no plan at all makes you appear "lost or unmotivated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **How to Avoid**:
    *   Align your goals with the company's and the specific job's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   **Example**: "Ideally, I will have learned this job completely and be exceeding my expectations. In five years, I hope to be on a leadership career path while continuing to help the company's goals and building my leadership competency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   This shows ambition and a commitment to the "long haul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Be honest; don't "feed them a line of BS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. If the company expects leadership and you're not interested, it could lead to a "career mismatch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This question requires preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

#### 4. "Tell me about a time when you failed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   **The Trap**: This is a setup to see how you handle failure and setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Blaming others or picking a massive failure (e.g., costing the company a million dollars) can make you look unreliable or incompetent, leading to "negative probing questions" and putting you on the defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **How to Avoid**:
    *   Don't dodge the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
    *   Choose a relatively small failure that doesn't have "huge stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   "Own it," show improvement, and demonstrate growth from the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This approach is more likely to impress the hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

#### 5. "What's your current salary?" or "What are your salary expectations?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
*   **The Trap**: This can be a trap to lock you into a lower offer, or you might leave money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. High expectations might also scare them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Some states ban the "current salary" question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. If you avoid answering, you might be put in "rejected status or potentially limbo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **How to Avoid**:
    *   For "current salary," deflect and focus on the role's value, putting it back on the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   For "salary expectations," answer strategically. First, ask if they will share their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   If they ask you first, give your minimum acceptable salary (the amount that makes you feel good about the offer and stops you from looking further) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   Add 10-20% above that minimum to create your desired range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Conduct thorough salary research before the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    *   Be realistic about your true skills and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
    *   Control your salary worth; don't let the company solely determine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   It's a "waste of time" for both parties to proceed with a significant salary mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

#### 6. "What do you know about our job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
*   **The Trap**: Often mistaken for an icebreaker, this is a serious question testing if you've done your homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. They want to see genuine interest, not someone "just interviewing to interview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Not knowing about the role or company makes you look "lazy or just going through the motions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **How to Avoid**:
    *   Research the company's mission and understand the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   Show genuine interest, especially to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
    *   **Example**: "I know that the company focuses on [goal], they've just launched [new product], and this particular role supports [division] with these key responsibilities. I've read the job posting, but I'm happy for you to elaborate. I'm really excited about this position because of [reason]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   Asking timely questions can help establish a "dominant frame" in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. (For more on this, refer to "10 Questions to Ask Your Interviewer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>).

#### 7. "Why do you want to work here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   **The Trap**: Interviewers want to know your reasons beyond just needing a paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. While honesty might be "I need a freaking job, duh," it won't secure an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **How to Avoid**:
    *   "Swallow your pride" and make it about *them*, not you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   Remember the dynamic: they are the "buyer" shopping for talent, and you are the "seller" of your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   Tie your answer to what they are trying to solve for that job and show you're the best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   **Example**: "I admire your company's focus on [value], and I feel that based on the product or service you're offering, I would be a great fit because of X, Y, and Z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
    *   Show passion, alignment, and fit; employers will appreciate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

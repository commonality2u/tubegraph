Developing a strong online presence, particularly on platforms like LinkedIn, is crucial for career advancement and securing new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Recruiters extensively use LinkedIn to source and identify top candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, often preferring it over open job postings due to its targeted search capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

A corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience identifies six common mistakes job seekers make that can limit their career opportunities on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Key Mistakes to Avoid on LinkedIn

### 1. Not Allowing Contact

LinkedIn operates with two separate sites: the front-facing platform familiar to most users and "LinkedIn Recruiter," a back-channel used by recruiters to search the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Recruiters can search profiles using keywords and filters, often employing a "boolean search" to find specific skill set combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

A major frustration for recruiters is finding a perfect candidate but being unable to contact them because their settings block unknown users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This prevents recruiters from reaching out with potential job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Even passive candidates (not actively looking for a job) should consider allowing contact, as a few unwanted emails are a small price to pay for a potentially life-changing opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Receiving recruiter emails indicates that your profile is in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Keywords

Recruiters use "boolean searching" with strings of keywords to find targeted profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. If your LinkedIn profile lacks these specific keywords, you won't appear in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. It's essential to load your profile with keywords relevant to your industry and desired positions, reflecting major skills and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The more relevant keywords you include, the more likely recruiters are to find and contact you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### 3. Being Inactive

Having a great profile with keywords and open contact settings is useless if you don't check your LinkedIn messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Being active on the platform means keeping up with what's happening and checking your emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. You can set up notifications to an email address you frequently check, configuring settings to receive only direct messages rather than all network notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Being active also exposes you to opportunities posted by your network. Recruiters often repost high-quality positions, and many job opportunities appear directly in your feed without needing to search for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This active engagement helps you stay informed about industry trends and potential roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### 4. Not Networking

Many LinkedIn users have fewer than 100 connections, indicating inactivity and a weak network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. LinkedIn allows for a vast number of connections (up to 35,000-50,000), so there's no reason not to expand your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The more connections you have, the more visibility you gain, leading to greater opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

To build your network, connect with:
*   Previous employers and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   People in similar roles and companies within your local industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>
*   Individuals in your broader personal circles who might have professional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>

These [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | networks]] can lead directly to opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Aim to increase your connections to at least 500+, as this displays "500+" on your profile, suggesting you are active and invested in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### 5. Being a "Lurker" (Not Engaging)

Simply having connections isn't enough; you must engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. If you never engage on posts or create your own content, your name won't be seen, and you won't build your professional brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Engaging by leaving thoughtful comments and creating valuable content helps build your "employment brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Recruiters, who are on LinkedIn daily, will notice consistent engagement from targeted candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Even if uncomfortable at first, aim to engage on one post a day, and create one to three posts of your own content per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Consistency in engagement can lead to surprising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### 6. Engaging in Controversial Discussions

When building your employment brand through engagement, avoid participating in controversial discussions, especially those related to politics, religion, or other non-work-related belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Arguments on LinkedIn can be seen by hundreds of thousands of people across networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Such engagement can reflect negatively on your professional brand. While everyone is entitled to an opinion, LinkedIn is not the appropriate platform to "get up on a soapbox" about personal views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Maintaining [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professionalism]] is key; recruiters may judge whether someone who engages in online arguments would bring that behavior into an office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. These [[consequences_of_oversharing_in_a_professional_setting | consequences of oversharing]] and [[the_consequences_of_publicizing_workplace_issues | publicizing workplace issues]] can damage your career prospects. Keep discussions work-related and professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

By avoiding these common mistakes, job seekers can significantly enhance their LinkedIn presence and increase their chances of landing desired opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

When companies face the need for [[handling_layoffs_and_terminations_at_companies | layoffs]], cost-cutting measures are a primary driver behind these decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. This often involves a detailed examination of expenses, with a significant focus on payroll, which is one of the largest costs for any organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## Targeting Non-Core or Unprofitable Divisions

Companies frequently target divisions or projects that are either experimental or not generating significant revenue during cost-cutting initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. These "Skunk Works" or experimental projects are often the first to be eliminated when there is [[current_trends_and_causes_of_layoffs | economic uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This can lead to the spinning off of entire organizations or the elimination/de-emphasis of projects, resulting in [[handling_layoffs_and_terminations_at_companies | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Individuals working in these areas may be affected through no fault of their own, even if they are top performers or have recently been promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

## Scrutiny of High Earners and Skill Relevance

A common cost-cutting strategy involves companies reviewing departments to identify employees with high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This scrutiny compares an employee's compensation against their output or the relevance of their [[role_of_skills_and_departmental_need_in_layoffs | skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Senior professionals who may have allowed their [[role_of_skills_and_departmental_need_in_layoffs | skills]] to atrophy or haven't kept pace with market demands, yet command large salaries, can become targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. It becomes an easier decision for companies to replace them with cheaper talent, especially with the rise of disruptive technologies like AI that can potentially eliminate positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

## Voluntary Severance Programs as a Cost-Cutting Tool

Companies may offer voluntary severance programs as a cost-cutting measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. These programs aim to incentivize employees to accept early retirement or a lucrative package, reducing the need for involuntary [[handling_layoffs_and_terminations_at_companies | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. If enough employees accept these voluntary offers, it can reduce the number of people who would otherwise need to be forcibly removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

If something doesn't feel quite right at work, it might be time to consider a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article, based on insights from a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, outlines [[signs_you_should_quit_your_job_immediately | 10 signs that you should quit your job as soon as possible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, especially before the job market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Common [[reasons_to_quit_your_job | Reasons]] for Leaving a Job

The speaker, a former corporate recruiter, has talked to many candidates who left their jobs for a variety of [[reasons_to_quit_your_job | reasons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The following are some of the most common [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | signs]] indicating it might be time for a new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### 1. You Are Underpaid

One of the most common [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | signs]] is feeling underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. If market research shows that others in similar roles, either joining your organization or leaving it, are receiving significantly higher salaries, it's a strong indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. You can easily research current market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If your current salary is significantly below the market rate, it's a straightforward decision to update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

**Key points:**
*   You will likely never catch up to the market rate through incremental merit or cost-of-living increases, which are typically only 2-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Given recent inflation, if you didn't receive at least a 7-8% raise, you likely took a pay cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Some job types, like tech recruiting, have seen "explosive" salary growth of 30-40% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   If you've been in your role for five years or longer, you might be pleasantly surprised by current market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 2. You Are Constantly Overloaded or Overworked

Many people are feeling constantly overloaded or overworked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This is often a result of the "Great Resignation," where people have left the workforce, and companies have struggled to replace that talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Additionally, companies might cut expenses due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

When a team member quits, their work often falls to those remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. A job that once required two people might now be squeezed into one person's responsibilities, leading to 70, 80, or even 90-hour workweeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This is unsustainable and leads to burnout, which is a surefire way to be pushed to update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. When looking for a new role, remember to ask the right questions during interviews to avoid jumping into another problematic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### 3. The Company is in Financial Hot Water

Inflation and rising costs for raw materials, shipping, and doing business can put companies in financial distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Companies not well-equipped to handle this struggle to backfill positions or offer reasonable salary increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

A good company recognizes the need to invest in employees, offer competitive total compensation, and ensure work-life balance to avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. If your company is working you excessively hard and you haven't been able to take vacations, it's a strong reason to explore other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. An uptick in company layoffs, even in a strong market, is another indicator of financial instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Don't wait until you're caught in a layoff or are the last person turning off the lights; be proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### 4. You Experience a Strong Sense of Dread on Monday Mornings

If you feel a strong sense of dread when Monday morning arrives and look forward to the weekends, it's a clear indicator that something is not right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This feeling, sometimes called the "Sunday Scaries," suggests you're not fully engaged or passionate about your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

While work isn't always exciting, if you absolutely can't stand the idea of going to the office or logging in, it means you might be in the wrong job type, the wrong company, or experiencing burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Any of these should prompt you to consider your next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### 5. Your Company is Forcing a Return to the Office Without a Compelling Reason

For those who have been working remotely, if your company is forcing a return to the office purely for "facetime" or to utilize expensive office space, it's a good reason to explore other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Many companies are taking advantage of this trend, targeting candidates from organizations that mandate a return to the office by offering fully remote positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

If your job doesn't require you to be physically present and the company wants you there just for face time, it's a compelling reason to seek a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. While some argue that remote work can hinder promotional opportunities due to less networking, many remote-first companies successfully promote employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This might indicate you're in the wrong organization to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### 6. You Find Yourself Doing Less and Less (Quiet Quitting)

If you're doing less and less at work, often due to burnout, lack of motivation, or a loss of passion for the job, it's a [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | sign you need a new job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This concept is known as "quiet quitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. If you're struggling to find motivation or producing less, it's an indicator that a change is needed, as this situation is not sustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. You might need a breather, a different employer, or a completely different job type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### 7. You Feel Stagnated or Blocked

Many people quit because they feel stagnated in their job, not learning anything new, or unable to develop their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This could mean there's no upward mobility, and the people in the roles you aspire to seem unlikely to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. If you've taken the necessary steps but are still blocked from advancement, it's a clear [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | sign that you should be looking for another job]] that allows you to achieve your career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 8. Your Boss or Co-workers Are Toxic

Working in a toxic environment, especially with a toxic boss or co-workers, is unhealthy for your mental and physical wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This can negatively impact your upward mobility, work-life balance, sanity, and even health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. If something doesn't feel right, there are many other opportunities with better quality employers; it's not worth staying in a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### 9. Your Health is Suffering

A job should not negatively impact your health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Working in a toxic workplace can manifest as stress, anxiety, sudden weight gain or loss, changes in temperament, or shifts in sleep cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. If your job causes you to need medication, it's a definite [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | sign that you should be looking at other opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. There is no positive outcome to such a situation, and delaying a move for a promotion is not acting like a "free agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### 10. All Your Co-workers Are Quitting

If your co-workers are suddenly quitting, it's a strong [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | sign that maybe it's time for you to also update your resume and take a look around]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. There's likely a compelling reason why many people are leaving, especially if they appear happier and are earning more money in new organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Life is too short, and the market is strong enough not to be in a less than ideal situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Consider networking with former colleagues to see if there are opportunities on their new teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

If you find yourself in any of these situations and are considering a move, resources are available to help. The speaker offers tips and tricks from an insider's perspective on his website, including courses like "Resume Rocket Fuel" for resume writing and "Ultimate Job Seeker Bootcamp" for interview preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Limited private one-on-one coaching sessions are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

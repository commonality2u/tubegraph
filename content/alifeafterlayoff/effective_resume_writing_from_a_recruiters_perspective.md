As a recruiter and career coach, insights into effective resume writing are often gained from reviewing numerous resumes and observing common pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary goal of a resume is to help job seekers land more job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

While there isn't one singular "right" way to write a resume, the ultimate "litmus test" is whether it's achieving the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The approach shared here stems from a corporate [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter's perspective]], including how they quickly screen resumes (often a 5-second glance) and feedback from [[role_of_recruiters_versus_hiring_managers | hiring managers]] on their screening processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The objective is to [[recruiters_perspective_on_improving_job_application_success | improve your presentation]] to capture attention quickly and secure a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Key Tips for an Effective Resume

### Avoid Outdated & Overly Designed Templates
Many templates, particularly those from sites like Canva.com or large resume hubs, incorporate graphics, charts, and "cute" presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. These are generally ineffective because they distract from the main purpose of finding specific information quickly and concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Instead, opt for a simple, [[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | clean template]] from Microsoft Word, or a similar minimalist design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **One Column**: Choose a template with a single column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Colors & Fonts**: Avoid bright and flashy colors. Use clean, easy-to-read fonts with basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For most professions, a resume should be "relatively boring" in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Creative Fields Exception**: If you are a graphic designer or in a creative field, a more creative approach might be expected, but avoid using templates designed by other graphic designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

These elaborate templates often fail because they are designed by people who don't understand how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) work or how they parse resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Format Contact Information Vertically
[[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | ATS systems]] typically struggle to read and parse horizontal contact information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Formatting contact information vertically ensures that the system finds the information more cleanly and places it into the correct fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. If you find yourself frequently performing manual data entry when applying online, your resume may not be ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Profile for Specific Roles, Don't Just Summarize
Instead of summarizing every career accomplishment, which often leaves the employer hoping to find something they like, focus on "profiling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This means delivering exactly what the employer is looking for for a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Shift focus from irrelevant accomplishments to what hiring teams actually care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Customize Your Resume
[[optimizing_and_customizing_your_resume | Customization of your resume]] is crucial, especially in today's competitive job market, particularly for coveted remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While it may seem uncomfortable or require extra effort, it's essential to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Customizing your resume provides a competitive advantage, as many applicants are "lazy" and won't take this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Be Concise, Avoid Wordiness
[[improving_resume_clarity_and_conciseness | Wordy resumes]] with large blocks of text cause eyes to glaze over and are often skipped by recruiters and hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Think of online forums where large text blocks are ignored, but well-formatted, concise posts are easy to scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Be selective with your words and how they appear on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Eliminate Proprietary Language
Avoid using proprietary language like specific project names, division names, or product types that are only known within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The open market will not understand these terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Instead, boil down concepts into clear, common language for the industry you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This also ties into [[understanding_recruiter_language_and_implications | understanding recruiter language and implications]].

### Remove Generic, "Fluffy" Terminology
Generic phrases like "I'm a team player" or "I have great organizational skills" make recruiters and hiring managers roll their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Important competencies will be assessed during an interview anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Focus on actionable terms and concepts directly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job, not to impress with elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Adjust and Reassess
If your resume isn't yielding results, don't be stubbornâ€”redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Repeated rejections at the application level are a strong indicator that your resume isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This is particularly true if you believe you have a clear fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

It's also important to be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Take a close look at the job posting and honestly assess if you "truly stack up," especially when there are potentially thousands of other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Ensure your resume clearly conveys your fit to maximize your chances of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

The process should be "plan, do, check, and adjust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If your resume isn't getting the desired outcomes, make changes and try different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

A Wells Fargo employee, 60-year-old Denise Prudhomme, was found dead at her desk in a corporate office building in Tempe, Arizona, four days after she had clocked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The tragic incident highlights significant concerns about workplace culture, employee well-being, and oversight in large corporate environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Incident Details

Denise Prudhomme entered the Wells Fargo office building on August 16th at 7:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Four days later, on August 20th, building security contacted officials after a colleague found Prudhomme dead in her cubicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Her cubicle was located on the third floor, "tucked away" and "off the beaten path" from the main aisle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Multiple employees had complained of a foul odor, assuming it was due to plumbing issues, completely unaware of Prudhomme's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Lack of Oversight and Company Culture

The incident revealed a striking lack of awareness within the corporate environment. No one seemed to notice Prudhomme's absence for four full days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Questions arose about supervisory check-ins, meeting attendance, or communication regarding her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. An employee expressed heartbreak, stating, "what if I was just sitting there would nobody would check on me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Another added that the thought of her sitting there for so long would make them feel sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The situation is particularly ironic given that the finance industry, including companies like Wells Fargo, has been "very adamant about forcing people back into the office so that they could experience the corporate office culture this collaboration that's supposed to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Despite the push for in-person collaboration, "clearly nobody's collaborating with her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Even janitorial staff or others walking by apparently failed to notice her for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

The situation is described as "so disappointing and sad how broken the workplace is that this poor woman was completely forgotten in this manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This environment could be indicative of [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace|toxic workplace]] conditions, where individuals become invisible.

## Wells Fargo's Response

A Wells Fargo spokesman released a statement:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> "We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our colleague at the Tempe office. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones and this during this difficult time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>

The company stated that counselors were made available and that they were fully cooperating with the police department, directing further questions to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. There was no foul play suspected, and it was presumed she had a health event at her desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Lessons and Takeaways

This incident serves as a stark reminder for employees about their value and well-being in the workplace:

*   **Seek Appreciation**: If feeling underappreciated, employees should seek a workplace that values them and notices their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **[[prioritizing_employee_wellness_and_worklife_balance|Prioritize Health and Wellness]]**: It is crucial to prioritize personal health above all else. This includes taking sick days without guilt and utilizing vacation time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. The reality is "you never know when your last day is going to be and hopefully it's not sitting in a cubicle somewhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Advocacy**: Employees are often just "a cog in a wheel, a number on a spreadsheet," and may not be noticed if they expire at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. It is important to "reclaim control" and "act like the CEO of your career because clearly nobody else is looking out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

The speaker concludes that "everybody dropped the ball here and Denise deserved better than this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

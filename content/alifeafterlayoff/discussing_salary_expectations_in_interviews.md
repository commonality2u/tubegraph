When preparing for a job interview, it is crucial to be ready for the question, "What are your salary expectations?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> This question is typically asked during the preliminary interview with a recruiter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>

## Importance of Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>

This interview question is very important because many job seekers tend to [[the_pitfalls_of_salary_negotiation_in_job_applications | leave money on the table]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> The number you provide at this stage can influence your compensation throughout the process, making it difficult to adjust later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> Even with increasing salary transparency, companies often publish broad salary ranges that are not very helpful for job seekers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> It is beneficial to control the [[salary_negotiation_tactics | compensation discussion]] carefully, as you are the CEO of your own career. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>

## Preparation Before the Interview

Before the interview, ensure you have conducted thorough [[effective_salary_negotiation_strategies | salary research]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> You should determine your minimum acceptable salary to feel comfortable in the role. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>

## [[Approaching the question of salary expectations in interviews | Approaching the Question]]

When an interviewer asks about your salary requirements, you can initially redirect the question back to them by asking if they are willing to share their range first. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>

*   If they share a range that aligns with your expectations, you have a good starting point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>
*   If they insist you answer first, you need to be more strategic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>

### Recommended Response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>

A recommended approach is to state:
"Other opportunities that I'm considering are paying between [insert your desired minimum salary] and [add 20% above that]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

**Example:**
If your desired minimum is $100,000, you might say:
"Other companies that I'm considering are paying between $100,000 and $120,000. Does that seem to make sense with you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> Observe their reaction to this. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

### Key Considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>

*   Avoid stating your previous salary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>
*   Avoid stating simply what you would like to make. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
*   Provide a range to allow for [[negotiation_strategies_for_salary_expectations | wiggle room]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>

## Discussing Salary Later

If salary expectations haven't been covered by the time the recruiter commits to moving you to the next round, you can initiate the conversation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> You might say:
"Hey, you know, I'm really interested in this opportunity, but in order for me to commit to the next round, I just want to make sure that we're on the same page. Can we talk compensation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> Then, refer back to the strategic range approach. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>

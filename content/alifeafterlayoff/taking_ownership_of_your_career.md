From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

Taking ownership of your career means actively managing its direction and progression, much like a CEO manages a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It involves strategic planning and proactive decision-making rather than passively waiting for opportunities to arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## The Speaker's Personal Story

The speaker recounts a pivotal experience early in his career that shaped his philosophy on career ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### Initial Opportunity and Unfulfilled Promise
Recruited into a small railroad services company with approximately 600-700 employees, the speaker accepted a role as Staffing and Development Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The role involved recruiting and employee relations, essentially functioning as a Human Resources Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The premise for accepting the job was a promise of promotion to the Vice President of Human Resources role within 18 months, as the incumbent VP was supposedly retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The company environment was described as family-oriented, with supportive owners and a relatively laid-back atmosphere, offering a high degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The VP, while empathetic to employees, had an old-school approach and ran his department like a "little kingdom," holding significant influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Stagnation and Missed Opportunities
Despite the 18-month promise, the VP continued to work, showing no intention of retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Other senior leaders in the organization also delayed their retirements, reluctant to give up their positions and substantial bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The speaker was part of a leadership development group, but the senior leaders often convinced themselves that no one was capable of taking over their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The speaker's boss repeatedly told him he wasn't ready for the promotion, yet provided no real development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

One by one, the speaker's peers in the leadership development group, who were proactively managing their careers, began leaving the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. They recognized that waiting for internal recognition was futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Only a fraction of the succession group actually achieved their intended career progression within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:25]</a>.

### The Impact of Apathy and Comfort
The speaker, however, remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He had a steady, well-regarded job and a supportive boss in some aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. He became comfortable and apathetic, simply collecting a paycheck and not pushing for advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. What was promised as 18 months turned into nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Staying too long in the comfortable role meant he stopped learning and keeping up with industry trends, technology, or buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He essentially became "Joe," a reference to someone who stays in a steady job too long, hindering their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The continuous message of "you're not ready" also led him to question his own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Eventually, after seven years, the speaker gave up on his dream of becoming the head of HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He transitioned to a different role within the company, leveraging his talents in marketing and creative areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. When he finally left the organization, he discovered he was significantly behind his peer group in terms of skills, knowledge, abilities, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:29]</a>. He had to take a step down in responsibility to gain the necessary recruiting experience at larger companies, while his peers were advancing to senior director roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This comfort cost him a decade of career progression and thousands of dollars in lost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

*   **Don't Wait for Recognition**: If your efforts aren't being recognized or rewarded, especially if a company is keeping you stuck because you're "too good" at your current role, it's time to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **[[Acting like a free agent for career advancement | Act like a Free Agent]]**: Consistently test the open market and entertain other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

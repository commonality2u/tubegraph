Layoffs often occur in a calculated and impersonal manner, with companies sometimes using ambiguous performance metrics to justify terminations, even for new hires. The case of a Cloudflare account executive, who filmed her layoff, illustrates how these practices can be perceived as unfair and traumatizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Unpacking the Layoff Scenario

The account executive, a "relative new hire" who had only been with Cloudflare for a few months, was called into an unexpected meeting, a common precursor to [[performance_and_layoffs | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. Her colleagues had also received similar invites, leading her to anticipate the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The presence of an unfamiliar Human Resources (HR) representative on the call is often a clear indicator of impending termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.

The company stated that she had "not met Cloudflare expectations for performance" following 2023 performance evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### The New Hire "Ramp" and Limited Productivity
The individual had started on August 25th and completed a three-month "ramp" or onboarding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Following this, she had approximately two weeks of productivity in December, sandwiched between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Despite being a new employee with limited post-onboarding work time, the company attributed her layoff to substandard performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This stance was seen as "gaslighting" her, as her performance was likely not the true issue given her new status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

### Contradictory Feedback
The employee refuted the performance claim, highlighting that her manager consistently provided positive feedback, praising her activity, meetings, quick product learning, and client relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. She disagreed that she hadn't met performance expectations, stating her only perceived shortcoming was not officially closing deals in such a short, holiday-impacted period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Her manager was likely unaware of the layoff decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

Companies often make layoff decisions based on data points and spreadsheets, with senior leadership and HR making these decisions behind closed doors, often without the direct manager's involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Lack of Transparency Regarding Performance Metrics
When pressed for specifics regarding the performance metrics, the HR representatives were unable to provide concrete data, stating they couldn't share "specifics for numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. This evasiveness suggested they either lacked the data or were intentionally withholding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. The employee had also not been placed on a [[handling_denied_pto_and_performance_improvement_plans | Performance Improvement Plan]] (PIP), which would typically precede a performance-based termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>.

The company's claim of a performance issue was questionable, especially since they also stated the layoffs were a "collective assessment" and she wasn't being singled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. The use of performance as a reason for termination can be problematic, as it could negatively impact a person's future employment prospects if recorded as "fired for performance," potentially flagging them as ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

The speaker noted that it would have been "cleaner" and more honest for the company to simply state that the position was no longer part of their strategic plan, rather than fabricating a performance reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications
This situation highlights the disconnect between [[employer_expectations_vs_reality | employer expectations]] and the reality of employee experience, particularly during layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Companies often prioritize calculated decisions over human connection, leading to jarring experiences for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. The CEO of Cloudflare acknowledged the video was "painful to watch" but did not change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

It also raises questions about accountability, as the individuals responsible for over-hiring are rarely the ones affected by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. This incident underscores the importance for employees to view their careers pragmatically, acting as "free agents" and the CEOs of their own careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. It emphasizes the need for proactive preparation, including contingency plans and alternative income streams, to protect oneself from sudden job disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>.

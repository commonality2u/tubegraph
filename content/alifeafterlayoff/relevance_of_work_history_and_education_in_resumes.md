When crafting a resume, it is crucial to understand which aspects of your work history and education are most relevant to include to make a strong impression on recruiters and hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The goal is to create a clean, concise, and well-crafted document that helps you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Work History Considerations

To optimize your resume, consider the following points regarding work history:

*   **Relevance and Age of Experience**
    *   Avoid including work history that is not relevant to the position or is over 10 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
    *   Employers typically prioritize the last 10 years of work, and even more specifically, the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   Skills gained over 10 years ago may no longer be relevant due to changes in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Unless applying for a senior executive position explicitly requiring 20 or more years of experience, a long, elaborate work history is generally unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

*   **Avoiding Jargon and Acronyms**
    *   Do not use industry-specific jargon, internal job titles, or acronyms that are not widely understood outside of your previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   If a recruiter or hiring manager cannot understand the acronym or jargon, it hinders your resume's [[tips_for_improving_resume_content | discoverability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   Make your job duties and skills as clear as possible to improve your chances of being hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Education Details

When detailing your education, brevity and strategic inclusion are key:

*   **Degree Information**
    *   Do not provide excessive detail about your degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   Simply state the university name and the degree type (e.g., "Penn State" and the degree, rather than specifying the business school within the university) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **Minor Degrees**
    *   Employers do not typically weight minor degrees heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   While a minor can serve as a useful keyword, avoid wasting valuable resume space detailing all the courses studied for a minor, unless you are entry-level and need extra keywords to demonstrate fit for your first job out of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

*   **Grade Point Average (GPA)**
    *   If you are more than three years out of college, it is advisable to remove your GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, as employers generally do not care about it at that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   For entry-level candidates or those with less than three years of total work experience, including your GPA is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, but plan to remove it once you gain more experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Internships**
    *   If you have been in the workforce for longer than three years, you can remove internships from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   Internships are typically not counted as total years of experience and may be considered vanity statistics for experienced candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

In recent times, it has become increasingly important for individuals to prioritize their own career interests, adopting a "selfish" approach, or acting as a "free agent" or "CEO of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This perspective is particularly relevant given the current state of [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | human resource practices in layoffs]] and how companies are treating employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Current State of the Labor Market and Layoffs

The labor market has seen a "definitive softening" over the past six to eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Many companies, especially in the tech industry, are conducting layoffs, a trend expected to continue spilling over into other industries throughout 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This follows a period of "crazy economic boom" where hiring was rampant, and significant wage increases were common, particularly in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The unsustainable nature of this boom led to a rapid market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Poor [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | Handling of Layoffs by Companies]]

Companies appear not to have learned from past mistakes in treating employees with dignity and respect during the employment process, particularly during [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Numerous recent examples highlight highly unprofessional and distasteful layoff methods:
*   **Badge Deactivation**: A Google employee, after more than 10 years with the company and forced to return to the office with a long commute, discovered their layoff when their badge no longer worked upon arriving at the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. There was no prior email or call from management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **During Business Trips**: Employees have been notified of layoffs while in the middle of business trips, away from home, facing immediate embarrassment and disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **During Labor**: One individual was laid off while actively in labor and about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Short Tenures**: An employee left a previous company to join Google, only to be laid off 13 weeks later, derailing their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This highlights a lack of accountability for the [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | disruption to people's lives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

This behavior leads to significant employee dissatisfaction and a sense of being "jerked around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Public Perception and Reckless Hiring
Despite the severe [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | impact of layoffs on employees]], some individuals express a lack of sympathy for those laid off from major tech companies like Google, Facebook, or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, it's argued that these individuals are in a similar precarious position and sought the highest possible earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Companies are also criticized for "hiring recklessly," where senior leaders may view employees merely as numbers on a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. These "numbers" are people with lives, families, mortgages, and career aspirations that are often wiped away by sudden layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

An example of this is Zillow, which laid off a large portion of its recruiting staff in late 2022, only to post the same jobs a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This raises questions about accountability for destroying lives and then rehiring for the same roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Acting Like a Free Agent

Given these practices, the concept of acting like a free agent in one's career is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This means always looking out for your own best interest first, as "nobody else is going to look out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### The Death of Corporate Loyalty
Corporate loyalty, where individuals worked for decades at the same company for a pension, is largely dead, a relic of the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Today's workforce is characterized by an "instant gratification" culture and a "what have you done for me lately" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The cycle often involves layoffs when times get tough, followed by rapid rehiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Anecdotal Success of a Free Agent
An individual laid off in November unexpectedly secured multiple job offers by December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. By updating their resume and LinkedIn profile, and networking effectively to bypass recruiters, they landed a position offering a $50,000 raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Even after accepting an offer and starting a new job in January, they were advised to complete interviews for another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This led to an even stronger offer, $30,000-$40,000 better than the accepted one, totaling nearly $100,000 more than their original job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The advice given was to "take the better opportunity" by continuing to act as a free agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Employees as "Human Resources"

Ultimately, companies view employees as "human resources"â€”a term often disliked but accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Employees are numbers on a spreadsheet, useful as long as they serve a purpose, and their positions can be eliminated without hesitation when no longer deemed useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Therefore, individuals should think for themselves and prioritize their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

By assessing a company's past behavior during [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | layoffs]] and their current practices, individuals can "cast a vote" by choosing which companies to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This helps hold companies accountable for poor behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

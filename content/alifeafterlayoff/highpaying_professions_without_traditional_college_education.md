This is a gig-based role requiring constant job seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Unpaid and Underpaid Positions

Conversely, some crucial professions appear to be [[unpaid_and_underpaid_job_positions | underpaid job positions]] relative to their responsibilities or educational requirements:
*   **Research with Brain Cells/HIV/Cocaine/Fentanyl**
    *   A master's degree holder makes $29,500 per year ($14 an hour), considered a "poverty level" wage for the education required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This raises questions about the [[value_and_challenges_of_a_college_education_in_job_hunting | value and challenges of a college education in job hunting]], specifically for advanced degrees in certain fields.
*   **Air Ambulance Pilot**
    *   Reported income of $80,000 a year, which is considered shockingly low for a helicopter pilot in a life-saving role, especially given that the medical industry often pays low unless one is a doctor or physician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Air Traffic Controller**
    *   Claims around $100,000 a year for one of the most stressful jobs, responsible for thousands of lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This income is considered potentially underpaid for the immense responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **EMT**
    *   Earns $15 an hour on the high end, with some experienced EMTs making as little as $10.50 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This is highlighted as a disparity given their life-saving role as first responders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Professional Theater Actress**
    *   Makes $568 per week before taxes, roughly $29,500 per year, underscoring that following a passion in arts may not yield high financial returns, often requiring side jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Aircraft Cleaner**
    *   Makes $17 an hour, but enjoys perks like free flights, which is a significant benefit in the airline industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. These perks can act as "golden handcuffs" for lower-paying positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

## High-Paying Professions Typically Requiring Advanced Education

For contrast, some highly compensated roles generally require advanced degrees or extensive experience:

    *   Makes about $126,000 a year, likely with five to seven years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. An electrical engineer could potentially earn even higher, up to $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Travel Nurse**
    *   As an agency worker, earns $81.50 an hour, and $130 an hour for overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This role has seen a surge in pay since the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Specialist**
    *   With a PhD from a well-known school and less than one year of experience, this IT professional reports $230,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Software Engineer**
    *   A software engineer reports a total compensation of $384,000, likely with five to eight years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This is common at large tech companies ("FANG" companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **School Psychologist**
    *   A highly tenured professional makes $120,000-$125,000 for 180 days of work (approximately half a year), with full benefits and retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This salary was achieved over 35 years through a graduated pay scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

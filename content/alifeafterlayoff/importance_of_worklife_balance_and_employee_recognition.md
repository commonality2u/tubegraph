## Tragic Incident at Wells Fargo

A Wells Fargo employee, 60-year-old Denise Prudhomme, was tragically found dead at her desk in a Tempe, Arizona corporate office building four days after she had clocked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Prudhomme entered the office building on Friday, August 16th, at 7:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Her body was discovered by building security on August 20th, four days later, after an anonymous employee found her in her cubicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead at 4:55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, suggesting she had likely been deceased for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Her cubicle was located on the third floor, away from the main aisle, in a "tucked away" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Despite multiple people complaining of a foul odor, it was assumed to be due to plumbing issues, and no one realized a person was "decomposing for four full days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Lack of Employee Recognition and Corporate Culture

The incident highlights a concerning lack of [[employee_value_and_workplace_respect | employee value and workplace respect]] and attention within the corporate environment. An employee expressed heartbreak, questioning if anyone would check on them if they were in a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The fact that Denise Prudhomme spent her final moments in an office, dying at her desk without anyone noticing for days, underscores a profound invisibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Questions arose about managerial oversight and basic human connection:
*   "Where is the boss? Is anybody ever checking in on just to even see what work she's producing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   "Did she have the show up to any meetings? Literally nobody realized that this woman wasn't even there for four full days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   The absence of simple check-ins like "hm, we haven't seen Denise in a few days," or invitations for coffee or lunch, suggests a highly disengaged [[work_life_balance_and_company_culture | company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

A Wells Fargo spokesman released a statement expressing deep sadness and offering counselors, stating cooperation with police and directing further questions to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, this response did not address the fundamental questions about the [[employee_wellbeing_and_company_accountability | employee wellbeing and company accountability]] and workplace culture that allowed such an event to go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The situation is particularly ironic given that the finance industry, including companies like Wells Fargo, has been "very adamant about forcing people back into the office so that they could experience the corporate office culture [and] this collaboration that's supposed to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. In this case, "clearly nobody's collaborating with her; she's literally rotting away on the third floor by herself in a cube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The fact that janitors or other building staff also failed to notice anything for days further emphasizes the isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The incident lasted from Friday to Monday, with discovery likely at the "close of business Monday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The sad reality is that "the work that she was producing couldn't have been all that valuable to them if they didn't even realize that she wasn't there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

This tragic event offers critical takeaways for both employees and companies:

*   **Seek [[the_importance_of_nonmonetary_job_benefits | Value and Recognition]]:** If you feel unappreciated, find a workplace that values you and notices your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Health and [[importance_of_worklife_balance | Work-Life Balance]]:** Place your health and wellness above all else. Take sick days and vacations without guilt, as "you never know when your last day is going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Corporate Reality:** Understand that in many corporate settings, employees can be seen as "just a cog in a wheel, a number on a spreadsheet," and their absence or even death might not be noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Be the CEO of Your Career:** Take control of your career and well-being, as "clearly nobody else is looking out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The disappointment stems from how "broken the workplace is that this poor woman was completely forgotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, and the likelihood that her position would be quickly filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. "Denise deserved better than this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

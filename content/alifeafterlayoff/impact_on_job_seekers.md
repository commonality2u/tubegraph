The current job market presents conflicting data, with the FED reporting a robust market and record job openings, while major corporations simultaneously announce layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This contradictory information creates confusion for [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | job seekers]] who are experiencing an increase in "ghost postings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## The Rise of Ghost Job Postings

Ghost postings are job listings that employers have no real intention of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A common type is the "pipelining wreck," where employers post positions simply to collect resumes for a future date, without immediate hiring plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This practice is criticized for creating a "very poor candidate experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## How Ghost Postings Affect Job Seekers

The presence of ghost postings, combined with an influx of laid-off individuals in the job market, creates a frustrating environment for [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | job seekers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. When a job seeker invests time in creating a targeted, custom resume and application, only to have it ignored because the employer has no intention of filling the role, it leads to disappointment and wasted effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Employers, particularly leaders in talent acquisition, often "lose sight of the candidate experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> and fail to consider the job seeker's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This can be particularly disheartening in areas with limited job opportunities, where a compelling posting from a major employer can create false hope and lead to anxious, unrewarded waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The speaker states, "It's just not a good look and I just wish employers would think candidate experience first so if you're an employer watching this get rid of your stupid pipelining wrecks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Misleading Job Market Data

The overall number of job openings reported by official sources can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Many of these "record number of jobs" are often contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that may not offer benefits or be considered long-term career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This creates a disconnect for [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | job seekers]] who hear the market is robust but struggle to find suitable employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The speaker believes these numbers are "fudged" for various reasons, making it frustrating for the average job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs (and their Impact)

A survey conducted by Clarify Capital in 2022, involving 1,045 managers, revealed key reasons for ghost postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>:

*   **Always Open to New People (50%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>: Companies keep requisitions open to "window shop" for potential candidates without immediate hiring intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This is seen as disappointing for active [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | job seekers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **To Keep Current Employees Motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>: This practice is viewed as deceptive, as it might involve tricking existing employees into believing help is coming when it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **To Give the Impression that the Company is Growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>: This is considered "deceitful to both the job candidate and the investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Working for such a company is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Job Was Filled** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>: The job requisition was not pulled down after being filled, which is attributed to [[impact_of_lazy_recruiters_on_candidate_experience | lazy recruiters]] or HR personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **To Have an Active Pool of Candidates in Case of Turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>: This is a direct parallel to how [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_gain_a_competitive_edge | job seekers]] should always keep their resumes updated and be open to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **In Case an Irresistible Candidate Applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>: This indicates "lazy recruiting" and is deemed irresponsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **To Placate Overworked Employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>: This is seen as "particularly sinister," as it tricks overloaded employees into believing relief is coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. If the "cavalry never shows up," an employee might be a victim of ghost requisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Forgot to Delete the Job** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>: Another instance of [[impact_of_lazy_recruiters_on_candidate_experience | lazy recruiter]] or HR behavior with no excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **No Reason in Particular / Don't Care** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>: Indicates a lack of concern from the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Ghost Postings

To avoid falling victim to ghost requisitions, [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_navigate_tough_job_markets | job seekers]] should:

*   **Check Posting Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>: If a job has been active for over six months, or is repeatedly reposted, it's likely a ghost listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This suggests a low-quality employer or position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Conduct Reverse Reference Checks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>: Investigate if the company recently had major layoffs, especially in roles similar to the one posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. If so, the company may be trying to rebuild a candidate pipeline for potentially vulnerable roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Analyze Job Description Detail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>: A detailed job description with specifics about accomplishments and support indicates a serious, actively recruited position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Generic, salesy descriptions are a red flag for pipelining wrecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Consider Recency of Post** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>: Jobs posted within the last week are more likely to be legitimate and actively recruited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

[[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_gain_a_competitive_edge | Job seekers]] are encouraged to focus only on high-quality roles with reputable employers and treat themselves as "true free agents" and "CEOs of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Being repeatedly passed over for promotions can be a significant indicator that a company is attempting to "quiet fire" an employee, making their situation unbearable enough to encourage them to quit voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a>.

## Signs and Consequences

When a company consistently overlooks an employee for a promotion, especially if that employee has clearly expressed interest and positioned themselves as the best fit, it's a critical warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>. Even if someone else who may be less deserving is promoted instead, it's important to pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

Behind the scenes, when a company decides to promote someone else over an employee, discussions almost always occur regarding the potential fallout and the need for "damage control," especially if the passed-over individual felt they were in line for the promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Career Implications

Being continually passed up for promotion suggests that the opportunity is likely not one worth staying with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. A "steady job" without career progression is considered detrimental to one's overall career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

> "If you're somebody that's being passed up for promotion it's probably not an opportunity you want to stick with anyway because as we know a steady job is bad for our careers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>

## Proactive Steps

If an employee finds themselves consistently blocked from promotion, the recommended course of action is to [[consequences_of_overstaying_in_a_job_role | update their resume]], start networking, and actively seek opportunities in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This approach encourages acting like a "free agent" to make the best decisions for one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

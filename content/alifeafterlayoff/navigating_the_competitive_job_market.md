Quitting your job right now might not be the best decision for many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While individuals often seek career coaching due to issues with leadership, lack of respect, toxic environments, underpayment, or unfulfilling work, directly quitting is frequently not in their best interest, especially given [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | today's job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Current Job Market Realities

The current job market is not favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Many who have quit jobs discover that replacing them is very difficult and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Even marketable individuals with good backgrounds are finding it hard to get interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Increased Competition
The [[global_job_market_competition | job market is extremely competitive]] right now, with companies often receiving thousands of candidates for a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This is particularly true for highly sought-after remote and even hybrid roles, as it's becoming rare for companies to be remote-first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Job seekers are now competing with double or triple the number of applicants compared to just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### Shift from the "Heyday"
The job market is significantly different than it was in 2021 and most of 2022, which was considered a "heyday" for job seekers when companies were aggressively recruiting talent with high offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. During this period, many people pursued the tech boom, rebranding themselves for software development and technical roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. However, the tech market subsequently declined, and lucrative job offers dried up overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This has resulted in a surplus of individuals struggling to find new employment after changing their career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### Remote Mandates and Economic Cooldown
Many who participated in the [[navigating_career_transitions_and_job_market_changes | Great Resignation]] took remote jobs under the assumption of a permanent remote work-life, but companies are increasingly mandating a return to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Those who then quit to find new remote roles are discovering their phones are not ringing as often as they did a couple of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Signs of an economic cooldown are evident, with fewer lucrative job offers and companies resetting salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This trend does not favor individuals looking to jump ship for a salary increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Consequently, many who participated in the [[navigating_career_transitions_and_job_market_changes | Great Resignation]] now feel stuck or regret their decisions, leading to a new phenomenon known as the "Great Regret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## When Quitting Might Be Necessary
While generally not recommended as a first option, quitting might be appropriate in truly toxic situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This includes scenarios where you are asked to do something illegal or unethical, or if you face bonafide harassment or a hostile work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. In such cases, seeking a different employer is advisable, but it's crucial to proceed with "eyes wide open" about the current labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Job Seekers in the Current Market
If you are currently employed, it's recommended to buckle down and focus on improving your resume to make it shine in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This will help you compete with thousands of other candidates and ensure you get noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

Instead of quitting merely for a small pay increase or a disliked boss, wait for the right opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Over the next few months, prioritizing stability and finding a job or industry with growth and strength will be paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

To successfully navigate the job market, you need to act like the CEO of your career by making smart, strategic decisions rather than knee-jerk reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Quitting without a clear strategy is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

[[ai_in_the_tech_industry | AI technology]] is enabling individuals to create professional-looking [[creating_linkedin_headshots_using_ai | LinkedIn headshots]] without needing a traditional photographer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This development is described as "super fascinating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and potentially a "game changer" for those seeking an improved profile picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The Remini App: An Overview
A viral application called Remini allows users to upload multiple selfies and then generates "pretty convincing professional headshots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The speaker aimed to experiment with the app to assess its realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### How it Works
1.  **Upload Selfies:** Users select 8 to 12 photos of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  **Select Gender:** The app prompts the user to pick their gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
3.  **Choose Reference Style:** A reference image or aesthetic (e.g., modern, Korean aesthetic) is selected to guide the generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  **Generate:** The app then renders a custom profile, spitting out a variety of headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Examples of AI-Generated Headshots
The speaker showcased several examples of Remini's output:
*   **Original vs. AI:** One example depicted an original photo transformed into an [[ai_in_the_tech_industry | AI]]-generated headshot that was considered "pretty insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Variety of Styles:** Other examples included a range of headshots generated from a single user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Influencer Results:** An influencer's headshot was transformed into professional-looking images in "a bunch of different locations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Realism:** Most generated images looked "really convincing" and "professional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, though one example showed shoulders that looked "a little bit fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Overall, the results were described as "quite remarkable" and "freaking me out" due to their seamlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Personal Experiment Results
The speaker tested the Remini app on himself and his wife:
*   **Speaker's Photos:** The initial generated photos included one that "makes me look younger" and another that the speaker considered using for his [[creating_linkedin_headshots_using_ai | LinkedIn]] profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Wife's Photo:** The app also generated a convincing [[creating_linkedin_headshots_using_ai | LinkedIn profile headshot]] for the speaker's wife, which she approved of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Impact on Professional Photography
The advent of this [[ai_in_the_tech_industry | AI technology]] presents an "interesting dilemma" for [[impact_of_ai_on_professional_headshot_photographers | headshot photographers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The speaker, who previously found headshot photography "very lucrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, wonders how this [[ai_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] advancement will [[impact_of_ai_on_jobs | impact their profession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Recommendations for Using AI Headshots
A significant concern with using such an app is "catfishing," where the generated photo doesn't accurately represent the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The recommendation is to use source photos that "accurately represent how you currently look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The tool should be used to achieve a "clean and professional looking headshot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, not to completely misrepresent oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Ultimately, [[ai_in_the_tech_industry | AI technology]] can provide "pretty good and pretty convincing headshots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, offering a cost-effective alternative to professional services for upgrading a [[creating_linkedin_headshots_using_ai | LinkedIn profile]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. A good [[creating_linkedin_headshots_using_ai | LinkedIn profile picture]] is a necessity for attracting the right career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

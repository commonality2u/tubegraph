Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, especially when employers ask suspicious questions that might indicate an ulterior motive or low quality [00:00:23]. Employers often provide "tells" that can help job seekers identify low-quality opportunities during an interview [00:00:36]. Listening carefully for certain [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]] can help you discern if an opportunity is worth pursuing, or if you should consider walking away [00:00:46].

## Common Interview Questions That Are Red Flags

Certain questions posed by interviewers can serve as significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]], revealing underlying issues with the company culture or management.

### Unplanned Absences History
An interviewer might ask, "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?" [00:01:52]. While this question might seem innocent, especially for hourly positions trying to determine attendance issues, it can indicate a company or department that is overly focused on attendance policies [00:01:58]. This focus often stems from past attendance problems, suggesting a potentially inflexible workplace [00:02:15]. A candidate might want to ask the interviewer about their expectations regarding unplanned absences; an employer "cracking down" on attendance could signal a toxic workplace [00:02:57].

### Minimum Acceptable Salary
When an interviewer asks, "What's your minimum acceptable salary?" [00:03:10], it suggests the employer is trying to determine the lowest possible amount to offer [00:03:12]. This can be a sign that the company is not flexible with compensation and may attempt to lowball candidates [00:03:18]. Such an approach at the outset could indicate future struggles with maintaining a competitive salary, raises, or promotions [00:03:22].

### Commitment to Role Duration
A question like, "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?" [00:03:38] can be a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] for high turnover [00:03:42]. It suggests the employer has difficulty retaining staff in that specific role, prompting the question: "Why are people leaving so quickly?" [00:03:50]. This line of questioning often indicates a bias or a larger cultural problem within the company [00:04:03].

### History of Being Fired
Asking "Have you ever been fired?" [00:04:10] is generally not relevant to a candidate's ability to perform the job at hand [00:04:17]. Past employment decisions, particularly adverse ones, do not always predict future performance [00:04:23]. Such a question can be a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] that the employer is overly focused on past negative situations rather than a candidate's potential [00:04:27]. If pressed on this question, a candidate might redirect to focus on their accomplishments and future abilities [00:04:37]. Continued probing can indicate an employer not worth working for [00:04:49].

### Accusations of Resume Exaggeration
If an interviewer accuses a candidate of exaggerating or embellishing their resume (assuming the resume is truthful), it's a significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] [00:04:57]. This indicates a lack of trust from the beginning, implying the employer either thinks the candidate is lying or assumes everyone lies [00:05:07]. This type of accusation can signal a toxic and distrustful culture [00:05:20].

### "What's your biggest failure?"
Similar to "greatest weakness" questions, asking "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?" [00:05:28] can be a trap question [00:05:31]. While it might aim to understand how a candidate overcomes adversity, it's often poorly phrased and can lead to the employer using the answer as a bias against the candidate [00:05:39]. A better approach for the candidate is to focus on how they overcame adversity rather than dwelling on the failure itself [00:05:54].

### Availability for Off-Shifts/Weekends (for standard roles)
For roles with set shifts, questions about availability for off-shifts or weekends [00:06:12] can be a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] [00:06:16]. This often indicates an expectation of significant overtime, potentially against the employee's will, and a poor work-life balance [00:06:18]. Candidates should push back to clarify true work hour expectations [00:06:26].

### On-Site Availability for Remote Roles
If interviewing for a remote job, being asked about availability to come on-site [00:06:34] is a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] [00:06:37]. This implies the position is likely a hybrid role, not truly remote [00:06:41]. If a job is pitched as fully remote but is actually hybrid, there's a high likelihood it could eventually transition to 100% in-office [00:06:46].

### Dealing with Rude Co-workers or Managers
A question like, "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?" [00:07:04] immediately raises concerns about the workplace environment [00:07:07]. It implies that rudeness is a common issue within the company [00:07:10]. If the rudeness specifically involves managers, it's a significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] indicating a cultural problem that should be avoided [00:07:13].

## Interviewer Behavior as a Red Flag

Beyond specific questions, the interviewer's conduct during the interview itself can be a major [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]].

### No Opportunity for Candidate Questions
If an interviewer dominates the conversation and does not provide the candidate an opportunity to ask their own questions at the end of the interview process, it's a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] [00:07:30]. This shows a lack of understanding that an interview is a two-way street, where the candidate should also be assessing the company and the role [00:07:43]. An employer who takes offense to a candidate asking professional questions may believe they are "above" being assessed, which indicates a problematic company culture [00:08:08].

## Conclusion

While one or two of these questions or behaviors alone may not definitively mean a company is of poor quality, they serve as crucial data points [00:08:27]. It is essential for job seekers to use these [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]] as indicators to ask further probing questions and ensure they understand what they are committing to before accepting a job offer [00:08:35].

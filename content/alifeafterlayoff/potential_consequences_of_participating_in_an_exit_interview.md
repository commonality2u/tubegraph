When an employee tenders their resignation, Human Resources may ask them to participate in an [[exit_interviews_in_the_workplace | exit interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While these interviews are primarily conducted to gather data for the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, there are potential downsides for the departing employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Purpose of an Exit Interview
Companies typically conduct exit interviews to collect data on overall trends within their workforce, particularly concerning voluntary turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This data can help identify issues such as uncompetitive compensation or problematic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. They might also investigate if a specific manager has an abnormally high turnover rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The goal is to track employment trends and implement corrective actions if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While the intent is generally not sinister, it's about data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The interview is usually conducted by an HR representative who follows a standard form, asking questions like:
*   Why did you decide to leave? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Where are you going? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   What kind of position are you taking? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   What feedback can you provide? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   How did you like your boss? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Would you consider returning in the future? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

This information is then stored, potentially in the employee's file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Potential Consequences for the Employee
While there's nothing for the employee to gain from an exit interview, there is potential for loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Burning Bridges
One of the primary risks is burning a bridge with the former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. If an employee uses the interview to vent frustrations about their boss, lack of opportunities, low pay, or a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, this information is documented and associated with their employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

This documented negativity can be referenced if the employee ever seeks to return to that employer in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. What might have been a good standing can turn into a "not hirable" status due to the negative feedback provided during the exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Limited Impact of Feedback
Even if an employee lays out all their grievances, the human resources representative conducting the interview likely has little power to make major decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. There's no guarantee the feedback will reach the decision-makers who could enact change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, meaning the effort might fall on deaf ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Reference Checks
It's a misconception that a future employer checking references will be able to access details from an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Generally, previous employers will not share specific details about why an employee left, as doing so could open them up to legal liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## When to Decline an Exit Interview
[[reasons_to_decline_an_exit_interview | Exit interviews are not required]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Companies cannot withhold pay or take any adverse action against an employee for declining to participate; it is strictly voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Given the potential to burn bridges and the limited benefit to the employee, it's generally advisable to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### The Exception
If an employee is absolutely certain they will never return to that employer, an exit interview can be an opportunity to express their true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. However, it's important to weigh this against the potential for professional repercussions, even if minor.

Ideally, an employer should already be aware of an employee's reasons for leaving through regular communication and feedback channels, rather than needing to discover them during an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Securing job interviews is a significant achievement, indicating you are "ahead of the curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, if these interviews aren't translating into job offers, it suggests that some common mistakes might be hindering your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The job market is highly competitive, with employers often having an "abundance of qualified candidates" and being "very selective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Therefore, having your "A game" during the [[role_of_interview_skills_in_getting_hired | interview process]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By understanding and addressing these common errors, you can improve your [[role_of_interview_skills_in_getting_hired | interview skills]] and increase your chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

A recruiter and human resources professional with over 20 years of experience, having hired thousands of people for diverse roles, outlines key areas where candidates often falter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These "tried and true and battle tested" tips come directly from the employer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### 1. Talking Too Much

A frequent [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_during_interviews | interview mistake]] is over-explaining or rambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This often stems from nervousness or a lack of understanding of the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It can also indicate a lack of emotional intelligence, where a candidate struggles to gauge the interviewer's reactions or cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Instead of taking time to formulate a concise answer, candidates might start speaking prematurely, then second-guess themselves and branch off into unrelated topics, often failing to answer the original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

All interview questions serve a specific purpose, designed to learn aspects of your background relevant to the job profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Guessing what the interviewer is looking for is inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Instead, if you are unsure:
*   **Ask for Clarification:** It is advisable to pause and ask the interviewer for clarification, for example, "I think that you're asking me about this, but can you clarify? I just want to make sure that I'm giving you the right information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This demonstrates self-awareness and business acumen, which recruiters appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Be Concise:** It's generally better to provide a thorough yet concise answer than to give too much detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. A skilled interviewer will ask additional probing questions if more information is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### 2. Not Being Prepared

[[interview_preparation_tips | Preparation]] is paramount for a successful interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Showing up unprepared makes a poor [[first_impressions_during_job_interviews | first impression]], indicating a lack of seriousness about the job, your career, or the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This reflects negatively on both you and the recruiter who sent you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **Research the Company and Role:** Before any interview, thoroughly research the company website, especially the careers section, and carefully review the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Knowing the interviewer's name is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. While a deep dive into obscure data isn't necessary, a basic understanding shows engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Prepare for Questions:** Anticipate common interview questions, especially those related to core competencies and behavior-based scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Think of past experiences that align with various competencies to ensure smoother responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### 3. Being Over-Prepared (Robotic)

While [[interview_preparation_tips | preparation]] is good, excessive rehearsal can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. If you are too rehearsed and speak from a script, any deviation can cause you to "trip up," appear nervous, and come across as inauthentic or robotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

*   **Be Authentic:** Authenticity is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Frame your answers as "story arcs" of your career, pulling from genuine experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. If you've truly done what you're discussing, you should be able to speak about it with passion and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### 4. Not Being Enthusiastic Enough

A lack of enthusiasm can make it seem like you don't truly want the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Hiring managers prefer candidates who are energetic and excited about the opportunity, as enthusiasm is "infectious" and contributes to a positive team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   **Practice Energy:** If enthusiasm doesn't come naturally, especially for introverts, practice maintaining a positive energy level, even in front of a mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This contributes to a strong [[professional_demeanor_during_an_interview | professional demeanor]].

### 5. Not Asking Any Questions

Failing to ask questions at the end of an interview can make you appear disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The interview process is a two-way street; you should also be evaluating the company to ensure it's the right fit for your career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

*   **Prepare Thoughtful Questions:** Come prepared with good questions for the hiring team and manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Inquire about the role's contribution to the department's success, specific objectives, and the company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Asking insightful questions impresses interviewers and shows you are a potentially engaged employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This is a critical component of [[preparing_questions_for_interviewers | preparing questions for interviewers]].

By reflecting on these areas and implementing small "tweaks" with strategy and planning, you can significantly improve your [[communication_and_availability_during_the_job_interview_process | communication and availability]] during the interview process and ultimately land your dream job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Navigating the question "What's your [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_interviews | salary expectation]]?" is a crucial part of the job interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Answering incorrectly or refusing to answer can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This question is typically asked towards the end of an interview, especially for candidates the recruiter is interested in moving to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask

Recruiters genuinely want to know your [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_interviews | salary expectation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This question is not a trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The primary reasons include:
*   **Fitting within Salary Band** To determine if your expectations align with the established salary band for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This data is then included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Satisfaction** To ensure that if an offer is extended, you will accept it and be excited about the compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Accepting a salary below your expectation can lead to dissatisfaction and searching for other opportunities, which means the company might have to refill the position later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The salary question is important for both the candidate and the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Scenarios When Disclosing Salary Expectations

### Your Expectation is Higher Than the Company's Range
If your desired salary is too high for the role, you may be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Small Gap** If the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000 apart), there might be some pre-interview [[negotiation_strategies_with_recruiters_and_employers | negotiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Recruiters might explore your flexibility or suggest alternative offer structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Large Gap** If the difference is significant (e.g., $25,000 apart), the recruiter will likely conclude they cannot make a suitable offer and may suggest keeping you in mind for a future, more enriched role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidate Exception** For exceptionally talented candidates, a recruiter might still forward your resume and accurate [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_interviews | salary expectations]] to the hiring manager, suggesting they might consider enriching the role to match your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This is, however, an exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Honesty is Key** Always be honest with your expectations. Attempting a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Your Expectation is Lower Than the Company's Range
This is a favorable situation for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Major corporations have salary bands (minimum, midpoint, max) based on market wage surveys and internal equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Internal Equity** This concept ensures that individuals in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Automatic Adjustment** If your compensation expectation is below the lowest point of the company's salary range, your offer will automatically be adjusted up to that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This often occurs when candidates come from smaller or less reputable companies that don't have the same salary structures, or when stepping into a higher-level role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Refusing to Answer
If you give vague or evasive answers, you will almost always be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Recruiters will not put you through the interview process without knowing if a deal can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Avoiding the question can also make the recruiter suspect you are hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## How to Prepare Your Answer

Before you answer, you need to know three key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:
1.  **Average Salary Range for the Role** Research the market value for similar roles using tools like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Ensure you compare jobs in your local area, as salaries vary significantly by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **What the Company Expects to Pay** While this may not always be explicitly stated, understanding the company's typical compensation philosophy is helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom Line Salary Expectation** Identify the absolute minimum salary you are willing to accept. This is your walk-away number, though you won't necessarily share it with the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Strategies for Answering the Question

### 1. Directly State Your Expectation
If you know your worth and are confident the company's range aligns with yours, you can simply provide your number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Be mindful that this number will stick with you through the rest of the process, so ensure it's reasonable and something you can live with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### 2. Frame with Market Research
If you suspect the company might offer a low amount, or if your expectations are much higher than what they might offer, frame your answer based on market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Example Phrase**: "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110,000. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   This approach puts the onus on the company to disclose if their compensation is below market value, allowing you to decide if you still want to pursue the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### 3. Put the Question Back on the Recruiter
If you are concerned about pricing yourself out or are open to a potentially lower salary for the right opportunity, try to get the recruiter to provide a range first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Example Phrase**: "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   Recruiters will often share what other candidates are being compensated at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, be prepared for them to push back, so still have an answer ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **Avoid Ambiguity**: Do not go through the interview process being ambiguous about your salary expectations, hoping to [[negotiation_strategies_with_recruiters_and_employers | negotiate]] later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This often annoys hiring managers if they cannot afford your expectations after investing time in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Don't Frustrate the Recruiter**: If you sense the recruiter is becoming frustrated by your lack of a direct answer, provide one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Overly avoiding the question can lead to being placed in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

A corporate recruiter is an internal professional who works directly for a company to fill open positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. With 20 years of experience interviewing and hiring thousands of people for large, well-known companies, a corporate recruiter offers a subjective ranking of job search methods based on their personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. The primary assumptions for this ranking are that job seekers aim to find a job as quickly as possible, spending the least amount of time for the biggest return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

    *   **Reasoning:** Blasting unsolicited connection requests is ineffective, similar to cold calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

    *   **Reasoning:** These opportunities generally offer a decent return on effort if you are a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Outward advertising suggests the company struggles to find applicants, increasing your chances of getting seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

    *   **Reasoning:** Internships provide a leg up on competition and a foot in the door with an organization, building goodwill and familiarizing you with the [[Recruiter and Hiring Manager Responsibilities | hiring manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.

*   **Industry Contacts (Score: 8/10)**
    *   **Recruiter's View:** This is a very powerful way to get a foot in the door, building on networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Reasoning:** Former bosses or close colleagues at other organizations can pull you along with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. This often bypasses a deep interview process and usually results in fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>.

*   **Employee Referrals (Score: 8/10)**
    *   **Recruiter's View:** If you know someone working at a company you're interested in, seek a referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Reasoning:** Employee referrals almost always get preference over external candidates, often skipping to the front of the interview line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

*   **Outbound Sourcing (Score: 10/10)**
    *   **Recruiter's View:** This is the recruiter's personal favorite and how most recruiters (80% or more) fill their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Recruiter's Role:** A recruiter actively goes into the market to find candidates who closely fit the profile the [[Recruiter and Hiring Manager Responsibilities | hiring manager]] is looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. They spend most of their time perusing LinkedIn and other places to find these candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Reasoning:** If a recruiter finds you, they will pull you directly to the front of the line, bypassing the full application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. Making yourself discoverable is the single best thing a job seeker can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.

## Maximizing Job Search Results

To maximize results, a job seeker should prioritize discoverability, improve their LinkedIn presence, network with the right people, leverage industry contacts, and seek employee referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. While less effective, applying to jobs on job boards should still be part of an active search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

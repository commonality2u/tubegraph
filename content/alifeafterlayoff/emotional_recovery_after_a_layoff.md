Getting laid off can be one of the most catastrophic things an individual experiences in their professional career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, often leading to a profound sense of loss and betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## The Immediate Shock

The experience often begins with an out-of-the-ordinary meeting invitation with your boss, followed by the appearance of HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Before you can comprehend what's happening, a pre-canned speech begins, explaining the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. During this moment, "the world seems to stop spinning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and you enter a [[emotional_and_psychological_effects_of_layoffs | state of shock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Most people feel "dumbfounded" and speechless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The harsh reality quickly sets in:
*   Loss of computer access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Loss of email access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   No longer part of the "family" pitched in team meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

This sudden disconnect can be profoundly shocking, feeling like a "betrayal of trust" and "honesty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It can lead to feelings of worthlessness, self-doubt, and overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Processing Grief and Healing

It is perfectly normal to go into a [[emotional_and_psychological_effects_of_layoffs | state of shock]] and experience a mourning process, as a layoff is a very real loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. There are stages of grief that you will need to go through and process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> If you are laid off on a Wednesday or Thursday, consider taking the rest of the week off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Activities like a long drive or a nature hike can help clear your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

It is crucial to process what happened to you and allow yourself to go through these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This includes:
*   Getting angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   Getting mad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Second-guessing yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>

Boiling these emotions to the surface is "completely healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>; bottling them up will only make things worse in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. You must accept that you are wounded and need time to heal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

While it's important to spend the appropriate amount of time healing, you cannot stay in that space for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, as practical steps will eventually need to be taken.

## Avoiding Panic and Seeking Support

It is easy to start panicking during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. However, remember that "everything will be okay as long as you take the appropriate steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

During job searching and interviewing, the weight of unemployment can be immense, creating intense pressure and nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. If you find yourself struggling, panicking, or "going on tilt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, it is crucial to get the help you need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Resources like career coaches, job search advice, and interview guidance can provide critical support during this challenging period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

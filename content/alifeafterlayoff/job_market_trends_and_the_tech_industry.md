The labor market has experienced a significant softening in recent months, with widespread layoffs, particularly within the [[impact_of_layoffs_on_tech_job_market | tech industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This trend is expected to [[job_market_trends_and_misleading_job_statistics | spill over into other industries]] as 2023 progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Companies, it appears, have not learned from past mistakes in treating employees with dignity and respect during the employment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Unprofessional Handling of Layoffs

Despite a recent [[current_economic_trends_and_job_hopping | economic boom]] that saw rampant hiring and significant wage increases, especially in tech, the market proved unsustainable, and the "bottom fell out" rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This has led to companies [[impact_of_layoffs_on_tech_job_market | handling layoffs in extremely unprofessional manners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Examples of such practices include:
*   **Google Badge Access Revocation** An employee of over 10 years, forced to return to the office, discovered their layoff when their building badge no longer worked upon arrival, with no prior notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Layoffs During Business Trips** Individuals on company business trips were notified of their layoff mid-trip, leaving them stranded and embarrassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Layoffs During Labor** A particularly egregious case involved a person being laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Employment** An individual who left their previous company to join Google was laid off after only 13 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This highlights a lack of [[job_market_instability_and_frequent_layoffs | accountability for disrupting people's lives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

These instances demonstrate [[market_instability_and_employment_trends | extremely poor corporate behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While some may not sympathize with those laid off from high-paying tech companies like Google or Amazon, it's argued that individuals should always aim to earn the most they can in their profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Companies are criticized for hiring recklessly, viewing employees merely as "numbers on a spreadsheet" rather than individuals with lives, families, and aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. When an employee is no longer deemed useful, their position is eliminated without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Acting Like a Free Agent in Your Career

Individuals are encouraged to hold companies accountable by carefully choosing where to work, especially if a company has demonstrated poor behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. An example is Zillow, which laid off recruiting staff only to repost the same jobs shortly after, without rehiring the previous employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The concept of "corporate loyalty is dead," having ended with the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The days of working for decades at one company for a pension are gone; the modern workforce is characterized by "what have you done for me lately" and instant gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Layoffs occur when things get tough, followed by rushed rehiring, creating a cycle of [[job_market_instability_and_frequent_layoffs | instability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

To navigate this environment, individuals must adopt a "free agent" mindset, prioritizing their own best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Being "selfish" in one's [[career_market_trends_and_testing_the_market | career]] is necessary because no one else will prioritize an individual's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Case Study: A Personal Story of "Free Agency"
An individual laid off in November unexpectedly, swiftly updated their resume and LinkedIn profile, and learned effective networking strategies to bypass recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This led to multiple job offers, including one that offered a $50,000 raise, secured within about five weeks of unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Despite accepting an offer, the individual was advised to continue with final interview rounds for another company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. After starting the new job, this second company presented an even stronger offer, a further $30,000-$40,000 increase, making it nearly $100,000 more than the original job from which they were laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The advice given was to "act like a free agent" and take the better opportunity, as an employee owes their employer nothing more than an honest day's work for an honest day's pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

This narrative underscores the importance of continuously thinking for oneself and prioritizing personal [[career_resilience_and_job_search_strategies_in_tech | career goals]] in a [[current_job_market_challenges | competitive market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

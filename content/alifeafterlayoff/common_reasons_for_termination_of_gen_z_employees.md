Recent data indicates that bosses are terminating Gen Z workers at a high rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trend is supported by various reasons, many stemming from observed behaviors and perceived cultural disconnects in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Survey Findings on Gen Z Hires
A survey conducted by intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders engaged in hiring decisions, explored their attitudes towards recent college graduates (Gen Z workforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Hiring Rate:** 75% of companies reported having hired some Gen Z employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Termination Rate:** A significant 6 out of 10 companies admitted to firing a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Frequently Cited Issues by Employers
According to the study, 75% of companies reported at least one issue with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The most common reasons why these new hires did not succeed include:
*   Lack of motivation or initiative (50% of employers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Lack of professionalism (nearly 46%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Lacking organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Lacking communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Challenges with feedback or not taking feedback well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Lack of relevant work experience (though this poses a [[job_market_challenges_for_gen_z_in_2024 | "chicken or the egg"]] dilemma for entry-level roles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Poor problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Insufficient technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Bad culture fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Difficulty working in a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

These factors suggest that companies are hiring Gen Z for entry-level positions but are quick to terminate them if there's a perceived cultural mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This indicates that employers are "slow to hire, quick to fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Employer Beliefs and Perceptions
Hiring managers hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:
*   **Entitlement:** Approximately 65-70% believe Gen Z is entitled, often seeking rapid promotions and high salaries without sufficient skill or demonstrated experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Easily Offended:** About 65% believe Gen Z gets offended easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of Work Ethic:** A significant percentage note a lack of work ethic and poor response to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Unpreparedness:** Many feel they are unprepared for the workforce, despite significant investment in college degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This points to a cultural disconnect, with universities not adequately preparing students for the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Cost of Training:** Employers also perceive Gen Z as costing more to train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technical Skills:** Surprisingly, 28% reported a lack of technological skills, which is counterintuitive for a generation that grew up with advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Observed Unprofessional Behaviors
Specific behaviors that often lead to termination include:
*   Inability to manage workload (1 in 5 respondents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
*   Unprofessionalism, including being late to start work (20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
*   Not dressing professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
*   Not using appropriate language at work (19%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>
*   Frequent lateness to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
*   Handing in assignments late (17%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

These behaviors are often the fastest way to a performance improvement plan and eventual termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Case Studies and Anecdotal Evidence
Several firsthand accounts from employers and Gen Z individuals illustrate these [[signs_of_potential_termination_at_work | signs of potential termination]]:

*   **Construction Company Owner:** Reported that young people (under 30) often lack communication skills, critical thinking, motivation, attention to detail, and persistence. They also struggle to put down their phones and focus for more than 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Emergency Department Nurse:** An employer shared an instance of a new nurse graduate who was constantly on her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and even texted friends about patients. When her phone was taken away, she had a "tantrum" and ultimately chose her phone over her job. This led to the department stopping the hiring of new nurse grads, negatively impacting those with good work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Accounting Professional:** A Gen Z individual recounted being fired from two accounting roles. In the first, she was frequently on her phone due to boredom and perceived a [[negative_workplace_culture | negative workplace culture]] with "snitches" and micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. In the second, she was fired for perceived lateness based on an "all-star employee's" complaints, despite her contract allowing flexible start times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. She eventually learned from these experiences and found a more suitable career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **IT Professional:** A government IT professional observed that computer science graduates in entry-level positions lasted less than 6 months, exhibiting similar issues: lack of focus, attention, communication, urgency, and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **"Quiet Quitting" Instance:** One Gen Z individual humorously admitted to being fired after 15 months of "not doing anything," highlighting a quiet quitting mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This behavior is less tolerated in today's job market due to increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Employer Demands and What Makes Gen Z Hirable
Employers are clear about what they seek in new hires:
*   Stronger work ethic and a better attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Initiative and positive attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
*   Adaptability and openness to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   Punctuality and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Solid technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   Strong interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Internship experience (highly recommended for students) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
*   Work-appropriate social media presence, as employers often check candidates' online profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   Avoiding political topics in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>

## Nuance and Context
While the data presents significant [[challenges_gen_z_workers_face_in_the_workplace | challenges for Gen Z workers in the workplace]], it's important to remember that these are not blanket statements for the entire generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Many Gen Z individuals are highly motivated, driven, and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

Historically, every new generation entering the workforce has faced similar criticism from older generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Furthermore, Gen Z has entered one of the most difficult [[job_market_challenges_for_gen_z_in_2024 | job market challenges for Gen Z in 2024]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, and they are also credited with driving positive changes, such as a greater emphasis on work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

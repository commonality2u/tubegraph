## Wells Fargo Employee Found Deceased at Desk

A 60-year-old Wells Fargo employee, Denise Prudhomme, was discovered deceased at her desk in the company's corporate office building in Tempe, Arizona, four days after she had clocked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Prudhomme entered the building on Friday, August 16th, at 7:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It was not until Tuesday, August 20th, that building security called officials after a "subject down" was reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Incident Details

An employee, speaking anonymously, stated that a colleague found Prudhomme dead in her cubicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead at 4:55 p.m. upon their arrival, suggesting she had been deceased for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Her cubicle was located on the third floor, "tucked away" from the main aisle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Multiple individuals had reportedly complained about a foul odor, which they attributed to plumbing issues, failing to realize the severity of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Employee Neglect and Corporate Responsibility

The prolonged period without anyone noticing Prudhomme's absence or condition has raised significant concerns about [[Corporate negligence and workplace culture | corporate negligence and workplace culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. One employee expressed heartbreak, wondering if anyone would check on them if they were in a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The thought of someone spending their final moments at a desk and being forgotten was described as sickening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The incident highlights a severe lack of human connection and oversight within the workplace. No one seemed to notice that Denise had been absent from meetings, or that her reporting wasn't submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. She was described as "so invisible" that no one stopped by to socialize or invite her to lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

A Wells Fargo spokesman released a statement expressing deep sadness and offering thoughts and prayers to the family, along with access to counselors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. They also confirmed cooperation with the police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. While foul play was not suspected, the incident is believed to be a health event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Corporate Culture Under Scrutiny

The incident brings into question the nature of the [[Company culture and employee morale | corporate culture]] at Wells Fargo, particularly in the finance industry which has been "very adamant about forcing people back into the office" for "collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The apparent lack of "collaboration" in this case, with an employee "literally rotting away on the third floor by herself in a cube," underscores a broken system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Concerns were also raised about whether janitorial staff or others might have noticed her presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

There is a call for bosses to be held [[Importance of company accountability in hiring and layoffs | accountable]], questioning how they could be unaware that an employee was in the building, never left, and had died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The speaker also suggested that Prudhomme's work might not have been valued if her absence went unnoticed for so long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Lessons and Reflections

This tragic event serves as a stark reminder for employees to prioritize their own wellbeing and [[Employee value and workplace respect | value]] themselves:

*   **Seek [[Employee value and workplace respect | Value]]**: If you feel [[Employee value and workplace respect | underappreciated]], seek a workplace that will notice your presence and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Health**: Place your health and wellness above all else; take sick days and vacations without guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Mortality**: Recognize that you never know when your last day will be, and it's hoped it won't be spent unnoticed in a cubicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The speaker notes that companies often quickly replace employees, suggesting the job might already be posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This emphasizes the perception that employees are often seen as "a cog in a wheel" or "a number on a spreadsheet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Ultimately, individuals are encouraged to [[Evaluating job security and company loyalty | reclaim control]] and "act like the CEO of your career" because "clearly nobody else is looking out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

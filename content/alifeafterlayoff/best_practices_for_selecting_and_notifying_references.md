When job searching, you may be asked to provide references. It's important to understand how [[the_role_of_references_in_the_hiring_process | references are used in the hiring process]] and how to strategically select and prepare your contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Do Companies Check References?

The answer to whether companies check references is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This practice is more commonly seen in [[how_smaller_and_larger_companies_handle_reference_checks | smaller companies]] or agencies that submit candidates to a [[how_smaller_and_larger_companies_handle_reference_checks | larger corporation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. They will likely follow through with calling your provided references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Typical Reference Check Questions

When a recruiter or HR professional contacts a reference, they typically ask a series of questions related to your job performance, work ethic, and attendance (especially for hourly positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. They may inquire about any concerns, your strengths and weaknesses, and most commonly, if you would be eligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Recruiters might have three to five standard questions for references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Challenges in Obtaining References

One of the [[challenges_and_strategies_for_providing_effective_references | difficulties in tracking down references]] can be getting them to return calls, which can delay the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Why Larger Companies are Reluctant to Give References

Many companies, especially larger ones, are reluctant to provide detailed references due to [[liability_concerns_associated_with_giving_references | liability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If a previous boss gives a negative reference that prevents someone from getting a job, it could open them up to legal action like slander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Human resources professionals aim to limit this exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

As a result, many large corporations instruct their employees, especially those with direct reports, not to give out references directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Instead, all requests are filtered back to the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. When HR responds, they typically only provide "name, rank, and serial number" â€“ meaning the person's name, dates of employment, and job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They generally do not give out compensation details, rehire eligibility, or reasons for termination to avoid further liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Generally, most major employers do not heavily weight reference checks, viewing them as a final check-off rather than a decisive factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If you reach the reference check stage, it's often a sign that a job offer is likely coming soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Best Practices for Providing References

If you are asked for references, take it seriously and put thought into your choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 1. Select Legitimate and Relevant Contacts

*   **Direct Manager**: Ideally, you should include at least one professional reference who was a direct manager, as their feedback is considered the most valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If possible, aim for three managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Customers or Higher-Level Colleagues**: If you can't provide multiple managers, choose someone who was a customer you directly supported (internal or external) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Alternatively, someone a level or two above you who can speak to your performance would be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Avoid Peers**: Do not list a peer who does the same job as you, as this is not as strong a reference as a manager or someone you supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### 2. Ensure They Will Give a Good Reference

It's crucial to select individuals who you are confident will provide a positive reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Recruiters have encountered situations where a candidate's reference gave a negative assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. If you are unsure if someone will give a good reference, do not include them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. You should generally know who you have good working relationships with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### 3. Notify Your References in Advance

*   **Get Permission**: Always ask for permission before listing someone as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Inform Them**: Tell your references that you are interviewing and that they might receive a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Most people willing to be a reference will be happy to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Avoid Delays**: Notifying your references prevents them from mistaking the call for spam, ensuring they return calls quickly and do not delay the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

By following these tips, you can effectively manage the reference check process and increase your chances of landing your next job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

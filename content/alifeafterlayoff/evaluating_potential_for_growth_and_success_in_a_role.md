When interviewing for a new position, it's crucial to actively screen the company and the role to ensure it aligns with your career goals and offers a strong foundation for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A bad job can set your career back significantly, making careful evaluation essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

As a job seeker, you should be interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The best candidates approach interviews with a slightly more aggressive mindset, asking pertinent questions to gather vital information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Key Questions for Assessing a Role's Potential

### Understanding the Role's Opening

Asking "Why is this position open?" provides significant insight into the department's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Previous employee's departure**: If the prior occupant was terminated, laid off, or quit, it indicates potential underlying issues within the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This requires further probing, such as inquiring why they quit or why they were terminated and what they were not successful in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This reconnaissance helps gather data points for an informed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Added headcount**: If the position is a new headcount, it signals growth within the department or company, generally a positive indicator for stability and opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Vision and Contribution

Inquire about the hiring manager's vision for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This helps understand their long-term perspective and the reasons behind creating the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Asking this early can provide an advantage, allowing you to tailor your interview answers to align with their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This question is part of [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles | evaluating job descriptions and roles]].

Ask about the department's weaknesses and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Follow up by asking how this role is expected to contribute to solving weaknesses or accentuating strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This helps you determine if your skills align with what the department needs and if you can make a meaningful impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Measuring Success

A critical question is, "How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This ensures that expectations are reasonable and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If the hiring manager's expectations seem misaligned with the role's realities, it's an opportunity to push back and clarify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Unreasonable expectations can lead to failure and quick turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

If there was a successful predecessor, ask, "What is it about that person that made them so successful in this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The answer provides a roadmap for your own success if you land the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Long-Term Growth Opportunities

For those aspiring to climb the career ladder, inquire about "potential growth opportunities in the long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While not immediately asking about promotions, it's reasonable to understand your long-term career path and ensure the role isn't a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Always show strong interest in the role you're currently interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Company Strategy and Stability

Understanding the organization's strategy is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. You don't want to join a company lacking strategic direction or one whose direction you don't believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Prior to the interview, research their main competitors and any new, industry-shaking technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Challenge them by asking, "How is this company planning to address [competitor's new product/process/idea] and stay in front of the market?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. A reputable company will be aware of competitors and have a strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A lack of awareness or direction is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Uncovering Deeper Concerns

A strategic question to gain deeper insight into the hiring manager's mind is, "If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Listening closely to their answer can reveal what's truly happening behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Interview Approach

Remember to engage the interviewer throughout the process; you don't need to wait until the end when they ask if you have questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. A two-way dialogue is the best way to ace an interview and gather the necessary information to make an informed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Being proactive in managing your career is essential for long-term success, especially when considering job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

In a challenging job market, job seekers often experience frustration, particularly on [[the_impact_of_linkedin_on_the_job_market | LinkedIn]], as they apply for numerous positions without securing interviews or job offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Recruiters observe this widespread frustration regarding job searches, especially with the high volume of layoffs, notably in the tech sector, leading to a significant influx of job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Why is it Hard to Get a Job?
The current job market, as of early 2023, feels akin to 2020, with numerous major corporations conducting layoffs and a scarcity of job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This situation is characterized by a significant supply of job seekers and low demand for talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Stiff Competition
The influx of laid-off workers, particularly from big tech (around 85,000 to 90,000 by February 2023), has intensified competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Job applications are significantly up; for instance, a VP-level tech role recently received 700 applications in just over 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Similarly, a remote tech recruiter position with a reasonable salary attracted 2,300 applicants within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## The Power of Discoverability and Networking
To navigate this competitive landscape, [[importance_of_networking_in_job_searching | networking effectively on LinkedIn]] and enhancing personal branding for discoverability are crucial. The most effective way to secure a job today is to be found by a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. It is considerably easier for recruiters to proactively find and engage candidates for the interview process than for individuals to apply to roles competing against potentially thousands of other applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Being Found by Recruiters
Achieving discoverability means positioning oneself where recruiters search, which is primarily [[the_impact_of_linkedin_on_the_job_market | LinkedIn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. [[Networking_effectively_on_linkedin | Building strong networks]] on LinkedIn is a key method for becoming highly discoverable to recruiters and accessing the hidden job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

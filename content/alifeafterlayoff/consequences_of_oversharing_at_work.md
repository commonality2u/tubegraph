Oversharing at work, even seemingly innocent comments, can lead to significant professional repercussions, impacting credibility and career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. It is crucial to be cautious about who you trust and what you share in a professional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Oversharing

An HR professional's first job involved being an HR generalist in a manufacturing and global engineering company, which required frequent travel and rotations to different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. During one rotation in a small town, the professional became friendly with a line worker, leading to conversations outside of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. At a bar with friends, the conversation turned to work, and the line worker asked about a new, inexperienced supervisor named Joe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The HR professional made a comment they considered innocent: "Yeah Joe's doing well he's relatively new to his role so he's still growing and I'm helping him with some things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The following week, the HR professional's boss received a call from Joe, who was upset that rumors were being spread about him not being a good leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. The line worker had gone directly to Joe's office, claiming the HR professional had stated, "Brian doesn't have any faith in you as a leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

This incident forced the HR professional to apologize profusely to Joe and learn a difficult lesson about trusting coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

> "The moral of this story is I learned the hard way that you have to be very careful with people that you choose to be friendly with at work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Negative Impacts of Oversharing

*   **Credibility Issues**: When oversharing, even innocently, information tends to circulate back to management, potentially leading to a reputation of being untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This can majorly impact one's long-term career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Association with [[gossip_and_negative_comments_at_work | Office Gossip]]**: Hanging out with people known for [[gossip_and_negative_comments_at_work | gossiping]] can lead to being branded as an [[gossip_and_negative_comments_at_work | office gossip]] yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Leaders are aware of workplace cliques, and being associated with gossips can hinder career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Exposure to Negativity**: Spending too much time with negative coworkers, who constantly complain about the boss, company, or pay, can inevitably drag you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. These individuals can be a "cancer" in a group, especially for those focused on upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Compromised Future Positions**: If you form close friendships with coworkers and then get promoted over them, it can create an awkward and competitive dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Shared "dirty secrets" can be used by unscrupulous coworkers to compromise or hold you "hostage," potentially holding back your progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   **Risk of Harassment or Offending Others**: Be extremely cautious at happy hours or other out-of-work events with coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Alcohol can lead to "loose lips" and being "too touchy-feely," blurring the line between friendliness and harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. An off-color joke, for example, can offend someone without your knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. As a common adage in HR states, "anything that you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While forming friendships at work is possible and common, it's essential to "pick and choose your friends very carefully" and be highly cautious about behavior, statements, and shared information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Avoid [[gossip_and_negative_comments_at_work | office gossip]] and negative influences to protect your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

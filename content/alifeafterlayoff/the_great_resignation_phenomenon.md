The [[great_resignation_and_its_impact | Great Resignation]] is a significant phenomenon gripping the world's workforce, characterized by people voluntarily leaving their jobs en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This wave of resignations is a direct result of global events over the past 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Scale and Impact

Research by Microsoft indicates that up to 41% of currently working individuals plan to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The U.S. Labor Department reported a record four million people quit their jobs in April 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This mass exodus occurred even when the labor market was still quite uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The [[Impact of the Great Resignation | impact]] of the [[great_resignation_extension | Great Resignation extension]] has created a "buyer's market" for job seekers, especially at the hourly level, but also to a degree at the professional level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Driving Factors Behind the Great Resignation

### Re-evaluation of Work and Life
Many individuals began to see their lives differently, realizing how much time was spent commuting and in an office setting that might not have been necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This period forced a recalibration of priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, with people questioning if the traditional work model was still right for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Remote Work Realities
Before the pandemic, remote work often carried a stigma, suggesting remote employees were less dedicated or hardworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Despite this perception, many remote workers, including the speaker, often worked more hours than when in an office, due to the elimination of commute time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The shift to widespread remote work in 2020 demonstrated that many positions, particularly white-collar professional roles, could effectively be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Companies were forced to adapt their traditional work models, leading to the realization that much more work than previously thought could be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Unexpected Challenges
The sudden closure of schools and the need for homeschooling created unforeseen challenges, and companies varied in their flexibility and accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Corporate Overcorrection and Burnout
Many companies overcorrected with layoffs during 2020-2021, anticipating a greater impact on their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. As the market recovered faster than expected, remaining employees were burdened with significant extra work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This, combined with constant digital meetings and calls, led to widespread "digital burnout" and exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Many individuals are just "fed up" with rigid companies and antiquated business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. A significant number of those seeking career coaching are gainfully employed but dissatisfied and unwilling to continue with current company or career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Employer Adaptation and the "Employment Experience"

Companies that remain rigid in their philosophy regarding return-to-office, remote work, and flexibility will struggle to be competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Flexibility, work-life balance, and remote work are no longer competitive advantages but rather a new standard; companies that fail to offer them will be at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Companies are now challenged to prioritize "employment experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes people's work and lives, including productivity, flexibility, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. To remain competitive in the labor market, companies must offer these as part of their benefits package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

Key aspects companies need to consider for competitive employment experiences:
*   **Flexibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>
*   **Competitive Salary, Compensation, and Benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>
*   **Clear Career Paths** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
*   **Work-Life Balance** (avoiding 60-70 hour work weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
*   **Full-time Employment** over contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
*   **Flexible Work Arrangements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>

## Redefining Priorities

The [[Impact of the Great Resignation | Great Resignation]] signifies a redefinition of priorities within the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. More individuals are making complete career 180s and trying something entirely different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This shift is forcing companies to adapt, which is ultimately seen as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

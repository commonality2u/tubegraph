A significant [[red_flags_in_job_descriptions | red flag]] in job interviews occurs when the job being discussed does not align with the job description that was advertised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## What it Means
You might apply for a position that sounds like a great fit based on its description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, during the interview with the hiring manager, the job responsibilities or focus may appear to have shifted significantly to something entirely different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This can also manifest as the employer initially envisioning you working on tasks unrelated to the job title, with a promise to transition you into the advertised role after several months (e.g., six to nine months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Why it's a [[Common red flags in job descriptions | Red Flag]]
*   **Bait and Switch Tactic**
    *   The likelihood of actually moving into the job that was originally advertised is very slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   [[Identifying lowquality job postings | Poor quality employers]] commonly use this "bait and switch" approach to attract candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Misalignment and Future Problems**
    *   An obvious disconnect between what the hiring manager expects and what the external job advertisement states indicates that you will encounter more problems if you accept the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   [[Identifying lowquality job postings | Low quality employers]] often conceal or "sugarcoat" the less desirable aspects of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

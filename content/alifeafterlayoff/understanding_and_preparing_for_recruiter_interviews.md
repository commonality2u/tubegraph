This article provides [[key_interview_cues_and_their_meanings_from_corporate_recruiters | insider information]] from a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, aiming to help job seekers understand what recruiters truly mean during interviews and how to best position themselves for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Types of Recruiters

It's important to distinguish between two main types of recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:

1.  **Headhunters (Third-Party Recruiters)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:
    *   Contracted by companies on a contingency basis, meaning they are paid upon successful placement of a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   Their fee is typically 15% to 25% of the hired candidate's first-year income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
    *   May not have the same level of in-depth knowledge about the specific role as an internal recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

2.  **Corporate Recruiters (Internal Recruiters)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>:
    *   Full-time employees of the company, often part of a talent acquisition department under HR or a standalone department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Their primary job is to find the best possible talent and fit for their [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   They typically support specific functional groups and work repeatedly with the same [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring managers]], fostering strong relationships and alignment on position requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   The first interview with a corporate recruiter is usually a screening interview to assess baseline competencies for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   The insider information shared in this article is specifically geared towards the internal corporate recruiter's interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Recruiter Says vs. What They Actually Mean

Understanding these cues can provide an advantage in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### "What do you know about the company?"

*   **What they say:** A standard opening question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** This assesses your level of interest and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   > [!WARNING] Red Flag
        > Walking into the interview without understanding what the company does or the position is a red flag against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   > [!TIP] Preparation
        > [[preparing_for_interviews_with_targeted_responses | Come prepared]] with knowledge about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### "Do you have a specific skill or experience?"

*   **What they say:** Assessing if you possess baseline competencies for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** These are requirements the [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring manager]] absolutely needs to see on your resume for you to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   If you lack a specific competency, it's likely you won't move to the next round, though exceptions exist if you bring other valuable attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Recruiter Rephrasing Questions Repeatedly

*   **What they say:** Trying to clarify the question for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** You are likely missing the mark with your answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   > [!TIP] Adjust Your Approach
        > Stop, listen carefully, and [[preparing_for_interviews_with_targeted_responses | recalculate your answer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Each question is tailored to assess a specific competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
        > It's acceptable to ask for clarification: "Can you please give me an idea of what it is that you're looking for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Candidate Rambling Without Follow-Up Questions

*   **What they say:** Nothing, they just listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** You are almost certainly moving to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   > [!WARNING] The Kiss of Death
        > Long-windedness is generally the "kiss of death" in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Recruiters rarely send candidates forward who are overly verbose and don't answer concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
        > This indicates to [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring managers]] a potential inability to [[effective_communication_during_interviews | effectively communicate and influence senior business leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   > [!TIP] Be Concise
        > [[effective_communication_during_interviews | Answer questions directly and concisely]] and let the interviewer probe for more information if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### "What is your compensation expectation?"

*   **What they say:** Asking about your salary requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **What they mean (if they *don't* ask):** You are almost certainly in the "no" pile; they've already determined you're not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **What they mean (if they *do* ask and it's higher):** They will inform you if your expectation is higher than their range, and might ask if you're open to the lower range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   > [!NOTE] Significant Discrepancy
        > If your expectation is drastically (e.g., $10,000-$15,000) apart, they might say, "This position is scoped a little lower than you're expecting. If you don't mind, I'll give you a call when I have a more enriched role." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
        > This is their way of saying they can't afford you, and it's likely a role you wouldn't want anyway due to the low compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   > [!TIP] [[how_to_prepare_for_salary_discussions_in_interviews | Salary Discussion]]
        > Be honest but also stand firm in your realistic requirements, armed with good data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### "Do you have any questions for me?"

*   **What they say:** Inviting you to ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** The interview is effectively over, and they likely already know if they're sending you to the [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   > [!NOTE] It's a Formality
        > No amount of selling yourself at this point will change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It's an opportunity for you to get information to make an informed decision about the role and company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

They are already trying to pre-sell you for a potential offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Interview Wraps Up in 10-15 Minutes

*   **What they say:** Ending the interview quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** You are likely not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Recruiters often know within five to seven minutes whether a candidate is a decent fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   > [!TIP] Make a Strong First Impression

    *   A particularly good candidate will be "pre-sold" for the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

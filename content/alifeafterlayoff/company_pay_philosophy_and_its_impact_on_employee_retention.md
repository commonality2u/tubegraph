It is advisable for individuals to consistently assess the job market, even if they are satisfied with their current role, ideally at least once every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This proactive approach helps prevent complacency and ensures that individuals do not fall behind market rates for both [[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | career progression]] and [[pay_and_benefits_evaluation | compensation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Cost of Complacency

Staying in a job for an extended period can lead to being overlooked by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Companies may underpay employees significantly, especially if there are no complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Recruiters often observe internal pay equity issues, where entire departments can be 20-30% below market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Anecdotal Evidence: The $15/Hour Raise

A professional in the medical field, a top performer for seven to eight years, found her department experiencing nearly 100% [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Despite being happy, she tested the market and received an offer for $5 more per hour, albeit with a longer commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Upon informing her current employer of her intent to leave, she received a substantial $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

This situation raises questions about why employers often wait until an employee is tendering their resignation to offer proper [[pay_and_benefits_evaluation | compensation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It suggests a combination of the employee being underpaid and the company's desire to [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | retain]] top talent in a tight labor market where employees are no longer tolerating underpayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Company Pay Philosophies

Companies generally adopt one of two pay philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>:

*   **Pay Leaders:** These companies aim to be proactive in [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | retaining]] talent by paying competitively or above market rates, often enabling them to attract talent from other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggards:** These companies have a [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | compensation]] model that implicitly accepts higher [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

However, a consistent high rate of [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] ultimately becomes more expensive due to recruiting costs, training new employees, and the loss of "tribal knowledge" and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The Counter-Offer Conundrum

While generally not recommended, accepting a counter-offer, especially a significant one like $15 an hour, can be appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Employees may choose to stay due to comfort, established equity (like vacation time and 401ks), familiarity with co-workers, and existing work processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Onboarding at a new company can be challenging, and sometimes "the grass is not greener," leading to employees "boomeranging" back to previous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Strategies for Maintaining Market Value

To ensure you are properly valued and compensated, consider the following strategies:

*   **Regular Market Assessment:** Every two years, at a minimum, engage with the open job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This includes submitting applications and networking with recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Understand Market Trends:** Going through the interview process helps you understand current skills in demand, how companies assess candidates, and market [[pay_and_benefits_evaluation | compensation]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Combat Wage Stagnation:** Internal promotional raises (5-10%) often lag behind market-driven external raises (10-20%) for new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Relying solely on small cost-of-living adjustments (1-3%) means losing purchasing power due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Leverage Offers Carefully:** While understanding your market value is crucial, don't use every minor offer to demand a raise from your current employer, as they may eventually call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Be Proactive:** If you stay in the same role for more than two or three years without significant [[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | career advancement]] or raises, the market has likely surpassed your [[pay_and_benefits_evaluation | compensation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Proactively dabbling in the market ensures you stay "on the up and up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Staying informed about the dynamic job market is more critical than ever to ensure you are appropriately valued and to take ownership of your [[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

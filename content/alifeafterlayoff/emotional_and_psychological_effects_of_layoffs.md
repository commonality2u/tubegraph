There is no such thing as "surviving" a layoff; everyone involved is affected by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Despite companies expecting business to return to usual, layoffs represent a "massive trauma" for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Myth of "Surviving" a Layoff

The idea of "surviving a layoff" has become pervasive, particularly over the last 18 months, as more companies engage in multiple rounds of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Many employees whose names are not selected in the initial rounds express relief at having "survived" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, the reality is that layoffs cause a true severing of the relationship between employees and the company, a brutal experience for everyone involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Impact on Laid-Off Employees
Individuals who are laid off often have no chance to say goodbye to colleagues they knew closely, leading to a fractured situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Their lives can feel torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This lack of closure and sudden departure contributes to the traumatic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Impact on Remaining Employees ("Survivors")
Employees who retain their jobs after a layoff often feel they have "dodged a bullet" and are simply happy to still have a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, their [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | experiences of layoffs and company handling]] can significantly change:
*   **Increased Workload and Expectations** The workload often remains the same, or even doubles overnight, with customers expecting the same output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Employees may not complain for fear of being on the next layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Fear and Insecurity** The feeling of being "safe" is an illusion. Employees may initially believe they are safe or that their job has a good fit, but seeing others (who were not performance-related issues) laid off creates paranoia and concern about their own stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Trust and [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | Workplace Culture]]** There is no way the [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | corporate culture]] established before the layoffs can remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Trust in management and the company's commitment to employees diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, as companies might say one thing but do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This breaks the sense of security and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Companies Behaving Poorly During Layoffs
Many companies exhibit questionable behavior during layoffs, further exacerbating the [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | emotional effects]] on employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency** Companies often convey misleading information, using buzzwords in town hall meetings, claiming "everything is going great" or "we're not thinking layoffs," while simultaneously conducting layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Impersonal Notification Methods** Employees may find out about layoffs through their badge no longer swiping, being locked out of equipment, or via mass Zoom calls and pre-recorded messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Examples of Poor Handling**
    *   **LinkedIn Layoff:** A list of 600-700 employees to be laid off was accidentally leaked to the employee population via a public server on a Friday, only to be scrubbed by Sunday. All names on the list were indeed laid off the following Monday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   **Zoom Layoff without Severance:** One Tik Tok video showed a person being laid off via Zoom, alongside 800 other people in a teleservices division, with no severance offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Layoffs in Profitable Companies** Surprisingly, companies that are highly profitable and announce major deals may still cut their workforces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This highlights a pervasive lack of job security in today's workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Rehiring Practices** Companies often engage in knee-jerk reactions, laying off staff, only to rehire for similar positions months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. These new postings are frequently for contract positions, potentially paying 40% of the original rate with no benefits, replacing previously full-time roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This cycle prevents employees from putting "a stake in the ground" in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Long-Term [[impact_of_layoffs_on_career_momentum | Career Momentum]] and Mental Health
The current landscape of frequent [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | corporate layoffs and their effects on employees]] makes it difficult for individuals to gain [[impact_of_layoffs_on_career_momentum | traction in a career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. It's no longer common to work for one or two employers for an entire career and collect a pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Some individuals have reported being laid off three or four times in a single year, even without performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

### Serious Mental Health Impacts
The [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | emotional recovery after a layoff]] can be severe. Layoffs can have a profound mental health impact, with some individuals taking "pretty permanent steps" due to the drastic effects on their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This highlights the critical need for [[strategies_for_coping_with_layoffs | strategies for coping with layoffs]] and support.

## Proactive Steps for Employees
Given the current climate, employees should not assume they are safe or "too unique" to be impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. If a company is conducting mass layoffs, especially in questionable ways, it should be a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

> [!INFO] "There's no such thing as a survivor of a layoff." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>

Employees are encouraged to take proactive steps:
*   **Act as the CEO of Your Career** Recognize that your company may not have your back or be trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Update Resume and Network** Start strengthening your resume and networking defensively, or even offensively, to explore other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Due Diligence During Job Interviews** When interviewing with new companies, ask questions about their history of layoffs, how they were handled, and if the position being offered was previously affected by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Challenge them on why a position is being replaced so soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

Taking ownership of one's career and being prepared can help avoid being caught off guard, especially as [[personal_stories_of_layoffs_and_their_coping_mechanisms | personal stories of layoffs and their coping mechanisms]] reveal individuals losing both old steady jobs and new jobs within a month, leading to unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

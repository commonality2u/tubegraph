Being caught in a [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]] can be a significant ego hit, leading to self-doubt about why one was selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, in many cases, layoffs are not the employee's fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Companies typically have specific criteria for determining which employees are put on the [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | layoff]] list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Reasons Companies Select Employees for Layoffs

### Performance-Related Issues
One of the most common reasons people assume for a layoff is [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Companies may target employees whose performance is lower than their team, department, or similar roles across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This often involves looking at measurable metrics like overall output or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Indicators for potential layoffs based on performance include:
*   **Tracking below teammates** Visible performance boards can show if an employee is consistently underperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Performance appraisal ratings** Companies often review performance appraisal data and target the lowest performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Nine-box grid placement** Managers might use a nine-box ranking system, with those in the bottom quadrants typically ending up on the [[performance_and_layoffs | layoff]] list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Seniority
Another significant factor in layoffs is [[seniority_and_impact_on_layoffs | seniority]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Often, companies employ a "last in, first out" mentality, targeting recently tenured employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This presents a risk for individuals leaving a stable position for a new role, as they may become the "low person on the totem pole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, [[seniority_and_impact_on_layoffs | seniority]] alone is not enough to guarantee protection if an employee's performance is lower than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Obsolete Skills or Roles
Layoffs can occur due to an employee's skills becoming obsolete or their specific role no longer being needed by the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If a company has evolved beyond certain skills or job types and an employee hasn't adapted with the market, they may face a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Keeping up with industry trends, market demands for software and technical skills, and company evolution is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The rise of AI in the workplace is expected to accelerate this trend, emphasizing the need to adapt or risk being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Departmental Need and Strategic Shifts
Layoffs frequently result from changes in departmental needs, especially common in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This happens when a department shifts its focus, de-emphasizes certain products or groups, or eliminates roles due to changes in the organization's strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Even top performers or recently promoted individuals can be affected if their division's strategic direction changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While unpredictable, employees can de-risk this by avoiding experimental projects or divisions not core to the business or not generating significant revenue, as these are often the first to be eliminated during times of [[impact_of_economic_downturns_and_layoffs | economic uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Cost-Cutting Measures
[[Impact of economic downturns and layoffs | Cost-cutting measures]] are a major reason for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This often targets:
*   **Experimental or unprofitable divisions** Employees in these areas may be laid off or the projects de-emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **High-earning employees** Companies may specifically look for individuals making the most money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Senior employees with atrophied skills** Older, senior employees who earn high salaries but whose skills haven't kept pace with the market may be replaced by cheaper alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Payroll is one of a company's largest expenses, making it a primary target for scrutiny during [[current_surge_in_layoffs_and_economic_factors | economic uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Disruptive technologies like AI can also lead to the elimination of positions, further contributing to cost-cutting layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Voluntary Severance Programs
Companies sometimes offer voluntary severance programs, presenting lucrative packages for early retirement or attractive deals to encourage a portion of the workforce to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This is done to reduce the workforce without resorting to forced layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. If not enough employees opt for voluntary severance, the company will then use other criteria to select individuals for forced layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
While not always openly discussed, [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | legal and ethical considerations]] can influence layoff decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This may include unspoken targeting of certain groups, such as age-based discrimination (e.g., against older employees often referred to as "dinosaurs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Other protected classes like gender, creed, or color can also be factors for unscrupulous companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Reclaiming Control After a Layoff
Layoffs can derail a promising career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. However, being laid off does not mean one is "damaged goods" or necessarily implies a [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. It's crucial for individuals to reclaim control by acting as the CEO of their own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Strategies include:
*   **Building in-demand skill sets** Focus on skills valued by the broader market, not just the current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Maintaining an up-to-date resume** Continuously update your resume and explore other opportunities that align with long-term career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Networking** Actively network, even with competitors, to build strong industry connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Targeted networking can lead to better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Developing multiple streams of income** This is vital for reducing dependence on a single employer, granting more control over one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

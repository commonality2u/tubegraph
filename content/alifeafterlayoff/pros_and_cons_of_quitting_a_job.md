Quitting your job means leaving on your own terms, which is often seen as the ultimate act of a "free agent" in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This proactive step allows you to take ownership of your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Advantages of Quitting

*   **Control and Proactivity**
    *   You are leaving on your own terms, choosing carefully when to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Making a proactive move can lead to bettering yourself, especially if you've been with a company for a long time and the market has passed you by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Financial & Career Growth**
    *   Quitting often allows you to secure a new job beforehand, ensuring you are fully prepared for the transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   You are likely to see bigger pay increases by testing the open market outside your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Job Search & Interview Benefits**
    *   It is much easier to secure another job when you are currently employed, as there is less pressure to take the first offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   Being employed during interviews leads to less stress, allowing you to relax, sell yourself more easily, and have greater negotiating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   You have the initiative to spin the reason for your departure positively in an interview, as you likely have a strong reason for quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Quitting generally provides the best strength in an interview setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Potential for Rehire**
    *   If you [[proper_way_to_quit_a_job | properly quit your job]] without burning bridges, you may be eligible for rehire, which can serve as a valuable safety net if a new job doesn't work out or the economy worsens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Quitting

*   **Burning Bridges**
    *   If you fail to [[proper_way_to_quit_a_job | properly quit your job]] and burn bridges, you may not be eligible for rehire at your old company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   You will also likely not receive positive references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Implications**
    *   You will not receive any severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   Voluntarily leaving your job generally makes you ineligible for unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. However, there might be exceptions if you left due to a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of New Employment**
    *   There's a risk that the "grass isn't greener," meaning the new employer might be similar to the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   Your previous job might be filled, making a return impossible if the new situation doesn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Scenarios Where Quitting Might Not Be Ideal

*   **Facing Performance Issues:** If you are being documented for poor performance, are on a performance improvement plan (PIP), and the issues are strictly performance-related (e.g., not a good fit for the job), it might be better to be terminated. Being fired for performance reasons can still make you eligible for unemployment and potentially a continuation of benefits, without a real advantage to quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Anticipating Layoffs:** If you know your industry or the broader market is softening and your company hasn't announced layoffs yet, it may be beneficial to wait before quitting. Quitting just before a major layoff could mean missing out on a potentially hefty severance package you would have received if laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Ultimately, while quitting offers control and a stronger position in future job searches, employers still expect good reasons for your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

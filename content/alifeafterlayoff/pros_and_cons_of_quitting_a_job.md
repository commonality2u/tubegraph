Quitting your job is a proactive way to leave an organization on your own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It signifies taking ownership of your career and acting as a "free agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This approach allows you to recognize your career trajectory and proactively make a move that will better yourself, especially if you've been with a company for a long time and the market has passed you by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Advantages of Quitting

*   **On Your Own Terms**
    Quitting allows you to pick and choose when to exit the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. You likely already have a job lined up and are fully prepared for the transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This proactive approach is a significant advantage, particularly when compared to [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_being_laid_off | being laid off]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Career Advancement & Compensation**
    By testing the open market, you are likely to see bigger pay increases than by staying with your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Job Search Advantage**
    It is generally easier to get another job when you are currently employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. There's less pressure, allowing you to relax, sell yourself more easily, and have greater negotiating power since you don't "need" the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Interview Narrative Control**
    When you quit, you have the initiative to [[discussing_reasons_for_leaving_current_job | spin the reason why you left]] in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Employers generally prefer candidates who quit for good reasons rather than those who left due to being upset or in a tough situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Potential for Rehire**
    If you follow the [[steps_to_quitting_a_job_properly | proper steps to quitting]], you may be eligible for rehire, which can be a valuable safety net if things don't work out with a new employer or during an economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Quitting

*   **Loss of Benefits & Income**
    When you voluntarily leave your job, you will not receive a severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Additionally, you are generally not eligible to collect unemployment benefits, unless it was due to a toxic work environment and it was your only option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**
    There's a risk that the "grass isn't actually greener" at the new employer, or that market conditions change and your previous job is already filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Rehire Ineligibility (if not done properly)**
    If you "burn bridges" when quitting, you may not be eligible for rehire at your former company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Missed Opportunities**
    If you quit just before a company announces a major layoff, you might miss out on a significant severance package you would have been eligible for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## When Quitting Might Not Be the Best Option

In specific scenarios, quitting might not be the most advantageous choice:

*   **Poor Performance Leading to Termination**
    If you have a track record of poor performance and are on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or being documented by HR, it might be better to let your employment be terminated (fired for performance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. In such cases, you could still collect unemployment benefits and possibly have a continuation of benefits, whereas quitting would make you ineligible for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. You wouldn't get a positive reference either way, and wouldn't be eligible for rehire by quitting in this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Anticipated Layoffs**
    If you anticipate a layoff in your industry or at your company, it may be beneficial to wait before quitting. Quitting just weeks before a mass layoff could mean missing out on a severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Overall, [[comparing_options_for_leaving_a_job | quitting your job]] is generally the most preferable option when you are ready to make a proactive career move and have a new opportunity lined up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

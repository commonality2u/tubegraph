The contemporary job market often leaves job seekers feeling that employer requirements are out of touch. This sentiment is supported by the existence of "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These undisclosed criteria, often reflecting [[employer_biases_against_hiring_older_workers|hiring manager biases]], can make the job search feel impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Origin of Hidden Requirements

Hidden job requirements stem from internal selection guidelines provided by hiring authorities, typically the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. When a job requisition is opened, the recruiter and hiring manager discuss "must-haves," "nice-to-haves," and "wish lists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Requirements (Must-Haves)**: These are usually obvious, such as total years of experience or degree requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Preferred (Wish List)**: This is where hiring manager bias often enters the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Recruiters are often blamed for these biases, but they typically originate from the hiring manager or their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. A competent recruiter should challenge unrealistic demands to avoid eliminating good candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, but this doesn't always happen, especially with less experienced recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Case Study: Accidental Internal Guidelines

An illustrative example surfaced when a recruiter accidentally emailed a technical candidate their secret internal selection guidelines for a software development role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These guidelines, referred to as an "internal client memo," were not part of the public job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Both internal company recruiters and third-party headhunters would receive these same directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The contents of this accidentally leaked memo reveal extreme [[absurd_job_requirements_and_red_flags|job requirements]] and biases:

### What They Are Looking For:
*   **Education**: University graduate with a Bachelor's or Master's in Computer Science from a "top program" like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, or University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. A special exception might be made for 4.0 graduates from other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Experience**: 4 to 10 years of software development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, with expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), Cotlin, AI, and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Job Stability**: Longevity in roles, requiring two or more years in each position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Job hoppers are not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, even if they lost a job due to layoffs or company closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Company Background**: Significant experience in notable startups backed by firms like Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Diversity**: [[discrimination_laws_in_hiring|Diversity hires]] (e.g., Black, female) are a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Citizenship**: Must be a US citizen, permanent resident (green card holder), or Canadian citizen; no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Bonus**: Being a founding engineer or having founder experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### What to Avoid:
*   **Visa Candidates**: Explicitly excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Career Contractors**: Candidates who have worked permanently for companies are preferred; contract work in one's background is a disqualifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Job Hoppers**: Frequent short stints are to be avoided, regardless of the reason for leaving a previous role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Coding Bootcamp Graduates**: Graduates from coding boot camps (e.g., Full Stack Academy, Hacked Reactor) are not considered capable of coding and are rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Consulting Backgrounds**: Experience limited to IT software development firms (consulting) instead of companies directly producing products is not accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Big Company Only Experience**: Experience limited to large companies like Uber or Intel is not considered unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Candidates with only big company experience are believed to "not understand how it is to code in a startup organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Fake Profiles**: Recruiters are instructed to screen candidates properly due to an increase in fake profiles, especially with AI-generated resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This highlights a concern within [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices|hiring practices]].

### Blacklisted Companies:
Candidates who have ever worked at specific companies are "scarlet-lettered" or blacklisted and will "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Examples include Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, and Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Impact and Reality

This case, while extreme, is not far from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Many companies have hidden requirements that dictate who they will or won't consider, often based on previous employers or specific career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. These unlisted criteria make the hiring manager's candidate pool much more difficult to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Such [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs|employer recruitment practices]] lead to unrealistic expectations and can contribute to [[predatory_hiring_practices|predatory hiring practices]].

## Advice for Job Seekers

When encountering such [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings|unrealistic employer demands]], job seekers should remember that the issue lies with the employer, not themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

*   **Optimize Your Application**: Present a clean, direct resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Targeted Networking**: Engage in targeted networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Showcase Work**: Create a GitHub, portfolio, or simple website to demonstrate your fit, if applicable to your job type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Move On**: Don't dwell on unrealistic hiring managers; it's often best to move on to the next opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Avoid Low-Quality Employers**: Do not apply for jobs from companies with such ridiculous wish lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. By not applying, job seekers can encourage these companies to adjust their unrealistic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

Ultimately, reclaiming control in one's career is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Not having a headshot means missing out on an opportunity to brand yourself effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

A good profile picture is a necessity to attract the right opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## AI-Generated Headshots as an Alternative

If you're not satisfied with your current [[ai_generated_linkedin_headshots | LinkedIn headshot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, or if you don't have one you like, [[ai_generated_linkedin_headshots | AI technology]] can be an option for creating a professional-looking image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This technology, which has gained viral attention, allows users to upload multiple selfies and receive convincing professional headshots generated by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### How AI Headshot Generation Works

One such application is called Remini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The process typically involves:
1.  Heading to the app and selecting the AI photo generation option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
2.  Uploading 8 to 12 personal photos or selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
3.  Selecting your gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
4.  Choosing a reference image or aesthetic for the AI to model the new photos after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
5.  Allowing the app a few minutes to render the new headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The results can be "pretty insane" and look like professional headshots, often placing the subject in different locations or outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Considerations for Using AI Headshots

While [[ai_generated_linkedin_headshots | AI technology]] can produce convincing headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, a concern is the potential for "catfishing," where the generated photo doesn't accurately represent the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is recommended to use source photos that accurately reflect your current appearance to ensure the AI-generated headshot provides a clean and professional look without misrepresenting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

This technology can be a cost-effective alternative to professional headshots for those looking to [[effectiveness_of_linkedin_for_career_growth | upgrade their LinkedIn profile]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Beyond the Headshot

The ultimate goal of enhancing your [[importance_of_linkedin_profile_for_job_seekers | LinkedIn profile]], including your headshot, is to gain more traction on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

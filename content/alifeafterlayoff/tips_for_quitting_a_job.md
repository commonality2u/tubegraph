When you [[steps_to_quitting_a_job_properly | quit your job]] and tender your resignation, Human Resources (HR) might ask you to sit down for an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explains what an exit interview is, why companies conduct them, and whether you should participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## What is an Exit Interview?
An exit interview is a meeting, typically in your last week of employment, where HR invites you to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. It's usually conducted by an HR representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Purpose of Exit Interviews
Companies conduct exit interviews primarily to collect data on overall trends within their workforce and in relation to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This data helps them identify potential issues and implement corrective actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
They look for:
*   **Employment Trends** If many employees are leaving due to uncompetitive compensation or benefit issues, the company can analyze these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Voluntary Turnover** While some employee turnover is considered "healthy," good organizations track voluntary turnover to determine if there's a larger underlying problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Manager Performance** HR might investigate a manager who consistently experiences higher-than-average employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This could lead to retraining or troubleshooting the manager's style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The motivation behind exit interviews is generally to collect data and is not as "sinister" as some may think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### How Exit Interviews are Conducted
An exit interview typically involves a Human Resources manager, or an entry-level HR employee, going through a standard form with basic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
Common questions include:
*   Why did you decide to leave? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Where are you going, and what kind of position are you taking? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   What feedback can you provide? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   How did you like your boss? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Would you consider returning to work here in the future? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

The collected information might be saved in your employment file or a generic HR file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Larger companies may even use third-party organizations to collect this data and generate reports for executive-level review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Should You Participate in an Exit Interview?
Generally, it is not recommended to participate in an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Reasons Not to Participate
1.  **They Are Not Required** Companies cannot force you to participate, withhold paychecks, or take any adverse action if you decline an exit interview. It is strictly voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
2.  **You Have Little to Gain and Potentially Much to Lose** As an employee, you gain almost nothing from participating, but there are potential downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   **The "Dark Side"** While seemingly innocent, the exit interview can inadvertently harm you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. If you vent frustrations about issues like a bad boss, lack of promotion opportunities, or a toxic work environment, these gripes will be documented and associated with your employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   **Burning Bridges** Spewing pent-up frustration can burn a bridge with the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. It's always better not to burn a bridge, as you never know what the future holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If you decide to apply for a job with that employer again in the future, that negativity could make you unhirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    *   **Reference Checks** A common misconception is that a new employer will be able to reference your exit interview details during a background or reference check. This is generally not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Companies typically face legal trouble if they provide a new employer with detailed reasons for your departure, as it could lead to liability and lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### When Participation Might Be Considered
If you are 100% certain you will never return to that employer and you want to truly "tell them how it is," then feel free to participate and express your full thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This might be your only opportunity to voice your opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

However, consider your audience: you're typically speaking to an HR representative who likely isn't a major decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Your hope is that the information reaches those who can make a change, but it may often "fall on deaf ears" and only make you feel better temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Ultimately, if you're leaving due to valid issues with the department or management, your employer should already be aware of these problems through regular one-on-one discussions. If your departure comes as a surprise to your boss, it reflects poorly on their awareness of their department's issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

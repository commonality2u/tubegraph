[[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | Layoffs]] often occur due to evolving departmental needs and changes in an organization's strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This is a common factor, especially observed in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## How Departmental Shifts Lead to Layoffs

When a department alters its focus, it may deemphasize certain products or groups, rendering some positions unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This means [[Impact of layoffs on employees | layoffs]] in such cases are not related to an individual's [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] but rather to the overall strategic direction of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Employee Impact Despite Performance

Employees can be caught in these [[Corporate layoffs and employee treatment | layoffs]] even if they are top performers or have recently been promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. It's not uncommon for individuals to join a company or be promoted into a new division, only for the leadership team to change its strategic direction, leading to the deemphasis of their project and subsequent job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This outcome is through no fault of the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Mitigating Risk

While unpredictable, there are ways to reduce the risk of being affected by such [[Handling of layoffs by companies | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:
*   **Avoid Experimental Projects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>: Consider refraining from joining organizations focused on experimental or "Skunk Works" projects, especially during times of economic uncertainty, as these are often the first to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Business Areas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>: Avoid working on projects, teams, or divisions that are not central to the company's core business or are not generating significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. These areas are indicators that might be targeted for downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

These considerations tie into broader [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | cost-cutting measures]], where experimental or unprofitable divisions are often targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. They might be spun off, or their projects might be eliminated or deemphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

This type of [[Organizational and morale impacts of layoffs | layoff]] differs from those based on [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]], [[seniority_and_impact_on_layoffs | seniority]], or [[role_redundancy_and_obsolete_skills_leading_to_layoffs | obsolete skills]], as it stems purely from top-down strategic decisions.

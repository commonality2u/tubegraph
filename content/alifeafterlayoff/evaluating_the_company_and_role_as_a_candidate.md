During a job interview, candidates should actively evaluate the company and the specific role, rather than viewing the process as a one-way street where only they are being screened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This proactive approach, sometimes described as a "slightly more aggressive mindset," allows job seekers to gather critical information and make an informed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Asking pertinent questions not only demonstrates engagement to the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> but also helps the candidate [[evaluating_employer_quality_and_salary_offers | screen the potential employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Being selective about job offers is crucial, as a poor job choice can significantly hinder career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Recruiters often note a lack of engagement when candidates fail to ask questions, which is generally viewed negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The best candidates often make the interviewer feel as though *they* are being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Questions can be asked throughout the interview, not just at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Key Questions for Evaluation

To effectively [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | evaluate the company]] and role, consider asking the following questions:

### 1. Why is this position open? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
Understanding the reason for the vacancy provides insight into the department's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

*   If the previous person was terminated, laid off, or quit, it indicates potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   If they quit, inquire about their reasons for leaving, ensuring your work preferences align with the role's demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   If they were terminated, ask about their areas of unsuccessful performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   If it's an added headcount, this typically signals departmental or company growth, which is a positive indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 2. What is your vision for this role? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
This question helps understand the hiring manager's long-term aspirations for the position and its underlying purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Asking this early can enable you to [[how_to_articulate_your_interest_and_fit_for_the_job_role | tailor your interview responses]] to align with their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### 3. What is one weakness in your department, and what are its strengths? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
Flipping the common "what's your biggest weakness" question back to the interviewer helps gauge where your skills might fit in and if they align with the department's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

#### Contributing to Weaknesses/Strengths
Following up, ask: "How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> This allows you to determine if your contributions would be a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### 4. How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
It's crucial to understand if the expectations are reasonable and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If the hiring manager's expectations seem unrealistic, it's an opportunity to discuss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Unreasonable expectations can lead to failure and quick turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, impacting [[assessing_company_culture_during_interviews | cultural fit]].

### 5. What made a previous person so successful in this role? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
If the role had a successful predecessor who was promoted, asking about their key attributes provides a roadmap for your own success if you secure the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### 6. Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
While not inquiring about immediate promotional opportunities, it is reasonable to ask about long-term career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This helps [[assessing_company_vision_and_growth_opportunities | ensure the role isn't a dead end]] but remember to show genuine interest in the role you're currently interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 7. How would you describe your leadership style? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
It is important to [[analyzing_leadership_styles_in_potential_employers | vet your potential boss]] to ensure alignment with their leadership style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. An alternative phrasing: "If I were to ask your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> This question helps assess the manager's self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> and whether their style would be a good fit for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### 8. What is the organization's strategic direction? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>
You want to join an organization with clear strategic direction that you believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This question helps determine the company's longevity and stability, particularly to avoid moving from a stable position to one on "shaky ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, which can impact [[impact_of_company_financial_health_on_job_decisions | job decisions]].

*   **Research Competitors**: [[importance_of_researching_the_company_before_an_interview | Research competitors]] and any industry-shaking new technologies or processes they've introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Challenge on Strategy**: Ask, "I noticed that one of your competitors came out with a really intriguing new product/process/idea. How is this company planning to address that and stay in front of the market?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> A respectable company should be aware of competitors and have a strategic response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A lack of awareness is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### 9. If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
This "fun" question encourages strategic thinking from the hiring manager and provides valuable insight into their true concerns and what's happening behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

By asking these questions, you are not only satisfying the interviewer's expectation for curiosity but also critically screening the opportunity to ensure it aligns with your career goals and values.

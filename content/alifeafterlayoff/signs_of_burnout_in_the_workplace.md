Burnout in the workplace can manifest in several ways, often indicating it's time to consider a job change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These signs are common reasons why individuals seek new employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Key Signs of Burnout

### Constant Overload and Overwork
One of the most frequent indicators of burnout is feeling constantly overloaded or overworked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This phenomenon has become more prevalent due to factors like:
*   **Talent Exodus** Many people have exited the workforce, and companies struggle to replace this talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Cost-Cutting** Companies may cut expenses due to inflation and rising operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Increased Workload** Often, the work previously handled by two individuals is squeezed into one person's responsibilities, leading to demands for 70 to 90 hours of work per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Such conditions are unsustainable and are a "surefire way" for an employee to get [[employee_burnout_and_digital_overload | burned out]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, prompting them to update their resume and seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Lack of Vacation and Decompression
If your company is working you "to the bone" and you haven't been able to take vacations and decompress, it's a significant reason to explore other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Good companies understand the importance of not burning out their employees and invest in their well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If [[employee_burnout_and_digital_overload | burnout]] is an issue, it's advisable to update your resume and begin a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Sense of Dread and Lack of Engagement
A strong sense of dread when Monday morning arrives, or experiencing the "Sunday scaries," is a clear indicator that something is amiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This suggests you are not fully engaged or passionate about your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. If you find yourself having to "psych yourself up" just to go into the office or log on, it could mean you are in the wrong job type, the wrong company, or simply experiencing [[employee_burnout_and_digital_overload | burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Quiet Quitting
[[Signs of quiet firing in the workplace | Quiet quitting]], characterized by doing less and less work due to burnout, lack of motivation, or a loss of passion for the job, is another sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. If you struggle to find motivation or are producing less, it's an indicator that a change is likely needed for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Suffering Health
If your health is suffering as a direct result of your job, it's a serious sign to seek other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This can manifest as:
*   Increased stress and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Sudden weight gain or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   Changes in temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   Shifts in sleep cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   Needing medication because of your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

There is "no positive outcome" to enduring a job that negatively impacts your health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

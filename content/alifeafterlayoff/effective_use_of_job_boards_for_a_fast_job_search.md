When aiming to speed up your [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search]] and get back into the workforce quickly, the effective use of job boards is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach focuses on efficiency and targeting to maximize your efforts.

## Focus on Key Job Boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:03">[02:57:03]</a>

To enhance your job search efficiency, narrow your focus to a few well-known and relevant job boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:03">[02:59:03]</a>. Recommended platforms include:
*   Indeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:03">[03:04:03]</a>
*   LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:03">[03:04:03]</a>
*   Google job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:03">[03:05:03]</a>

### Avoid Obscure Niche Sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:03">[03:23:03]</a>

Employers often post job advertisements on their corporate career pages, which then propagate to numerous different sites, including obscure ones you may never have heard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:03">[03:07:03]</a>. Spending time on these very niche, unheard-of sites is largely a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:03">[03:23:03]</a>. It's unlikely that a job will only be posted on one such niche site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:03">[03:31:03]</a>, as employers typically contract with larger propagation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:03">[03:37:03]</a>. By concentrating on the major boards, you're guaranteed to find all the available jobs without getting bogged down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:03">[03:48:03]</a>.

## Utilize Job Alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:03">[06:56:03]</a>

Setting up alerts on job boards and company Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) is a major time-saver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:03">[06:56:03]</a>. This [[using_tools_and_templates_to_enhance_job_search_efficiency | efficiency tip]] prevents you from needing to manually check job boards daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:03">[06:58:03]</a>.

You can set up alerts for:
*   Specific keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:03">[07:20:03]</a>
*   Job types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:03">[07:21:03]</a>
*   Companies you're interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:03">[07:27:03]</a>

By receiving email notifications when new postings match your criteria, you can be an early applicant, which is always preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:03">[07:33:03]</a>. Applying early increases your chances, as employers may identify a candidate before the application process closes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:03">[07:38:03]</a>.

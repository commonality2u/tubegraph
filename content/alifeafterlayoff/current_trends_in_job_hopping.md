The practice of [[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | job hopping]], defined as moving from job to job at a similar career level in a relatively short amount of time, appears to be declining in viability as a primary career advancement strategy, according to recent economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Defining Job Hopping
[[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | Job hopping]] involves frequently changing jobs within a short timeframe, typically without a definitive career progression, meaning individuals are often "jumping from job A to job B to job C all at the same level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While the specific timeframe is subjective and varies by company, employers tend to view it as an indicator of an employee's short tenure, although this perspective is seen as ironic given companies' willingness to lay off staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Historically, [[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | job hopping]] has been a successful strategy for employees, particularly early in their careers, to rapidly move through salary bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, there's a point of diminishing returns, where salary growth slows significantly after moving past entry-level positions, making it harder to defend a sporadic work history on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Recent Trends in Job Hopping and Wage Growth
The strategy of [[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | job hopping]] gained significant popularity among new entrants to the workforce between 2020 and 2022, especially during the peak of the [[state_of_the_current_job_market | job market]] for job seekers around 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. After massive [[current_trends_and_causes_of_layoffs | layoffs]] in 2020, the [[state_of_the_current_job_market | job market]] rebounded strongly, particularly in the tech sector, leading to high demand and "bidding wars" for roles like software developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This environment allowed early-career professionals to gain significant salary increases by changing jobs frequently, with common raises of 10% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This era also saw the "Great Resignation," where people felt confident leaving careers for better opportunities and pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

However, the [[state_of_the_current_job_market | job market]] shifted in 2023, continuing into 2024, making it significantly harder to find well-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, reported by the Wall Street Journal, shows a clear trend in [[wage_growth_trends_for_job_switchers_vs_stayers | wage growth for job switchers versus those who stay]] in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Wage Growth for Job Switchers vs. Stayers (2022-2025)
*   **January 2022:** Job switchers saw a 4.7% increase, compared to 3.7% for stayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **October/November 2022 (Peak):** This period marked the peak of the [[state_of_the_current_job_market | job market]] for those seeking to switch roles, with job switchers averaging a 7.7% increase, while stayers received over 2% less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Even at this peak, high inflation meant job switchers were still falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **May 2023 Onwards:** The [[wage_growth_trends_for_job_switchers_vs_stayers | wage market]] began to "break" around May 2023, with a drastic decrease in wages employers were willing to pay for job switchers and even for retaining staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This shift led to increased [[current_trends_and_causes_of_layoffs | layoffs]] and restructuring as companies aimed to "reset" the market and bring wages down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **January 2025 (Projected/Current):** The incentive to leave jobs is largely gone, with job switchers seeing an average 4.8% increase versus 4.6% for those who stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This reflects the law of supply and demand, where a greater supply of job applicants allows companies to be more selective and offer lower pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Employer Strategy Shift
Companies are now focusing on retaining desired staff, becoming more efficient (potentially through AI), and "right-sizing" their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Alternatives to Job Hopping for Career Advancement
While strategic [[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | job hops]] may still offer some upward mobility, especially in terms of level rather than just salary, it is no longer as lucrative as it was a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Instead, alternative [[strategies_for_career_advancement_without_job_hopping | strategies for career advancement]] include:
*   Establishing a long-term career strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>
*   Taking calculated career steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Building in-demand skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>
*   Effectively marketing oneself through resumes, interviews, and networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
*   Establishing a clear personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>

These methods aim to propel a career forward with more authority, rather than relying on incremental steps or staying at the same level through a series of hops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

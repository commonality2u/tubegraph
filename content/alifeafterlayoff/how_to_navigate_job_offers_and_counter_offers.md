It is generally advised to think twice about accepting a [[understanding_counteroffers_from_employers | counteroffer]] from your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. As a career coach, the best interest of the individual is prioritized, and many circumstances show that accepting a [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | counteroffer]] does not work out well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Case Study: A Real-Life Scenario
A Reddit post provided a real-life example of a person navigating a job offer and a subsequent counteroffer from their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### The New Opportunity
The individual accepted an offer from a non-competing company for similar work, but with an expanded scope, and a 30% pay bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This indicates that the person was likely underpaid in their previous role or had stayed in it too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. A higher pay and expanded responsibilities leading to more experience are positive indicators for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The individual's gut instinct to accept the new offer was a strong indicator of it being the right decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### The Counteroffer from the Current Employer
Upon tendering resignation, the current employer, including leadership two layers up, suddenly surfaced "big plans" for the employee, such as hiring four to five new people to work under them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is a common tactic, referred to as the "proverbial carrot," used to keep employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The employee recognized that "talk is cheap," especially with a company where plans materialize slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

The COO eventually came to the employee with a counteroffer, proposing they join the IT team as a data engineer, even though it wasn't a pre-existing role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The COO agreed to exceed the new offer's salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### Maintaining Control and Confidentiality
When faced with a counteroffer, you are in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Listen, Don't Disclose**: Hear out what your current employer has to say and what they offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Keep Details Confidential**: Do not disclose specifics about the new opportunity, including the company, pay, or even job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This is to prevent the current employer from potentially interfering with your new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Request Documentation**: If considering a counteroffer, demand all proposed changes (job title, responsibilities, pay grade, salary) be documented in an official offer letter from the Human Resources department, not just your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Declining the Counteroffer
The most effective response is to honor your commitment to the accepted offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Be Polite but Firm**: You can inform the new employer's recruiter that you will not be moving forward due to a counteroffer, though they may be upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Yourself**: You are a "free agent" in the job market and must do what is best for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Don't Share Negative Feedback**: Avoid stating reasons like not doing your best work, feeling distracted, or not being challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Why Counteroffers Are Often a Bad Idea
Many [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | drawbacks]] exist when accepting a [[understanding_counteroffers_from_employers | counteroffer]]:

### Employer's Intentions and Behavior
*   **Underestimation/Taken for Granted**: A company offering a significant pay bump only when you're leaving indicates they likely undervalued or took you for granted previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Buying Time**: Employers often issue counteroffers to buy time to find your replacement, after which you might be targeted for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Sincerity**: Sudden "big plans" or new roles appearing only after resignation are often insincere attempts to retain you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Self-Serving Perspective**: The counteroffer is typically framed from the company's "we can use you" perspective, not "we would like to help you grow your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### [[Effects of accepting a counteroffer on career prospects | Career Prospects and Risks]]
*   **"More Expensive Version of You"**: Accepting a counteroffer without a new title or significant level increase means you become a higher-cost employee for the same role, making you a potential target for future layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Flight Risk Label**: Once you've shown willingness to leave, your employer may view you as a "flight risk," leading to a "target on your back" and higher performance expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Slow Career Advancement**: If a company's "wheel turns slowly" for promotions, even promises of leadership may take years to materialize, often requiring someone else to retire or be forced out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. True leadership aspirations at senior levels usually involve formal succession planning and development programs, which would already be in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Unreliable Past Performance**: Your company's past performance in treating employees is the best indicator of future behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. If they haven't valued you previously, they likely won't in the future.

## When to Consider a Counteroffer ([[recognizing_when_to_consider_a_counter_offer | Recognizing when to consider a counter offer]])
While generally discouraged, there might be rare circumstances where a counteroffer is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Significant Advancement**: Only consider if it unlocks an entirely new vertical with a new job title and level, along with new responsibilities, and a documented offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut**: Use your intuition and judgment to assess the specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Additional Considerations
*   **Keep Options Open**: Do not burn bridges; it's wise to stay in touch with your former employer, especially if they discuss future leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. You can propose returning if the promised leadership position materializes, expecting seniority to be honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Workplace Headaches Are Normal**: Every company has issues, and the "grass isn't always greener." The new role you're taking may have been vacated by someone equally frustrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Focus on whether the new opportunity aligns with your strategic career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_the_recruiter_in_job_offer_negotiations | Role of the Recruiter]]**: If an external recruiter contacted you, it indicates an external opportunity pulled you, rather than an internal issue pushing you away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Ultimately, the Reddit poster decided not to accept the counteroffer, recognizing the red flags and the insincerity of the current company's sudden plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

When considering a job transition, it's essential to understand the correct and proper way to resign from your current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Drawing on over 20 years of experience as a corporate recruiter and HR professional, the goal is to leave with grace and dignity, regardless of the reason for your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Why Leave Gracefully?

Leaving a job in an unprofessional manner, such as storming out or being aggressive, can have severe negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This approach can lead to:
*   Being ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Burning bridges with your current employer and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Damaging your professional reputation, potentially leading former colleagues to view you as a "loose cannon" and deterring future referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
It is always recommended to take the high road and remain professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Timing Your Departure Announcement

If you are unsatisfied with your job, your boss, or a [[toxic_work_environment | bad situation]], do not tell anyone you are looking to leave until you are absolutely ready to move on and have secured another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Informing your boss too early could result in a quicker departure than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It's generally easier to find a new job when you are already employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Pre-Notice Checklist
Before giving your two weeks' notice, ensure all your "ducks are in a row" with the new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This includes:
*   Completion of drug screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   Successful background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   Reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Confirmation of your start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

It can take several weeks for these pre-employment checks to clear, especially if you have lived in multiple locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Prematurely giving notice can lead to awkward situations if an offer is rescinded due to background check issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Keeping it Confidential
Resist the temptation to share the news with work friends, even close ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Rumors can spread, and if something goes wrong with the new offer, it can put you in a difficult spot with your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Maintain discretion until you have a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Delivering Your Notice

### Meeting with Your Boss
Once you have a confirmed start date, schedule a meeting with your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This should be face-to-face or via a video call (e.g., Zoom), not through email or text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

Keep your message concise and professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:
*   State that you've received another opportunity that is the best move for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   Thank them for the opportunity and time spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Clearly state you are giving your two weeks' notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Avoid elaborating on negative reasons for leaving, such as a bad boss or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This can escalate emotions and create conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   Your decision should be final; do not entertain [[counter_offers | counter offers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Informing Others
Always let your boss know first, not through office gossip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. After informing your boss, ask them when it is appropriate to notify your team members, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Following proper protocol leaves a good impression and prevents surprises or animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Managing the Transition

Recognize that your departure will create a void, increasing workloads for your colleagues and potentially impacting clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Be considerate and gracious with those who will be picking up your responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Work with your boss to create a smooth transition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Networking

Contact individuals who were instrumental in your [[career_advice_for_transitioning_to_new_job_opportunities | career]] (e.g., mentors, trainers, those who gave you opportunities) and give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Ask them to join your personal network, especially on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Building and maintaining professional networks is crucial for future [[strategies_for_successful_job_searching_and_interviewing | job opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Giving Two Weeks' Notice

While not legally required, providing two weeks' notice is a professional courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. It allows you to tie up loose ends and, more importantly, it helps your colleagues transition your work, preventing them from being left in a difficult situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Last Day Conduct

On your final day, gather your immediate group (if local) or connect individually with influential colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Briefly explain that you have a new, better opportunity that suits your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Focus on positive aspects, such as enjoying working with the team and appreciating the opportunity for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Do not trash the company, your job, or your boss, as this burns bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Consider asking your current boss if there's an opportunity to return to the organization if things don't work out at your new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Always try to leave on good terms with former bosses, as they can be crucial references and potential future connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Maintaining Your Employment Brand

How you treat people when you leave an organization reflects on your "employment brand" and will follow you throughout your [[career_advice_for_transitioning_to_new_job_opportunities | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Leaving on good terms and making a great impression is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

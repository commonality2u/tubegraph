While it is generally advised not to quit a job before securing a new one, certain circumstances are "deal breakers" that necessitate immediate departure from a current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As a corporate recruiter and HR professional with 20 years of experience, the speaker has observed numerous situations where individuals needed to leave their employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Many people face similar difficult decisions about their work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Tolerating a job you dislike can be emotionally and physically draining, impacting not only you but also your loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A steady job is not a justification for enduring a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Although perseverance in the face of adversity is valued by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, there's a distinction between "job hopping" and leaving a genuinely bad situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It is not necessary to stay in a role that does not align with your core values or causes you physical or mental harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Five Deal Breaker Situations

There are five key situations that warrant quitting your job and seeking new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>:

### 1. Suffering Emotionally or Physically

Working in a role that adversely affects your mental and physical health is a clear indicator that you need to leave quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Being overworked, overwhelmed, or out of your depth can lead to significant health problems, impacting both you and those close to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. If your job necessitates seeing a doctor due to stress, it's a major red flag, as no position should cause such distress (unless you are a brain surgeon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Symptoms of job-related stress can include:
*   Loss of appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Sudden weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
*   Loss of sleep or sleepless nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   Loss of interest in previously enjoyed hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Anxiety or anxiousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Waking up at night worrying about work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   Physical manifestations like hair loss or hives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   Complete lack of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Dreading going to work on Monday mornings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

Your health is paramount, and staying in an unhealthy role will negatively impact your time, money, career path, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If the stress stems from the career itself rather than just the company, it may be time to consider a different field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### 2. Having a Terrible Boss

A common reason people leave jobs is dissatisfaction with a bad boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A previously high-performing individual can feel like a failure under a new boss, leading to self-doubt and negative impacts on their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Examples of poor leadership include:
*   Cutting earned bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>
*   Throwing employees "under the bus" in public settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
*   Lacking emotional intelligence and demonstrating poor leadership traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
*   Reprimanding employees in front of peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Giving feedback that crushes morale instead of improving performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>
*   Dismissing ideas or demotivating through criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>

If you find yourself in any of these situations, it's time to consider leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### 3. Experiencing a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | Toxic Work Culture]]

A "win at all costs" mentality, often originating from the top, is a sign of a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work culture]] and contributes to high employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While competitiveness is healthy, winning at the expense of employees or ethical practices is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Indicators of a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work culture]] include:
*   Company core values not being reflected by the leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
*   Lack of respect in meetings or between colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
*   Unrealistic or unattainable goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
*   Lack of recognition for accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   Toxic colleagues who make your life miserable, spread rumors, or undermine you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>

If your manager is oblivious to or even aligned with such toxic individuals, it's advisable to look elsewhere, as you are unlikely to "win" in that environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 4. The Company is Doing Something Illegal

If your employer is breaking the law or asking you to do so, you must leave immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This indicates a complete lack of moral compass within the organization, and you could be held personally liable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This applies to financial misconduct, questionable environmental policies, or breaches of human resources laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

If you witness illegal activities, first report it to your HR or legal department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. If no action is taken and the behavior persists, it's time to resign, as no job is worth jeopardizing your professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### 5. Being Asked to Do Something Unsafe

Despite OSHA rules and safety protocols, some companies skirt safety guidelines, usually to expedite work and maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Safety is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. If your company asks you to do something unsafe or less than safe, it demonstrates a lack of commitment to your well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Trust your intuition; if something feels wrong, voice your concerns to your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. If your boss is unresponsive, escalate to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Any decent leader would halt work and address safety concerns immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. If the company prioritizes profit over your life or well-being, it's absolutely worth quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. No job is worth risking your life or limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Distinguishing Between a Deal Breaker and a Challenge

It's crucial to differentiate between a deal-breaker situation and a manageable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. If you're simply bored or underutilized, consider taking initiative by volunteering for a process improvement project or developing new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Companies value candidates who can persevere through adversity and find creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

However, do not tolerate a position that falls into the deal-breaker scenarios for the sake of maintaining a steady job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Ultimately, your career is your responsibility, and you must take the necessary steps to achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

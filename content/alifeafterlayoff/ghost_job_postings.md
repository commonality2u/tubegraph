## What are Ghost Job Postings?
Ghost job postings are job listings that an employer has no real intention of ever filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>. This phenomenon, also known as "ghost postings," refers to [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience|fake job postings]] that appear on the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Current Job Market Context
The current job market presents conflicting data, with the FED reporting a robust market with record job openings, while major corporations simultaneously announce layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. This situation makes it seem as though something "doesn't seem to be adding up," as there are record numbers of jobs alongside significant layoffs, and positions that never get filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. The speaker's opinion is that while people are still landing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>, the "employment pendulum has swung back to the employer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>, leading to behaviors like forcing people back into the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a> and an increase in ghost postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

> [!INFO] Misleading Job Numbers
> The total number of job openings is often misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:06">[03:26:06]</a>. Many of the reported "record number of jobs" are contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that likely don't offer benefits and are not considered "career type jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>. This discrepancy can be frustrating for job seekers who are told the market is robust but aren't seeing it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>.

## Pipelining Requisitions
A "pipelining wreck" (requisition) is a job posted by an employer with the primary goal of collecting resumes for a future date, without the immediate intention of filling the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This strategy aims to give employers a "head start" when they do decide to recruit again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>. The speaker has personally observed such postings, even for companies that recently had massive layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>. Leaders in the speaker's own career have suggested posting these, though the speaker finds them to be a very poor [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience|candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.

### Impact on Candidate Experience
Pipelining requisitions create a poor [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience|candidate experience]] because job seekers, especially those who have been laid off, are not interested in being misled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. Candidates invest time in preparing targeted, custom resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, expecting genuine consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:09">[02:38:09]</a>. Employers and talent acquisition leaders often "lose sight of the candidate experience" and fail to put themselves in the job seeker's shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. This can lead to anxious waiting for responses that never come, which is "just not a good look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>.

## Survey Insights on Ghost Jobs

A survey conducted by Clarify Capital (August 31st - September 1st, 2022) questioned 1,045 managers involved in hiring about ghost jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>:
*   **68%** of managers had job postings active for more than 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:05">[04:35:05]</a>. (Note: Many highly skilled positions typically stay open longer than 30 days, sometimes 45-60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>.)
*   **1 in 10** hiring managers had a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:03">[05:00:03]</a>. (These are considered "aging wrecks" that often require extra resources or indicate [[challenges_with_unrealistic_job_postings|picky hiring managers]] or a lack of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.)
*   **1 in 5** managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:05">[05:29:05]</a>.
*   **50%** of managers keep job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:09">[05:42:09]</a>.

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs
The most common reasons why employers maintain ghost job postings, even when not actively trying to fill a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>:

1.  **Company is always open to new people (50%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:07">[06:57:07]</a>: Employers simply want to keep requisitions open to see who applies, like "window shopping" without an immediate intention to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:06">[07:00:06]</a>.
2.  **To keep current employees motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:05">[07:32:05]</a>: This reason is seen as puzzling and possibly deceitful, as [[reasons_for_employment_ghosting|tricking employees]] about open jobs won't keep them motivated long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
3.  **To give the impression that the company is growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:07">[08:01:07]</a>: This practice is considered very shady and potentially illegal, as it deceives both job candidates and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:05">[08:06:05]</a>. A company engaging in such behavior is generally not one you want to work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:08">[08:50:08]</a>.
4.  **The job was filled** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:07">[08:56:07]</a>: This indicates laziness from the recruiter or HR person, as the job should be pulled down once filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:04">[08:58:04]</a>.
5.  **To have an active pool of candidates/applicants in case of turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:09">[09:18:09]</a>: Companies are strategically keeping candidate pools ready, mirroring the advice that individuals should always keep their resumes updated and be open to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:09">[09:23:09]</a>.
6.  **In case an "irresistible candidate" applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:07">[09:42:07]</a>: This is characterized as "lazy recruiting" and "irresponsible" because it implies a lack of active effort in finding candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
7.  **To placate overworked employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:09">[10:04:09]</a>: This is described as particularly sinister, as it involves misleading overloaded employees by suggesting help is coming when it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
8.  **Forgot to delete the job** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:09">[10:37:09]</a>: Another instance of "lazy recruiter or lazy HR person" with no excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:09">[10:41:09]</a>.
9.  **No reason in particular/They simply don't care** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:09">[10:46:09]</a>.

## How to Identify and Avoid Ghost Job Postings
To avoid falling victim to ghost job postings and target only high-quality roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:05">[10:53:05]</a>:

*   **Check the posting date:** If a job has been up for over six months, it's likely a ghost wreck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:03">[11:02:03]</a>. Repeated postings of the same job over a long period also indicate a ghost wreck, a indecisive hiring manager, or high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. These are indicators of a [[how_to_identify_low_quality_job_postings|low quality employer]] or requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Perform [[confidential_job_postings|reverse reference checks]]**: Research whether the company recently had major layoffs, especially in the same types of positions now being posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. If so, they might be building a pipeline for future hires, indicating disloyalty to those roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
*   **Scrutinize the job description**: A detailed job description with specifics about responsibilities, accomplishments, and support structure indicates a more serious requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:03">[12:01:03]</a>. Pipelining requisitions often have generic, "salesy" descriptions without specific role details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. A generic job description is a "pretty big red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:08">[12:29:08]</a>.
*   **Consider the recency of the post**: A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an actively recruited position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. If it's more recent, it's more likely to be a legitimate role they are looking to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

Employees often look for new opportunities when they are [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | unhappy at work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Several factors contribute to this [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | dissatisfaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, leading them to explore the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Common Reasons for Seeking New Employment

*   **Feeling Undervalued or Underpaid** Employees may feel [[signs_of_being_undervalued_by_your_employer | underappreciated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> or underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, or that their skill set is [[signs_of_being_undervalued_by_your_employer | undervalued]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. A key indicator of this is when an employer only offers a significant raise or promotion after an employee has already secured an outside job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Lack of Career Progression** Being passed up for a deserved promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> can be a significant demotivator. Some employees might be so effective in their current role that their boss is reluctant to promote them, effectively "locking" them into their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Excessive Workload and Poor Work-Life Balance** Feeling completely overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> and struggling with work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> can lead to [[career_dissatisfaction_and_job_burnout | burnout]] and a desire for change.
*   **Dysfunctional Management and Culture**
    *   **Bad Boss** Employees often seek new roles due to a bad boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   **Poor Company Culture** An unhealthy or [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> also contributes to [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | dissatisfaction]].
*   **Poor Benefits or Commute** Issues such as terrible benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> or a difficult commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> can also drive employees to seek alternatives.
*   **Industry and Business Instability** Concerns about being in a dying industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> or worries about the overall business stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> of the current company can prompt employees to look for more secure opportunities.

## Impact of Employer Complacency

Employers who offer a counteroffer only when an employee is about to leave often demonstrate that they were previously taking the employee for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> or were complacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This reactive approach, rather than proactive recognition, can reinforce the employee's perception that they were [[signs_of_being_undervalued_by_your_employer | undervalued]] until they threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

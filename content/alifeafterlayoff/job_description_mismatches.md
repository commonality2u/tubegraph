A significant sign that a job offer should be declined is when the job description does not accurately reflect the actual work being described during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Identifying the Mismatch
Before an interview, candidates should carefully read the job description to understand the requirements and how their skills align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. If, during the interview, the job's responsibilities or expectations appear to have significantly shifted to something entirely different, this serves as a major [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | warning sign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Causes and Consequences
Such a mismatch can indicate that:
*   The company is not "calibrated" regarding what they genuinely seek in a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   The company is attempting to assign more responsibilities than is reasonable for one role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

This situation often leads to [[job_application_challenges_and_solutions | job dissatisfaction]] and burnout for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### "Bait and Switch" Tactic
Some companies engage in a "bait and switch" tactic, where they interview a candidate for one role but then place them into a different position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. They might promise a future move back to the originally discussed role, but this rarely materializes as promised, often resulting in a blended role the candidate didn't initially agree to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Recommended Action
If a "bait and switch" scenario or a significant job description mismatch occurs during the interview process, it is crucial to:
*   Address the discrepancy immediately with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   Ensure a clear understanding of the exact role and responsibilities before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   In most instances, it is recommended to decline the opportunity and walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

When interviewing for a new role, it's crucial for job seekers to [[evaluating_job_offers_and_company_culture | evaluate the company]] they are considering joining just as much as they are being evaluated [00:01:28]. This includes assessing the company's strategic direction and the leadership style of the hiring manager [00:06:35]. Asking insightful questions shows engagement and curiosity, which interviewers appreciate [00:00:51].

### Assessing Company Strategy

Understanding a company's strategic direction is a critical piece of information when considering an offer [00:06:37]. You do not want to join an organization that lacks clear strategic direction, or one whose direction you do not believe in, or worse, one that its own employees do not believe in [00:06:40]. It's essential to determine if there is longevity and stability in the position to avoid leaving a stable situation for one that is on shaky ground [00:06:48].

To assess company strategy:

*   **Research Competitors**: Before the interview, conduct homework to identify the company's biggest competitors [00:07:00].
*   **Inquire About Market Response**: If competitors have introduced industry-shaking new technology, products, processes, or ideas, challenge the interviewer on how the company plans to address these developments and stay ahead in the market [00:07:04]. A respectable company should be aware of competitors' actions and have a strategic direction in mind [00:07:19]. A lack of awareness or direction can be a red flag [00:07:26].
*   **Identify Core Concerns**: Ask the hiring manager: "If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> Listening closely to their answer can provide significant insight into the true behind-the-scenes dynamics [00:07:47].

### Assessing Leadership Style

Vetting your potential boss is essential to ensure alignment with their leadership style and to determine if it will be a long-term fit for your career [00:05:56].

To assess leadership style:

*   **Direct Question**: Ask the hiring manager directly: "What would you describe your leadership style as?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   **Indirect Question**: Alternatively, use a more indirect approach: "If I was to go out into your department and ask some of your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
    *   This question can reveal the manager's self-awareness [00:06:18]. While they likely won't admit to being a "bad boss," their perspective on their own leadership style is valuable [00:06:21]. It can provide an understanding of the type of boss you would be working for and whether that would be a good fit for you and your career [00:06:28].

Remember, questions can be asked throughout the interview process, not just at the end [00:07:57]. Engaging in a two-way dialogue makes the interview more effective [00:08:07].

Effective [[career management and planning | career management and planning]] involves understanding the job market and developing a strategic approach to career moves, particularly when faced with counter offers or new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

## Navigating Counter Offers

A common scenario in [[navigating_career_transitions_and_job_market_changes | navigating career transitions]] is receiving a counter offer from your current employer after accepting a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While it might feel good to be wanted, a career coach's perspective suggests caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

### Why Think Twice About Accepting a Counter Offer
Many circumstances show that accepting a counter offer often doesn't work out well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

Key reasons to be wary include:
*   **Being Underpaid or Taken for Granted**  
    If your current company offers a significant pay bump (e.g., 30%) only after you've tendered your resignation, it suggests you were likely underpaid or not fully valued previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. The question to ask is, "Why wasn't I recognized before?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:47">[09:20:47]</a>.
*   **The "Dangling Carrot" Trap**  
    Companies often promise big plans, promotions, or new team leadership roles only after you've expressed intent to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:21">[03:06:21]</a>. This is a common trap, where promises of future growth are just out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:42">[03:14:42]</a>. Talk is cheap, and plans, especially in slow-moving companies, come to fruition slowly, if at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:35">[03:27:35]</a>. Any such promises should be in writing, accompanied by a solid pay bump, a new job title, and a clear job description from HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:39">[03:32:39]</a>.
*   **Becoming a "Target" or "Flight Risk"**  
    Accepting a counter offer can make you the "most expensive person in the department," potentially marking you for future layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. The company may also view you as a flight risk, leading to a higher level of expectation and scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:14">[07:10:14]</a>.
*   **Lack of Genuine Career Development**  
    If a company genuinely has senior-level plans for you (VP, C-Suite), you should already be part of their succession planning program, receiving development, mentoring, and possibly even further education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:44">[12:07:44]</a>. If you're not, or if promotions typically only happen when someone retires or leaves, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:04">[17:10:04]</a>.
*   **Insincerity and Lack of Proactive Planning**  
    When senior leadership (VPs, COO, CEO) suddenly engages you after your resignation, it often indicates they were caught off guard and lacked a proactive plan for your retention or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:39">[03:53:39]</a>. Their focus tends to be on how "we can use you" rather than "how we can help you grow your [[career_management_and_planning | career]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

> "Your past performance is the best indicator of your future performance. The same thing can be said for your company or your boss. Their past performance is the best indicator of their future performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:33">[13:06:33]</a>.

### Managing the Conversation
When your current employer tries to counter:
*   **Maintain Control:** You are in the driver's seat with an acceptable offer already in hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:04">[04:22:04]</a>.
*   **Keep Details Vague:** Do not disclose details about the new opportunity, pay, or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>. Companies can sometimes "torpedo" new opportunities behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:39">[04:58:39]</a>.
*   **State Your Intentions Clearly:** Communicate that your decision is driven by an opportunity pulling you, not an issue pushing you away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:10">[05:20:10]</a>. Affirm your commitment to the accepted offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:23">[05:53:23]</a>.
*   **Don't Burn Bridges:** It's always advisable to maintain good relations, even if you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:49">[09:56:49]</a>. You can even suggest staying in touch for a potential future leadership role if the current company is truly ready to move forward with a concrete plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:07">[10:05:07]</a>.

## [[Impact of toxic work environments | Impact of Toxic Work Environments]]

Being in a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] can be one of the most physically and emotionally draining situations in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It can "suck the life out of you" and affect those around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Symptoms and effects include:
*   Anxiety-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Inability to sleep well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Dreading going to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Physical health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

If you suspect you are in such a situation, it's crucial to begin putting together an exit strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Signs of a Toxic Work Environment

### High Voluntary Turnover
High turnover rates are a clear sign that something is wrong in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. While some turnover is natural and healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, an abnormally high rate in the company or a specific department spells trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This refers to voluntary turnover, where employees choose to leave, not terminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. People typically don't leave great companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, as good companies work with employees to grow their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and have much lower turnover rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

If you observe a "revolving door" of employees, pay close attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This is a question to ask during interviews: "Why is the position open?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Research on platforms like Glassdoor for common threads in reviews regarding departures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Excessive Involuntary Turnover
This refers to situations where the company terminates or lets go of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A company with a reputation for terminating people for small infractions or for not hitting very difficult metrics is a huge red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Such companies often have knee-jerk reactions to market conditions, believing they can rehire staff later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This indicates an inept management team or one that doesn't care about its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Similarly, [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | bosses who fire on a whim]] due to unmet unreasonable standards also contribute to an unstable and toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Ever-Changing Targets
Moving targets are a clear sign of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. When goals constantly shift, you never truly know what you're aiming for, making it frustrating to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This lack of alignment can lead to internal competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. When a "carrot" is dangled just out of reach to keep you working harder, it's a sign to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Having your compensation tied to such insecurity is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Poor Company Reviews
Reviews on platforms like Glassdoor or Indeed offer insights into the work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While people tend to leave reviews when unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, look for common threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Consider reviewing aspects like:
*   Leadership team's adherence to core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
*   Realistic expectations for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Competitiveness of benefits and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>
*   Treatment of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>
*   Work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

Beware of suspicious clusters of positive reviews, as unscrupulous companies may incentivize employees to post false reviews to pad their stats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This act itself is a sign of a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### "Win at All Costs" Mentality
This mentality typically originates at the most senior levels of an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While competitiveness is acceptable, it's toxic if a company cuts corners, engages in shady or illegal activities, and treats employees poorly just to maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Such organizations prioritize money over everything else, which puts employees low in the hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If employer goals come at the expense of doing the right thing, be wary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Lack of Work-Life Balance
Companies or bosses who pride themselves on excessive working hours are toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Most jobs should be performable within 40 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Routinely working 60+ hours a week indicates understaffing, overworking, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. If your boss values "face time" over actual productive work, it's a [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | sign of a toxic boss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A good boss won't call you on nights, weekends, or vacation for non-urgent updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While occasional long hours for projects are normal, it shouldn't be a regular expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. People are increasingly demanding work-life balance as a critical factor for new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Dishonesty
If a company doesn't live by its core values, it's a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Dishonesty can manifest in leaders who don't practice what they preach or co-workers who fabricate situations to their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Being surrounded by dishonest people, especially those willing to "throw you under the bus," is not a winning formula and can derail a career instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Co-workers Going Behind Your Back
Conflict is inevitable, and most issues can be resolved through open communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, a co-worker who bypasses you and goes directly to your boss for every minor issue indicates a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This prevents building trust, leaving you constantly wondering who is spying or tattling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Issues with your work should be addressed directly with you first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Excessive Gossip
Gossip has always existed, but "excessive" or "toxic" gossip is a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. If you align yourself with workplace gossips, it can lead to a very short career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Getting labeled as a gossiper creates a stigma that is hard to shake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Gossip is a frequent cause of HR issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. To protect your upward mobility, stay clear of gossip circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Bad Bosses
Working for a [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | bad boss]] is one of the quickest ways to seek a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Often, people quit bosses, not jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. A great boss significantly improves work culture, while a bad one can negatively impact it rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Next Steps

If you identify with any of these [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | signs of a toxic work environment]], reflect on whether it's a systemic issue or localized to one person or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. If it's localized, a move to a different department might be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. However, if it's a company-wide problem that cannot be easily resolved, you must consider what is best for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. We are all free agents and need to prioritize ourselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. If you're in a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work environment]], take proactive steps to move your career forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

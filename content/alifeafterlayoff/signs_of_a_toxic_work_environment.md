Beginning a new job might lead to subtle signs that something is not quite right, making one wonder if they are in a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Being in a [[understanding_and_identifying_toxic_workplaces | toxic work environment]] can be one of the most physically and emotionally draining situations in a career, as it can "suck the life out of you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This negative impact can extend beyond work, following you home and potentially leading to anxiety-related issues, difficulty sleeping, and dreading the start of the work week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A [[impact_of_a_toxic_workplace_on_mental_and_physical_health | toxic workplace]] can also manifest physically through various health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and set back a career by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If a job makes you feel like a failure despite being effective, it's time to consider an exit strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[Recognizing a toxic work culture | Common Signs]]

Several indicators can help identify if you are in a [[recognizing_a_toxic_work_culture | toxic work environment]]:

### High Voluntary Turnover
High voluntary turnover rates are a clear sign that something is wrong in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While some turnover is natural and healthy, an abnormally high rate, especially within a specific department, suggests trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. People typically do not leave great companies unless they can no longer grow their careers within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The best companies usually have lower turnover rates than the standard 22% across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If there's a "revolving door" of employees, it's a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Researching company reviews on sites like Glassdoor can reveal common reasons for departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Excessive Involuntary Turnover
This refers to situations where employees are terminated, fired, or "let go" by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. An organization known for terminating people for minor infractions or for failing to meet extremely difficult metrics is a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Such companies often exhibit knee-jerk reactions to market conditions, believing they can easily rehire employees later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This indicates an inept management team or one that does not value its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Bosses who fire employees on a whim due to unreasonable standards also contribute to an unstable and [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Ever-Changing Targets
Constantly moving targets are another clear sign of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] because employees can never truly understand or achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This leads to frustrating employment experiences as nobody seems to be aligned, potentially causing individuals to work against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If goals are perpetually out of reach, designed to keep employees on a "hamster wheel," it indicates a harmful situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Having compensation tied to such insecurity is detrimental to one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Poor Reviews
Company reviews, often found on platforms like Glassdoor or Indeed, offer a good gauge of the work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While people tend to leave reviews when unhappy, looking for common threads in feedback can provide valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Key aspects to look for include leadership's adherence to core values, realistic expectations for employees, competitive benefits and compensation, treatment of staff, and work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Be wary of suspicious clusters of positive reviews, as some unscrupulous companies might incentivize false reviews to "pad their stats," which itself is a sign of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Win-at-All-Costs Mentality
A "win at all costs" mentality, often originating from senior leadership, rarely fosters a good work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. While competitiveness is healthy, engaging in corner-cutting, shady, or illegal practices, and treating employees poorly just for financial gain, are signs of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Such organizations prioritize profit above all else, leaving employees undervalued in the hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Lack of Work-Life Balance
Bosses and companies that pride themselves on demanding excessive hours are often toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Most jobs should be manageable within 40 hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Routinely working 60+ hours suggests understaffing, overworking, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. A boss who values "face time" over actual productive work, or who contacts employees during nights, weekends, or vacations for non-urgent matters, is a sign of a toxic manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. While occasional long hours might be necessary for projects, it shouldn't be a regular expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Prioritizing work-life balance is crucial, as lost personal time and memories cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Dishonesty
Dishonesty is one of the most obvious signs of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This includes leaders who don't practice what they preach, or dishonest co-workers who fabricate situations to their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Being surrounded by such individuals, especially those willing to "throw you under the bus" to save themselves, is not a winning formula and can instantly derail a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Co-workers Going Behind Your Back
While conflict is inevitable in a career, issues can typically be resolved through open communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, a co-worker who bypasses you and goes directly to your boss for every minor issue indicates a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This prevents the building of necessary trust, leaving you constantly wondering who is spying or tattling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Employees should be given the chance to address work-related issues directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Excessive Gossip
Gossip has always existed in workplaces, but excessive or "toxic gossip" is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Aligning with workplace gossips can lead to a very short career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Getting labeled as a gossiper can be a difficult stigma to remove, negatively impacting one's reputation and upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Gossip is frequently the root cause of HR issues, making it wise to avoid water cooler talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Bad Bosses
Working for a bad boss is one of the quickest ways to seek a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Often, people quit bosses, not jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. A great boss significantly improves the work culture, while a bad boss can quickly and negatively impact it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. If you find yourself with a bad boss, it's advisable to consider updating your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

If you find yourself in a [[understanding_and_identifying_toxic_workplaces | toxic work environment]], it's important to reflect whether the issues are systematic or localized to one person or boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. If it's a localized issue, a move to a different department might be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. However, if it's a company-wide problem that cannot be easily resolved, you must consider what is best for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. As "free agents," individuals should prioritize their own well-being and career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. If you are in a [[recognizing_a_toxic_work_culture | toxic work environment]], "hang in there but take proactive steps and make sure you're moving the ball forward in your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

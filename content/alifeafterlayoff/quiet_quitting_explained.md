[[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | Quiet quitting]] is a modern phenomenon in the workforce that has gained significant attention, often described as an extension of the [[great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is a legitimate concept discussed in publications like Business Insider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?
[[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | Quiet quitting]] is "effectively quitting your job without quitting your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It involves reducing one's output to the absolute minimum acceptable standard required for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This means doing "just enough to get by," not taking on additional tasks or burdens, performing the bare minimum, and alleviating work-related stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This approach is seen as a deliberate decision by employees who are tired of companies extracting "free labor" from them after years of feeling exploited through late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It can be viewed as a "secret resistance against the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Reasons for Quiet Quitting
Several factors contribute to individuals opting for [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet quitting]] rather than simply quitting their job:

*   **Re-evaluation of Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>: The pandemic prompted many to view work as simply a source of income to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding their utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Ideal Conditions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>:
    *   **Hot Labor Market**: A strong job market contributes to job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   **Remote Work**: The increase in remote work makes it more challenging for managers to monitor the effort employees put into their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Shift from "Hustle Culture" to "Coasting Culture"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>: For a long time, the employment market favored employers, leading to a "hustle culture" where employees felt compelled to work long, hard hours, take on extra tasks, and be constantly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This included sacrificing personal time, like taking calls during children's birthday parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This culture is now being replaced by a "coasting culture" where employees are dialing back their effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Feeling of Betrayal and Burnout** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>: Historically, companies would grow, become "bloated," and then undergo "ruthless cuts" through layoffs during catastrophic events like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The pandemic in 2020 served as another such event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. When companies made deep cuts and then demand for work "came screaming back," the remaining employees were "piled on" with additional work, leading to burnout and a sense of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Generational Shift** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>: The exit of Baby Boomers from the workforce and the entry of Gen Z, who have a different mentality about the workplace, contribute to this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Companies are now compelled to re-evaluate how they treat employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Loyalty to a single company for 20 years is considered "antiquated" and can lead to falling behind on compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## The Pendulum Swings
The employment market has seen a significant shift, with the pendulum moving away from being solely on the employer's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Employees are now establishing boundaries in their lives, which is seen as a healthy development, as employers previously "behaving badly got away with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Speaker's Stance and Alternative
The speaker clarifies that they are not advocating for [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet quitting]], slacking off, or being lazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Instead, they suggest that individuals unhappy with their job situation should "take a long hard look" at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The preferred approach is to keep one's resume updated and "strategically plan your exit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

However, for those with accrued benefits like vacation time or 401(k) investments who feel that [[pros_and_cons_of_quitting_a_job | quitting]] is not the best option, backing off to a "minimum acceptable output" can be a way to maintain employment, especially since employers struggle to backfill positions and prefer "some output is better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from the Article
The Business Insider article highlights two major points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>:
*   Employees now view jobs as a source of a paycheck, not a "higher calling that demands their utmost devotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This signals a shift from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   The notion that "my company's not my family" has led many Americans to shed expectations of grueling hours they once accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The decades of "leaning in" are now being replaced by "leaning back" to prevent "topping over" from burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

When preparing to leave a job, it is crucial to do so in a graceful and proper manner, regardless of the reasons for departure, such as a promotional opportunity, career advancement, or exiting a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience emphasizes that leaving a job professionally is key to preserving future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## The Wrong Way to Quit

Storming out, kicking a computer, or making dramatic declarations like "take this job and shove it" are considered the absolute wrong ways to quit a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Such actions will likely result in:
*   Ineligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   Burning all bridges with the employer and associated individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   Negative perceptions from even close work friends, who might view you as a "loose cannon" and be hesitant to refer you to future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   A fleeting sense of satisfaction that only lasts about a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

It is always better to leave on your own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Professionalism During the Transition

### Secrecy and Timing of Announcement
It is advisable to keep your job search confidential until you have another opportunity secured and a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Informing your current boss too soon could lead to an earlier-than-anticipated departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. It's also recommended to keep news of a new opportunity quiet, even from close work friends, as rumors can spread and potentially complicate your exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Maintain discretion and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Informing Your Boss
Once you have a confirmed start date, schedule a meeting with your boss, ideally face-to-face or via a video call, to deliver your resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Avoid emails or text messages for this important conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

When giving notice:
*   Keep the conversation concise and to the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   Provide minimal detail, stating that a new opportunity aligns better with your family or career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   Avoid elaborating on negative reasons for leaving, such as issues with management or the company, to prevent emotional outbursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   Approach the conversation with "emotion zero" as your decision should already be firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   Always take the high road and be the [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professional]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

### Notifying Co-workers and Clients
Your boss should be the first to know about your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. After informing your boss, ask for their guidance on when and how to inform your team, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. This ensures you follow proper protocol and leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

Remember that your departure creates a workload void for colleagues and potentially impacts clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Show grace and appreciation when communicating your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. On your last day, keep communication positive and focus on positive aspects of your time there, thanking colleagues for their support and acknowledging opportunities for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Avoid trashing the company or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

## Building and Leveraging Your Network

Graceful exits are vital for [[networking_for_job_opportunities | networking for job opportunities]] and future career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Connecting with Influential Individuals
Reach out directly to individuals who were instrumental in your career development, such as trainers, mentors, or those who provided opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Offer them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### Expanding Your Personal Network
Ask these contacts to join your personal network, specifically by connecting on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. This builds powerful connections that can be instrumental in finding future job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | Effectively Networking on LinkedIn]] is crucial for this. Leaving poorly ("guns blazing") will severely limit future [[networking_for_job_opportunities | networking opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

## The Importance of References and Maintaining Good Terms

### Giving Two Weeks' Notice
Always give at least two weeks' notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. While not legally required, it allows you to tie up loose ends and, more importantly, shows consideration for your co-workers and boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. It prevents your colleagues from having to scramble and take on your entire workload without proper transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### Preserving Future Opportunities
Maintaining a good working relationship with former colleagues and bosses is essential. You never know when circumstances might change, and you could need to return to a previous employer or seek a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. It is advisable to ask your boss if you would be considered for rehire if things do not work out at your new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Always strive to be on good terms with former bosses, as they will likely serve as references for future roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

## Your Employment Brand

How you treat people when you leave an organization will reflect on you and follow you throughout your entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Leaving on good terms and making a great impression contributes positively to your employment brand, which is critical for [[the_role_of_networking_and_selfpromotion_in_career_advancement | career advancement]] and [[importance_of_discoverability_and_networking_in_job_searching | discoverability in job searching]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

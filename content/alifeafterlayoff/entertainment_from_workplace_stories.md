Workplace experiences, particularly the more unusual ones, often find their way onto the internet, providing a source of entertainment and discussion for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These [[social_media_stories_about_workplace_experiences | social media stories about workplace experiences]] can range from humorous anecdotes to tales of significant [[company_and_employee_mixups | company and employee mixups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Bizarre Re-Interview: A Case Study

A particularly entertaining [[personal_stories_of_layoffs_and_their_coping_mechanisms | personal story of layoff and coping]] shared online involves a man known by his Twitter handle "F-i-r-r" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. After being terminated from his job, he was immediately contacted by a recruiter for an interview for the *same position* with the *same employer* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Unbeknownst to the company, they were inviting the very person they had just fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### The Setup

F-i-r-r, who was already stable with freelance work and other interviews, decided to "have a little bit of fun" with the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. He documented the entire process on Twitter in a play-by-play format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. His plan for the on-site interview included wearing his old uniform and a fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### The Interview Day

1.  **Pre-Interview Confirmation**: The hiring manager called to confirm the appointment, seemingly unaware of F-i-r-r's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The speaker in the video found it "mind-blowing" that a manager could be so disconnected from their workforce not to recognize the name of someone they had just terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
2.  **Arrival**: F-i-r-r arrived at the company building in his old uniform and fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The front desk person was "unfazed" by his appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Remarkably, his phone was still connecting to the company's Wi-Fi network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. He was then asked to wear a face mask, further obscuring his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
3.  **First Interview (Hiring Manager)**: The hiring manager was someone F-i-r-r hadn't met before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. F-i-r-r's resume was edited to remove old job names, making it a "cut and paste" of the job listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The manager, who was not technical enough to ask hard questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, brought F-i-r-r snacks, including water and gummy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. F-i-r-r noted he was in a different building than his old workspace, limiting the chances of being seen by former coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
4.  **Second Interview (Engineer)**: An engineer was brought in to ask technical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This engineer vaguely recognized F-i-r-r, asking if he'd ever "freelanced here before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. F-i-r-r truthfully replied he freelanced in a lot of places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The interview went well because F-i-r-r knew the job intimately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. He collected more snacks, including a whole bag of beef jerky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
5.  **The Revelation**: Eventually, an engineer realized F-i-r-r's true identity, and the hiring manager returned "furious" that F-i-r-r hadn't mentioned he was fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This discovery took "at least two full interviews and several hours and lots of snacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. F-i-r-r offered the manager a gummy bear, which was politely declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

The story highlights significant organizational dysfunction within the company's hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>:
*   A recruiter set up the interview for someone recently terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   The company's hiring team, including the manager, failed to recognize the candidate's name despite his recent termination just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   The hiring manager was not knowledgeable about the technical aspects of the role they were hiring for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

This [[company_and_employee_mixups | mixup]] serves as a highly entertaining example of [[workplace_culture_shifts | workplace culture shifts]] and disorganization, showcasing the potential for humor even in challenging circumstances like job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

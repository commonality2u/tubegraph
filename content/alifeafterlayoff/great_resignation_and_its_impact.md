The employment market has seen significant shifts in recent years, starting with the [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation phenomenon]], followed by quiet quitting, quiet firing, and the latest trend, career cushioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To understand these trends, it's important to examine the events in the job market over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Genesis of the Great Resignation

The journey to the [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation phenomenon]] began with the major economic downturn in 2020, caused by the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Many employers reacted with knee-jerk layoffs, which led to a ripple effect on the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Remaining employees were burdened with additional work, leading to stress, long hours, and a pervasive sentiment that they "should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Employers also demanded more from their employees while cutting expenses to maximize gains from the pandemic-induced employment event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

This period led to widespread burnout, prompting individuals to reevaluate their life and career priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Displaced workers reflected on their years of service only to be unceremoniously dismissed, while those who remained questioned their career choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This collective reevaluation set the stage for the [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation phenomenon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Great Resignation Phenomenon

The [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation phenomenon]] was a major employment trend where people began to step back and demand changes, causing a significant shift in the job market's power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The "pendulum" of power, long buried with employers, swung forcibly towards job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

During this "Heyday of job seeking," opportunities were abundant, people received raises frequently, and many left their jobs for better prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Some even left stable environments for riskier opportunities solely for higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This period defined the [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation phenomenon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Subsequent Trends

As the pendulum started to swing back towards employers, new trends emerged:

*   **Quiet Quitting**
    Those who didn't leave their jobs, but felt burned out, adopted quiet quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This was feasible because the abundance of job opportunities made the risk of repercussions less threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **Quiet Firing**
    As employers regained power and hiring slowed, the concept of quiet firing emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This involved employers subtly encouraging employees to quit rather than outright firing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

*   **Career Cushioning**
    In December 2022, the market remained shaky and uncertain, with the pendulum swinging more towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Despite overall labor market strength, some industries, particularly tech, faced significant layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. A PwC study of 722 executives revealed that 50% were reducing headcount despite concerns about hiring and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Companies are streamlining their workforces, scaling back from previous hiring booms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This environment has led to hiring freezes, reduced headcount, and the dropping of sign-on bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, with 44% rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

    This uncertain climate has given rise to career cushioning, a proactive strategy to mitigate the risk of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. It involves:
    *   Updating LinkedIn profiles and resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Monitoring job postings to understand current market demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   Actively building professional networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Applying for jobs or connecting with recruiters for "soft feelers," not necessarily an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

    Career cushioning is essentially creating a safety net, like preparing for a breakup by building alternative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. For careers, it means taking proactive steps to protect oneself and act as a "free agent," ensuring one is never caught off guard by a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This isn't a new concept, but a formalized label for what many proactive professionals already do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It is highly recommended to practice career cushioning to manage one's career trajectory and prepare for potential income disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

    To practice career cushioning:
    1.  Optimize your LinkedIn profile and build active networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    2.  Ensure your resume is current to avoid scrambling during a layoff notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    3.  Evaluate your career goals, current skill set, and identify any gaps, then create a plan while still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This preparation reduces stress and helps align job searches with core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Experiencing a layoff can be a significant emotional and psychological blow, often leading to self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While it's common to wonder why one was selected, layoffs are often not a reflection of an individual's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, but rather due to broader organizational factors such as the relevance of one's skills or a shift in departmental needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Skills and Obsolete Roles

One reason employees may be selected for a layoff is due to their skills, or a lack thereof, or because their specific role is no longer needed by the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

While this might seem like a performance issue, it's distinct because it relates to skills becoming obsolete or the company no longer requiring certain job types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. If an organization has evolved beyond a certain skill set or role and an employee hasn't adapted with the market, they may find themselves on a layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

This trend is expected to [[the_role_of_ai_in_layoffs_and_workforce_reduction | accelerate with the rise of AI's popularity in the workplace]], emphasizing a need to adapt or be left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

To mitigate this risk, individuals should:
*   Closely monitor industry trends and market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   Ensure they possess the latest software and technical skills in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   Pay attention to the company's evolving direction and be proactive in reskilling to become experts in new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Departmental Need and Strategic Shifts

Another common reason for layoffs, particularly observed in the tech sector, is changes in departmental needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This occurs when a department alters its focus, deemphasizes certain products or groups, and consequently no longer requires specific positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

These layoffs are not performance-related but are a result of the organization's [[cost_cutting_measures_and_their_effects_on_layoffs | strategic direction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Unfortunately, even top performers or those recently promoted into a division can be affected if the leadership changes strategic direction, leading to the deemphasis of their project or role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Such instances occur through no fault of the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

While impossible to predict entirely, individuals can de-risk their situation by:
*   Avoiding organizations focused on experimental new projects or "skunk works" during times of economic uncertainty, as these are often the first to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   Being cautious about joining teams or divisions that are not part of the core business or are not generating significant revenue, as these might be targeted for downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

It's important to remember that being laid off due to skills or departmental changes does not imply an individual is "damaged goods" or a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Instead, it highlights the importance of continually building diverse skill sets and considering one's career as a "CEO" by staying marketable and adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

When preparing for an interview, especially when anticipating questions about [[handling_questions_about_salary_expectations | salary expectations]], it is crucial to research the average salary range for the specific role in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This step requires an "investigative cap" to dig for relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Methods for Salary Research

To find out the average salary for a role, consider the following methods:
*   **Google Search** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
*   **Salary Websites** Utilize platforms like Glassdoor or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Recent Job Postings** Look at other similar roles that have been recently posted to see their compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Research

When researching, it's essential to be as realistic as possible:
*   **Local Market Wages** If using tools like Glassdoor or Salary.com, ensure you are comparing jobs in your local area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Salaries can vary significantly by location; for example, wages in Alabama will likely differ from those in the Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Company Expectations** Beyond the market rate, try to gauge what the specific company is expecting to pay for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Your Bottom Line** While not shared directly with the recruiter, understand your absolute minimum acceptable salary, as this dictates when you would need to walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Having a solid understanding of the market range allows you to frame your answer effectively during an interview. For instance, you can state, "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110,000. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This approach puts the onus on the company to clarify if their target aligns with market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

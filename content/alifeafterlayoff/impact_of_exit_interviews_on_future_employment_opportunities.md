When an employee tenders their resignation, Human Resources (HR) may invite them to participate in an [[purpose_of_exit_interviews | exit interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While these interviews are primarily conducted to collect data on workplace trends and identify issues like uncompetitive compensation or problematic management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, there is an "inadvertent dark side" that could potentially harm the departing employee's future employment prospects with that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Potential Detriments to Re-employment

Participating in an [[potential_drawbacks_of_participating_in_exit_interviews | exit interview]] often offers the employee almost no personal gain, but carries the risk of potential loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. If an employee uses the interview to vent about negative experiences—such as issues with a manager, lack of promotional opportunities, underpayment, or a toxic work environment—this feedback is often documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

The act of "spewing out" gripes during an exit interview results in the creation of a document detailing these issues, which may then be associated with the employee's permanent employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This can effectively "burn a bridge" with the former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. If the individual ever wishes to apply for a job with that employer again in the future, these documented reasons for their departure, and the manner in which they quit, may be referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Negativity associated with the exit interview could result in the individual being categorized as "not hirable" by that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Exit Interviews and Reference Checks

There is a misconception that details from an exit interview might be shared with new employers during reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. However, when a company conducts reference checks for a candidate, the previous employer typically does not inquire about or disclose information from the exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Companies are often cautious about discussing specific reasons for an employee's departure with a new employer, as doing so could potentially lead to legal liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

## Deciding to Participate

While an [[potential_drawbacks_of_participating_in_exit_interviews | exit interview]] is strictly voluntary and employers cannot penalize an employee for declining to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, some individuals who are "100% certain" they will never return to that employer might choose to fully disclose their true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This may be seen as the only real opportunity to express frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. However, it is important to consider the audience—typically an HR representative who may not have decision-making authority—and the likelihood of actual change occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Often, such feedback may "fall on deaf ears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Generally, it is not recommended to participate in an [[potential_drawbacks_of_participating_in_exit_interviews | exit interview]] due to the potential negative impact on future re-employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

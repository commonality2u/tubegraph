During an interview, it is crucial to avoid speaking negatively about your previous company or boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. While it might be tempting to criticize a former employer or discuss a difficult work environment, recruiters are not interested in hearing about such issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The interviewer's primary goal is to determine if you are a good fit for their company and the specific role, not to serve as a "sounding board" for past grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Talking poorly about previous experiences reflects negatively on you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Instead, candidates should:
*   Be gracious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>
*   Show how they applied learning from past situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   Demonstrate genuine interest in the current opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>

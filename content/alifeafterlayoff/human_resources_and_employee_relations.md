This article examines a case study involving an employee, her manager, and the human resources department, sparked by a viral TikTok video posted by an employee named Alisyn, detailing a toxic interaction with her boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The situation highlights complex dynamics within employee relations, prompting an analysis of whether the issue stemmed from a toxic boss, a toxic company, a toxic [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | human resources department]], or a toxic employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Employee's Account (Alisyn's Perspective)

Alisyn's content series on TikTok centers around her unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. She shared an interaction with her former manager, which unexpectedly went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Key points from Alisyn's perspective:
*   **New Manager Dynamics**: After a year, her previous "wonderful manager" was replaced by a new manager who seemed "determined to hate me from day one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. She noted that while other teams had interviews for new hires, her manager was simply brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Workload and Compensation**: Alisyn absorbed half of her previous manager's responsibilities, which were not shifted back to the new manager, leading her to make less money than when she started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. She perceived her boss as "doing absolutely nothing" while earning a six-figure salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Communication and Support Issues**: The new manager allegedly avoided Alisyn, told her to find answers elsewhere when asked for help, and had her Outlook calendar hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **PTO and Coverage Problems**: Alisyn had accrued over 100 hours of PTO but, upon taking a week off after four months, found the team email inbox completely ignored during her absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. She had created detailed notes for coverage, but her manager left for two days without prior notice, impacting the handover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Escalation and Retaliation Claims**:
    *   Feeling "screwed" and "emotional" after her PTO, Alisyn emailed the director expressing concern about the lack of coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This prompted a "last minute meeting" with her manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   She reported her manager multiple times to [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]], but [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]] claimed they "could never prove" the bad treatment because meetings weren't recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
    *   Things allegedly worsened, with the company making her physically count every email sent and received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Layoff and Legal Action**: Alisyn was laid off in April for "financial reasons," but she disputes this, noting a new person was hired for an open position on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. She sent video evidence to [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]] leadership, but "nothing happened," and her manager kept her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. She contacted the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) but they declined to investigate further, stating her manager would have needed to be "more specific about her discrimination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Public Outcry and Cease and Desist**: Alisyn posted her viral video on LinkedIn, tagging the CEOs of the companies involved (McKesson and SRI), and received a cease and desist letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. She publicly responded to the letter, accusing the companies of illegally laying her off due to her complaints of harassment, bullying, and discrimination, and claiming she had audio recordings of disparaging remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

## Analysis of Employee Relations and [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | Human Resources]]

The speaker, a career coach with experience in management and [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]], offers several insights and critiques:

### New Management and [[changes_in_corporate_loyalty_and_employment_practices | Employee Loyalty]]
*   **New Manager Assessment**: A new manager, especially from outside the organization, arrives with their own ideas of "what good looks like" and unique biases, potentially assessing the existing team differently than the original hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Red Flag for Employees**: If a new boss wasn't directly involved in hiring an employee, it can be a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. In such cases, employees should consider updating their resume and networking, as the relationship might become unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is particularly true if a new senior leader reorganizes everything and isn't fully "bought into" existing staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Employee Conduct and Professionalism
*   **Judging Management**: Alisyn's assumption that her boss did "absolutely nothing" is a judgment based on her limited perspective, as she wouldn't know the full scope of her manager's duties or interactions with senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Delegating Upward**: The employee appeared to be delegating upward by telling her manager what needed to be done and how to handle it, which could "rub a manager the wrong way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **De-escalation**: During the heated conversation, the speaker advises the employee to "back down and try to deescalate this situation" rather than engage in "minutiae" and escalate the manager's frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Continuing to argue and express frustration is seen as combative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Professionalism and Respect**: Despite dissatisfaction with a boss, employees must maintain a level of professionalism and respect in interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Unauthorized Overtime**: The employee's decision to work 5.5 hours of unauthorized overtime to create notes, which were not needed or utilized by the boss, could be an issue for management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### The Role of [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | Human Resources]]
*   **[[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]] is Not Your Friend**: The speaker emphasizes that [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]] is not there to be an employee's confidante or the "police of the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Target on Your Back**: Complaining to [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]] can put a "target on your back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. [[handling_employee_complaints | HR]] will immediately pull the employee's file to review their performance history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Investigation Process**: [[handling_employee_complaints | HR]] will investigate complaints by speaking with senior leaders and the manager in question, seeking "facts" over "emotional feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Repeated Complaints**: If an employee complains multiple times without concrete evidence, [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]] may begin to view the employee as "a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **EEOC Perspective**: The EEOC is heavily employee-focused, operating on the premise that the employer is "guilty until proven innocent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Their decision not to investigate Alisyn's case indicates "she had absolutely no case" for discrimination as per their strict definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Employers must have their "ducks in a row" to defend adverse employment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### [[impact_of_hr_decisions_on_careers | Impact of HR Decisions on Careers]] and [[changes_in_corporate_loyalty_and_employment_practices | Corporate Loyalty]]
*   **Recording Conversations**: Recording a manager without their knowledge or consent, then posting it publicly, can lead to serious legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Public Exposure**: Publicly airing grievances on platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok, especially by tagging CEOs, can "scarlet letter" an employee, making them appear a "toxic candidate" for future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Recruiters and hiring teams actively check social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
*   **Moving On**: The speaker advises that everyone will encounter a bad boss or toxic workplace at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. It is better to "walk away" and "leave it in the past" rather than risking one's entire career over a single negative situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
*   **Recommendations**: Employees in similar situations should avoid recording conversations, posting grievances on social media, or escalating issues to [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]] and senior leadership without a clear strategy. Instead, focus on finding a new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The situation presented a complex interplay of managerial communication failures, an employee's perceived disrespect and combative behavior, and the realities of [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | HR]]'s role within an organization. While the manager exhibited poor communication, the employee's approach to resolving the issues, including public complaints and confrontational interactions, ultimately led to her being deemed "the problem" by the company and her career being negatively impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

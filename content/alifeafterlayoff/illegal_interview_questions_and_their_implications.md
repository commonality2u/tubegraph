Job seekers should be selective when choosing roles, as a poor employer can hinder career progression for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Spotting bad employers pays dividends throughout a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. As a candidate, you should interview the employer as much as, if not more than, they interview you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Encountering [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags in job interviews]] can help identify unsuitable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Identifying Illegal Questions

One major [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] in an interview is when an employer asks [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Certain inquiries are strictly off-limits in an interview setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Prohibited Topics

Employers cannot ask about:
*   Race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Creed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   Color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

These questions are considered discriminatory because they have no bearing on a candidate's ability to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Common Examples of Illegal Questions

*   **Family Planning**
    If an employer asks, "Are you planning to start a family?" it is a discriminatory question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This type of question often aims to determine if the employer will need to pay for maternity or paternity leave, or if they can assume a lack of long-term commitment to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Religion**
    Inquiries about a candidate's religion are also illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For example, if an interviewer assumes a candidate's religion based on their descent and asks about needing time off for prayer, this is illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Questions must be job-specific and related to the ability to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Past Compensation**
    A question commonly brought up in interviews, but illegal in many states, concerns a candidate's last compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Many states have legislated against asking this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The rationale is that an individual should be paid what the job is worth and for the value they bring, not based on what a previous employer paid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Being in a low-paying job previously should not affect future career earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Implications of Illegal Questions

Even if hiring managers have limited interview training, it does not excuse asking [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Ignorance of the law does not make it appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. If an employer asks any of these [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal questions]], it is considered a major [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Solid employees should be very selective about the roles they accept, as one bad employer can set back a career by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. As a job seeker, it can be easy to fall into desperation and accept any position, but some jobs should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:42">[09:11:42]</a>. Recognizing red flags in the interview process can help avoid poor quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

## Red Flag: Company Not Properly Funded

A significant red flag to look for in an interview is a company that appears to be inadequately funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:27">[06:27:27]</a>.

### Indicators of Funding Issues
*   **Lack of Longevity** While a new company, such as a [[tech_layoffs_and_job_market_challenges | tech startup]] with an exciting product, might have legitimate reasons for its short existence, even reputable startups must have proper funding to pay employees what they're worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:17">[06:30:17]</a>.
*   **"Bootstrapped" Funding** If an employer states they are "bootstrapped for funding" and cannot afford to pay more, this is a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:08">[06:43:08]</a>. This often means they will be "bootstrapped on everything else," significantly reducing their chances of business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:03">[06:49:03]</a>.
*   **Sudden Appearance** Be cautious if a company seems to have "popped up overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>. Investigate the company's legitimacy by checking:
    *   Their website for generic language, stock photos, or a lack of press releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:31">[06:57:31]</a>.
    *   Whether they have a legitimate business address or multiple physical locations that can be visited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:40">[07:02:40]</a>. It might even be beneficial to drive by the office to confirm people are working there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:37">[07:07:37]</a>.
    *   If they possess the proper resources to pursue their business markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:12">[07:12:12]</a>.
*   **Requests for Personal Equipment** A significant red flag is if a company asks you to provide your own equipment for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:20">[07:15:20]</a>. Solid companies typically cover costs for training, expenses, equipment, transportation, and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:27">[07:18:27]</a>.

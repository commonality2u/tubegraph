The modern workplace is significantly influenced by [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_advancements_in_job_displacement | technology advancements]] and social media, which present both challenges and opportunities for employees and employers alike. The integration of digital tools and platforms has reshaped [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | workplace relationships and dynamics]] and [[changes_in_work_culture_postpandemic | work culture]].

## Impact of Social Media on Professionalism
One of the most frequently cited concerns by employers regarding recent college graduates, particularly Gen Z, is the use of social media and personal devices in the workplace.
- Many employers observe that young workers are constantly on their phones [00:10:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
- There's a perception that younger generations have not adequately separated their personal and professional lives on social media [00:09:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
- Employers actively check candidates' social media profiles before hiring to assess their fit within the company culture [00:08:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
- Posting content about slacking off at work on platforms like TikTok can create negative impressions [00:08:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

> "I sit here and I watch some of these Tik Tok videos of people slacking off at work and they're bragging about it and I'm thinking to myself like do you not think that your employer or your boss or somebody on your team is going to see this and maybe not have a great impression of you as a result..."

### Case Studies in Phone Misuse
Several anecdotes highlight the severity of phone-related issues in the workplace:
- One accounting professional was frequently reprimanded for being on her phone due to the job being "boring" and the "company culture sucked" [00:13:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Her desk was physically moved to be in front of management to monitor her phone use [00:13:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
- A brand-new nurse graduate in an emergency department would not stay off her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and even texted friends about patients [00:11:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. When her phone was taken away, she had a "tantrum" and ultimately chose her phone over her job [00:11:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This incident led to the department stopping the hiring of new nurse graduates [00:11:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Technology Skills and Attention Spans
Despite growing up with technology, some employers report a surprising lack of fundamental technical skills among recent graduates [00:04:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. There is a "disconnect" between what colleges teach and the "real-life skills" needed in the workplace [00:04:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

The prevalence of social media is also linked to shorter attention spans among younger workers, with employers noting difficulty focusing on work for more than ten minutes [00:10:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This constant need for "instant feedback loop" and "dopamine hit" from devices can be a significant challenge in a professional setting [00:10:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Employers' Expectations for Technology Use
Employers are looking for individuals who demonstrate:
- Solid technical skills [00:08:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
- Appropriate social media use, understanding that professional and personal boundaries are distinct [00:08:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
- The ability to put down phones and focus during work hours [00:10:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Positive Influence on [[changes_in_work_culture_postpandemic | Workplace Culture]]
While there are challenges, Gen Z employees are also driving positive [[changing_expectations_in_the_modern_workplace | changes in work culture]], particularly regarding [[employee_burnout_and_digital_overload | work-life balance]] [00:22:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. This focus on balance is a welcome shift in an increasingly unhealthy and imbalanced work environment [00:22:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

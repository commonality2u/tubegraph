When an employee seeks new opportunities due to dissatisfaction at work and receives an offer from another company, their current employer may respond with a counteroffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This can be a stressful situation for the individual, weighing a new opportunity against a promise of better conditions from their current workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. However, insights from corporate recruiters with over 20 years of experience suggest that accepting a counteroffer is rarely beneficial for an employee's [[Longterm career impact of accepting counteroffers | long-term career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Seeking New Employment
Employees often look for new jobs due to various factors, including feeling underappreciated or underpaid, being passed over for promotions, or being completely overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. These motivators for a [[Employee dissatisfaction and career changes | career change]] — such as a bad boss, poor company culture, work-life balance issues, long commutes, or terrible benefits — typically persist even after a counteroffer is accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## Counteroffers and Their Impact
When an employee signals their intent to leave, a company may scramble to make a counteroffer, often including a new job title and a bigger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This action often implies that the company was undervaluing the employee until they threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The speaker, a corporate recruiter, asserts that you should "never accept a counteroffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

### Why Companies Counter
A counteroffer might be an attempt by the current employer to buy themselves time to find a replacement for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. By accepting a counter, the employee effectively makes themselves redundant, as the employer will now focus on developing a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Employee Retention Statistics Post-Counteroffer

Statistics indicate a very low rate of [[Employee retention statistics post-counteroffer | employee retention]] after accepting a counteroffer:
*   An overwhelming majority — 80% or more — of people who accept counteroffers will not be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   An even more staggering 93% will not be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Personal experience from a corporate recruiter supports these statistics: candidates who accept counters are almost always back on the market looking for a new position within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## [[Reasons to decline a counter offer | Reasons Counteroffers Often Fail]]
Even if a counteroffer includes a promotion or expanded responsibilities, the fundamental issues that led to the job search typically remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The initial "honeymoon period" after accepting the counteroffer will eventually wear off, and the employee will face the same problems again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

### Impact on Relationships and Security
*   **Changed Relationships:** Once an employee broadcasts their intention to leave, relationships with colleagues and senior leaders are unlikely to be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Senior leaders may view the employee as less dedicated, potentially passing them over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Job Security Concerns:** Employees who accept counteroffers may be labeled as not long-term committed to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Consequently, if the company faces a rough patch, these individuals might be among the first considered for layoffs, especially if they now have a higher salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[Evaluating job security and company loyalty | evaluating job security]].

## Real-Life Example
A corporate recruiter recounted an instance where a candidate, driving across the country for a new job, accepted a counteroffer halfway to their destination and returned home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Within six months, the candidate contacted the recruiter, admitting that accepting the counteroffer was a "big mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

The decision to leave a job is often made for a good reason, and it's essential for individuals to be "selfish with their career" as companies do not prioritize individual careers and can lay off long-tenured employees without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

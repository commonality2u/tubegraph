The Romini app is a tool that leverages [[ai_technology_in_professional_photography | AI technology]] to create professional headshots from selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. It has gained popularity, going viral for its ability to produce convincing professional headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. This technology presents a potential new option for individuals who are not satisfied with their current [[linkedin_profile_strategy_and_headshot_importance | LinkedIn profile headshot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## How Romini Works

Users upload 8 to 12 selfies to the Romini app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The app then processes these images to generate a custom profile and produces a selection of headshots suitable for professional platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The process includes selecting a gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a> and a reference image style to guide the generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Examples and User Experience

The app has demonstrated remarkable results, with examples showing original photos transformed into highly professional and convincing AI-generated headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. These generated photos often look like professional headshots, placing subjects in various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. While most results appear seamless and convincing, some may look "a little bit fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The speaker experimented with the Romini app, uploading personal selfies and choosing a "modern, not too stuffy" aesthetic as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The initial generated photos made the speaker look younger and were considered "not bad at all," with one potentially usable for a [[linkedin_profile_strategy_and_headshot_importance | LinkedIn profile]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. The speaker also generated a headshot for his wife, noting the "pretty remarkable" results and creating a "power couple" image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Impact on Professionals and Recommendations

The rise of [[creating_linkedin_headshots_using_ai | AI-generated headshots]] presents an "interesting dilemma" for professional headshot photographers, raising questions about the [[impact_of_ai_on_professional_headshot_photographers | impact of AI on professional headshot photographers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### Important Considerations

A key concern with using the Romini app is the potential for "catfishing," where the generated photo does not accurately represent the user's current appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a> My recommendation would be to use Source photos that accurately represent how you currently look. Use this tool to give yourself a clean and professional looking headshot. I wouldn't advise it if it's going to completely catfish you to the world.

The speaker's overall impression is that Romini can produce "pretty good and pretty convincing headshots" using [[ai_technology_in_professional_photography | AI technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. For those looking to upgrade their [[linkedin_profile_strategy_and_headshot_importance | LinkedIn profile]] without spending a fortune on professional photography, the Romini app is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

To significantly [[strategies_to_improve_job_application_success | speed up your job search]], a highly effective method is to set up job alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This [[utilizing_efficiency_tools_in_job_search | efficiency tool]] helps you stay informed without constantly checking job boards manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Benefits of Job Alerts

Setting up alerts is a major time-saver because it eliminates the need to repeatedly visit job boards and hit the refresh button every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This tedious and arduous process can also be detrimental to your mental health, especially if few jobs are being posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Alerts ensure you receive notifications directly, saving considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## How to Set Up Alerts

Almost every job board offers the functionality to set up alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. You can configure an alert for specific keywords or job types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, and the platform will then email you whenever new job postings match your criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Where to Set Up Alerts

### Major Job Boards
When [[using_job_boards_effectively | using job boards effectively]], it's recommended to narrow your focus to well-known platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, or Google Job Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These major boards typically propagate job postings from company corporate career pages, ensuring you find most relevant opportunities there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Avoid getting bogged down by niche or obscure sites, as jobs posted there will likely also appear on the major boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Company ATS Systems
Beyond general job boards, you can also set up alerts on most companies' Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. If you have a specific company of interest, setting up these alerts ensures you are notified directly when relevant positions become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Why Early Application Matters

Being early to apply for a job is always preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Applying late in the process means the employer may have already identified a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Job alerts help you apply promptly, increasing your chances of being noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Successfully navigating a career often involves understanding that skills and contributions must remain current and valuable. While being exceptionally good at a specific task can provide a competitive advantage, the speaker emphasizes that [[importance_of_updating_career_skills_and_knowledge | relevant skills]] are more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Evolving Value of Skills

Employers will value a specific skill only as long as they need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. A company might prioritize a certain skill or even retrain employees for it, but if that skill is no longer required, the individual's relevance within the organization diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Furthermore, skills that are highly valued by one employer might not be valued the same way by others in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This can lead to a situation where an individual's resume is filled with skills that no one else cares about, causing them to feel stuck and potentially settle for lower-quality jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

> [!TIP] Focus on skills that are highly in demand by multiple employers, not just your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Current Contribution is Key

Another critical lesson is that a professional is often "only as good as what you've done last," or, phrased differently, "what have you done for me lately?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. While past achievements and built-up goodwill might offer a short reprieve, it's typically very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

If an employer perceives that an employee is no longer contributing, or if their skills are not aligned with future needs, they may find themselves in a precarious position, such as being on a layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This can be jarring, especially for those who felt they had demonstrated significant loyalty and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Acting as the CEO of Your Career

Senior leaders prioritize future productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Therefore, individuals must act like a "free agent" in their career, always prioritizing their own professional development and trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

To [[Strategies for career control and adaptation | act as the CEO of your career]], you must adopt multiple roles, including that of your own marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This involves proactively marketing your effectiveness within your company, department, and job, as well as on the open market during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The speaker encourages taking ownership and approaching one's career with greater strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

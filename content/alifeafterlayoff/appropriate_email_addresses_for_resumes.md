When crafting a resume, it is crucial to avoid unprofessional email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Recruiters consistently observe "colorful" email addresses and question their appropriateness for a professional document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Why Unprofessional Email Addresses are a Problem

Using an email address that dates back to college years, such as "I usually party" or "partyboy28@yahoo.com," can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. The objective is to avoid giving the hiring manager any reason to make assumptions or judgments about a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

## Recommendations for a Professional Email

It is highly recommended to create a new, clean email address for job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. A good option is a Gmail account using your full name or a relatively neutral moniker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Avoid using nicknames or anything that could potentially lead to discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

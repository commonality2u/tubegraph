An aloof boss is generally a likable person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, they don't seem to know what is happening in their department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

*   Not well-connected to the work you are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Not very helpful in clearing roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Requires repeated reminders to follow up on commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

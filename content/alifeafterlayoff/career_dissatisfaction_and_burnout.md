Many individuals frequently express dissatisfaction in their careers or with the type of work they are performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This often comes up in private consultation sessions where people are struggling with their [[Career management and development | career direction]] or lack motivation for their current job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Work to Live vs. Live to Work

A fundamental question explored in career philosophy is whether one "works to live" or "lives to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The majority of the working population likely "works to live," meaning their employment serves to enable a desired lifestyle rather than being their core purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It is estimated that approximately 70% of people would stop their current job if they won the lottery, indicating a preference for doing something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

There is nothing inherently wrong with being someone who works to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Society often ingrains a culture of being career-minded or wanting to [[Career advancement and job satisfaction | climb the corporate ladder]], but not everyone is suited for or desires that path to satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## [[Signs of burnout in the workplace | Signs of Career Dissatisfaction]]

Many people, even those who appear successful externally, experience a sense of dread about going to work on Monday mornings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Spending 20 or 30 years in a career without passion for it is considered concerning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Common indicators of dissatisfaction include:
*   Lack of motivation to go to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Not feeling a "burning drive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Hating one's job or career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
*   Struggling through the work week, looking forward to the weekend, and feeling dread by Sunday afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>

## Reasons for Career Dissatisfaction

Several factors contribute to widespread dissatisfaction in careers:

*   **Workplace Culture Issues** Companies can have cultural issues that do not align with an individual's core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Office politics can significantly sidetrack a career, especially in the corporate world, if one doesn't play the game or gets on the wrong side of a superior or colleague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of Fulfillment** Many are in career paths that do not provide deep, core satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. They simply "power through" or try to make it through the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **[[Employee Burnout and Digital Overload | Job Overloading]]** A significant number of people deal with excessive workloads, where 40-hour work weeks are a myth, and 60-70 hour weeks are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This can lead to being "worked to death" and indicates a lack of sufficient resources or staffing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[Work life balance and its challenges | Work-Life Balance]]** Most people desire a balance between work and personal life, aiming to do a fair job for fair pay and then spend time with family or pursue passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. However, cultures, especially in places like the United States, are often work-driven, making this balance difficult to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This imbalance fuels career dissatisfaction in a perpetual cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## How People End Up in Unsatisfying Careers

The path to career dissatisfaction often begins early, due to a lack of a definitive "end game" or goal when entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Early Career Choices** Many fall into their first job, often the one that hires them out of college for experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This initial placement, whether by industry or type of work, shapes the early career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Promotions or opportunities can lead individuals down career paths they never planned or had an idea of wanting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Branding and [[Loss of career momentum and compensation issues | Getting Trapped]]** As one progresses, they become "branded" by the type of work they do, leading to recruitment into similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This can lead to feeling trapped due to becoming accustomed to a certain lifestyle and salary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Mid-Career Realization** Many realize their dissatisfaction between the 10- to 20-year mark, finding themselves deep into a career they don't like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. At this stage, attempting a [[Career navigation in times of layoffs and job insecurity | career shift]] can be very difficult, risking a step backward in salary or finding another unfulfilling path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Ultimately, this situation is often a symptom of deviating from an optimal path early on due to the absence of a guiding light or principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Without a true plan, careers unfold aimlessly, leading to the realization of wasted years in unsatisfying work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Addressing Career Dissatisfaction

To combat career dissatisfaction, individuals must take action and make a definitive plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

*   **Define Your Guiding Light** The most crucial step is to figure out your "guiding light" â€“ a principle, goal, or desired position that you are working toward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Advantage for Early Career Professionals** Those early in their careers have a significant advantage, as they can put a guiding principle and plan in place, taking calculated steps toward their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The "power of time" allows for taking risks and changing direction if something isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. If a job isn't resonating, it's advisable to "cut bait" and try something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Pivoting Later in Career** Even for those on the "far side of their career" (post-age 40), it is possible to pivot, though it requires more calculated decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The focus should be on thinking bigger and not merely returning to another unsatisfying career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Don't Tolerate Bad Situations** It is crucial not to tolerate bad situations, such as toxic work cultures, poor pay, or unaligned industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Staying in such situations can make future career progression harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Continued dissatisfaction will persist without a plan to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Living 10, 15, 20, or 30 years in a career without passion is considered "absolutely awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. It challenges individuals to consider what they are doing about their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

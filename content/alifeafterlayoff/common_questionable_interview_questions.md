Job seeking and interviewing are inherently difficult, but encountering low-quality employers asking suspicious questions can make the process even more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Employers often provide "tells" or [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flags]] that, if paid close attention to, can indicate a low-quality opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

Here are some common interview questions that may signal a need for caution or even prompt a candidate to withdraw their application:

## Questions Indicating Potential Issues

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
While seemingly innocent, this question often indicates an employer's concern about a candidate's attendance record, especially for hourly positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. If an employer is highly focused on attendance, it likely means they have dealt with attendance issues previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This can suggest an overly particular and potentially inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Most people want the flexibility to call off when sick without repercussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

*   **Suggested Action**: Ask the interviewer about their expectations regarding unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. If their response indicates a strict approach, it might be a sign of a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
This question can indicate that an employer is trying to determine the lowest possible salary to get a candidate to accept an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It suggests a lack of flexibility in compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

*   **Red Flag**: An employer that tries to lowball you from the start may continue to do so when it comes to raises or promotions, making it difficult to maintain a competitive salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
This question can signal a potential turnover problem within the company or the specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. It prompts the candidate to question why people are leaving so quickly that this commitment is being assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

*   **Red Flag**: This question has little bearing on a candidate's potential success in the job and may reflect an employer's bias or a deeper cultural issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### "Have you ever been fired?"
This question delves into past employment decisions that are often not relevant to a candidate's ability to perform in the current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Past performance is not always the best indicator of future performance, and a previous negative experience shouldn't tarnish a candidate's entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

*   **Suggested Action**: Redirect the conversation to focus on future potential and accomplishments in past roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. If the interviewer continues to probe aggressively, withdrawing candidacy may be advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Accusations of Exaggeration or Embellishment on Your Resume
Assuming a candidate has not embellished their resume, an interviewer who accuses them of exaggeration indicates a fundamental lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This can be a sign of a toxic employer who assumes everyone is lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

*   **Red Flag**: Starting a new job with an employer who already distrusts you can be a strong indicator of a negative work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
This is often considered a [[common_trap_interview_questions | trap question]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. While the intent might be to understand how a candidate overcomes adversity, there are better ways to phrase such a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Focusing on failures can lead to bias against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

*   **Suggested Action**: If forced to answer, focus less on the failure itself and more on how the adversity was overcome, framing it positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### Asking About Availability for Off-Shifts or Weekends (for a standard shift role)
Common in hourly roles, but also seen in salary positions, this question about working outside of typical hours indicates a high likelihood of mandatory overtime or an imbalanced work-life dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

*   **Suggested Action**: Push back on the interviewer to get clear expectations on true work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### Asking About On-Site Availability for a Remote Job
If an employer advertises a job as remote but asks about your availability to come on-site regularly, it's likely a hybrid position, not fully remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

*   **Red Flag**: In today's market, a "hybrid" role pitched as remote has a high probability of eventually becoming 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. This is a significant [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] for those seeking genuinely remote positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
This question immediately raises concern about the workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. It makes a candidate wonder if they will be working with difficult individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. If the manager is noted as rude, it's a major [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

*   **Red Flag**: This question is a strong indicator of an existing cultural issue within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## A Non-Question Red Flag: Lack of Opportunity to Ask Questions

A significant [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] is when the interviewer does not provide an opportunity for the candidate to ask their own questions and dominates the entire conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. An interview should be a two-way street, where the candidate also assesses the company and the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

*   **Red Flag**: If an interviewer takes offense to a candidate asking questions, it suggests they believe they are "above" being assessed, which indicates a poor company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While one or two of these [[common_interview_questions_and_meanings | questionable interview questions]] may not definitively mean a company is low-quality, they serve as [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flags]] and additional data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. It is crucial to ask good probing questions in response to ensure you understand the work environment before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

Human Resources (HR) departments often employ strategies that can lead to employees being paid less than they deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. They frequently hide behind processes and policies to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, aiming to secure employees at the cheapest possible price, especially if the candidate is inexperienced in [[effective_salary_negotiation_strategies | salary negotiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## How HR Approaches Salary Negotiations

*   **Early Negotiation Commencement**
    [[negotiation_strategies_for_salary_expectations | Salary negotiation]] effectively begins the moment a job application is submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Rigid Salary Bands**
    HR departments may try to fit candidates into very narrow and often rigid salary bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **"Internal Equity" as an Excuse**
    They might use "internal equity" as a justification for why a higher salary cannot be offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This is a common tactic to influence [[factors_influencing_salary_decisions_in_job_offers | salary decisions]] and [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers | job offers]] by framing an offer within the context of existing employees' compensation.
*   **Promises of Future Revisions**
    A common strategy is to present a [[dealing_with_a_lowball_salary_offer | lower-than-expected offer]] with promises to revisit the salary in a few months or to implement a revision after a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. However, these promises often do not materialize unless they are explicitly included in the official offer letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Without written documentation, proving these commitments can be very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Limiting Raises and Promotions**
    HR may also use salary bands as an excuse to deny appropriate raises or to offer promotions "in name only" without a corresponding pay increase, claiming the employee is already at the top end of their salary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Employee Leverage in Negotiations

Despite these tactics, HR departments can be flexible when faced with specific circumstances:
*   **Rockstar Candidates**: When a highly sought-after candidate demands a higher-than-expected salary, HR often finds ways to accommodate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of demonstrating your value and standing out during [[discussing_salary_expectations_in_interviews | interviews]] and [[approaching_the_question_of_salary_expectations_in_interviews | discussions]] about [[effective_ways_to_discuss_salary_expectations | salary expectations]].
*   **Critical Role Resignations**: If an employee in a critical role tenders their resignation, HR can suddenly "move mountains" to make things happen, including adjusting salary, to retain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Knowing these dynamics can help individuals navigate their careers with greater precision and reclaim control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

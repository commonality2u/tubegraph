Making career mistakes is common, and often these lessons are learned the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many common pitfalls identified through coaching calls include staying in a job too long, not responding to opportunities, or accepting a poor-fit role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Over-focusing on a specific career vertical without realizing it's not resonating can lead to difficulty in making changes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Loyalty Rarely Pays Off
A significant lesson learned is that company loyalty rarely benefits an individual's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Staying in a role for too long due to loyalty, expecting to pay dues and eventually get promoted, can lead to the market moving past you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This can result in being significantly behind peers in terms of responsibility, level, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Hard Work vs. Smart Work
A common misconception is that hard work directly leads to promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Putting in excessive hours, especially under a workaholic boss, does not guarantee career advancement and may not lead to promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The key is to [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_advancement | work smart]], not just hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Working smart involves:
*   **Focusing on Visible Projects** Working on projects that your boss and your boss's boss care about is crucial for recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. If your work isn't aligned with their priorities, your efforts might not be recognized in the way you hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Announcing Your Achievements** Beyond completing highly visible projects, it's essential to let people know about your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Being Your Own Advocate
To progress in your career, you must be your own advocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. No one else in the organization will advocate for your promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Key aspects of self-advocacy include:
*   **Understanding the Promotion Game** You have two choices: learn the rules of the game and participate, or remain on the sidelines and watch others get promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Targeting the Right Audience** Your boss is often not the decision-maker for promotions; it's typically your boss's boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Find ways to become visible and engage with senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **[[taking_ownership_of_your_career | Being the CEO of Your Career]]** Acting as the CEO of your career means wearing multiple hats, including serving as your own marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This involves creating "campaigns" to market your effectiveness within your company, department, and role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. It also applies to interviews in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Embracing Change** If you aspire to move up in an organization, you must overcome stubbornness and actively pursue opportunities for growth and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## The Importance of Relevant Skills
While being excellent at a specific task can be an advantage, [[importance_of_updating_career_skills_and_knowledge | relevant skills]] are more critical for long-term career resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Employers value skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Skills valued by one employer or project may not be valued by others in the industry, potentially leading to a resume full of irrelevant skills and difficulty securing a suitable job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The focus should be on developing skills that are highly in demand by multiple employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Continuous Contribution
You are only as good as what you've done recently, or "what have you done for me lately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Past successes or built-up goodwill typically have a short shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. If employers perceive that you are no longer contributing or cannot contribute in the future, your position may be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This can lead to unexpected layoffs, even for those who felt they had strong contributions and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Senior leaders are primarily concerned with future production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to [[being_selfish_in_your_career | act like a free agent in your career]] and prioritize your own advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. [[the_importance_of_valuing_oneself_in_the_job_market | Putting yourself first]] in your career is not negative; it's a smart [[strategies_for_protecting_your_career | strategy for career protection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
To truly [[taking_ownership_of_your_career | take ownership of your career]] and approach it with [[the_importance_of_being_a_proactive_career_planner | more strategy]], individuals should learn how to act as the CEO of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This involves [[importance_of_career_planning_and_having_a_guiding_principle | reclaiming control]] and making deliberate choices about one's professional path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

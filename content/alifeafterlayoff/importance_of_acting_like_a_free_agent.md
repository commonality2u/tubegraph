This approach encourages a proactive stance to career development and financial security, especially given the inherent power dynamic where the paycheck signer holds ultimate control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Even during periods when the job market favors employees, the underlying truth remains that the employer controls the employment arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Proactive Preparation

*   Ensuring budgeting is in order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

*   Actively fighting for your income and career progression, as no one else will do it for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Self-Advocacy and Market Awareness

A corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience interviewing and hiring thousands of people ranks various job search methods based on their effectiveness for quickly landing a job and maximizing return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. The rankings are subjective, from 1 (least effective) to 10 (most effective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>.

## Less Effective Networking Methods

### Cold Calling (1/10)
Cold calling involves soliciting a job without knowing if the employer has an opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. This includes:
*   Calling a company switchboard to inquire about jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.
*   Dropping in unannounced to fill out an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   Sending unsolicited notes on [[Networking and Building Connections on LinkedIn | LinkedIn]] asking for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

As a corporate recruiter, cold calling almost never works and is a poor use of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:08">[02:15:08]</a>.

### Social Media Engagement (1/10)
Engaging with a company's social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, [[Networking and Building Connections on LinkedIn | LinkedIn]]) with the aim of being noticed by a hiring team is highly ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>. HR and talent acquisition typically do not manage social media; it's usually handled by marketing departments, especially in larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. Recruiters are unlikely to see engagement on product posts, making it akin to cold calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Job Fairs (2/10)
Job fairs can be effective for blue-collar roles or entry-level university students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">[04:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. However, from an employer's perspective, finding highly qualified candidates is rare, and competition among job seekers is stiff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. For job seekers, it's often like "window shopping" and not a targeted way to look for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Industry Events / In-Person Networking (3/10)
Similar to job fairs, these are often untargeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. It can be awkward to mingle, and the chances of finding a relevant job opening are slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. While it can lead to long-term contacts, it's not ideal for quickly finding a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This method can also be challenging for introverts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.

### Online Forums (3/10)
Online forums, including some [[Networking and Building Connections on LinkedIn | LinkedIn]] groups, offer [[Networking and skill enhancement during unemployment | networking and skill enhancement]] opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. However, they are generally not targeted for active job seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. When a job is mentioned, it can quickly turn into a "feeding frenzy" with many applicants vying for the same opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. While recruiters may use these forums to find candidates with demonstrated expertise in niche areas, building up a knowledge repository in a forum isn't the most efficient way to get a job quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

### Professional Associations (4/10)
Joining professional associations, like the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), allows you to be surrounded by people in your specific industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Getting involved in committees or becoming an expert can help brand yourself in a local labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This method is generally more geared towards white-collar professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### Company Websites (5/10)
Applying directly on a company's website ensures your resume is seen by the recruiter, as it filters directly into their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This can be slightly more effective than applying through an external [[Effective use of job boards | job board]], where applications might not automatically transfer to the ATS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

### Headhunters / Agencies (5/10)
Headhunters or agencies are third parties contracted by employers to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. They often work with multiple employers on various roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. While they might offer a few relevant positions, the engagement tends to fizzle out if you're not a fit for the primary role they considered you for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. It's advisable to use agencies as a supplement to your job search, not as the sole method, and always take ownership of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

### Personal Website / Blog (5/10)
Creating a personal website or blog allows you to brand yourself as an expert and showcase a portfolio of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. This is particularly powerful and often necessary for creative roles (e.g., design, motion, photography) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. Writing niche content can attract companies interested in your expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. While surprisingly easy to set up, this is a longer-term strategy and not for immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

### Job Boards (6/10)
Using [[Effective use of job boards | job boards]] like [[Using LinkedIn strategically for job searching | LinkedIn]] or Indeed to find and apply for jobs is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. The main challenge is the high competition, often with thousands of applicants for a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Recruiters often source candidates through other methods, and active job postings only account for 5-10% of filled jobs due to misaligned candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. Despite the effort and low payout, it only takes one offer to get re-employed, so it's still worth doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

## More Effective Networking Methods

### Online Networking (7/10)
Targeted online networking, particularly through [[Using LinkedIn strategically for job searching | LinkedIn]], is a powerful job search method if done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Avoid cold-calling-like behavior, such as blasting unsolicited connection requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. A specific course on [[Networking and Building Connections on LinkedIn | Unlocking LinkedIn]] offers detailed etiquette and strategies for effective online networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

### Advertisements (7/10)
Responding to "Help Wanted" signs, billboards, or vehicle advertisements can be highly effective, especially for blue-collar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. These advertisements often indicate a company is struggling to find qualified applicants, increasing your chances of being seen if you are a decent fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. Major corporations typically don't use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.

### Internships / Co-ops (7/10)
For entry-level job seekers, internships and co-ops are probably the most powerful way to land a first job, especially without prior relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. They provide a significant advantage over competitors, offer a foot in the door at an organization, and allow you to build goodwill with hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.

### Industry Contacts (8/10)
[[Networking and accessing the hidden job market | Networking]] with industry contacts, especially former bosses or close colleagues who are now in higher positions at other organizations, is a very powerful way to get a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. These contacts can often pull you into their new company, reducing the need for a deep interview process and often ensuring a fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>. It's crucial to stay close with influential people in your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

### Employee Referrals (8/10)
If you know someone working at a company you're interested in, reaching out for an employee referral is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. Employees often receive a bonus for successful referrals, and referred candidates almost always get preference over external applicants, often skipping to the front of the line for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. This method is absolutely worth the effort to cultivate those networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.

### Outbound Sourcing / Discoverability (10/10)
This is the most effective method, as it's how most recruiters (80% or more) fill their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. Outbound sourcing involves recruiters actively searching for candidates who closely match job profiles, often by perusing [[Using LinkedIn strategically for job searching | LinkedIn]] and other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. If a recruiter finds you, you are pulled directly to the front of the line, bypassing the extensive application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. Making yourself discoverable for desired job types is the single best thing you can do for your active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

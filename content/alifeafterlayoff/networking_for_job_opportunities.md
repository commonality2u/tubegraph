[[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | Networking]] is a crucial component in navigating career growth and securing new opportunities. It's recommended to actively engage in job searching and market testing at least once every two years, even when satisfied with your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This proactive approach helps prevent complacency and ensures that your career progression and compensation remain competitive with the evolving market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Why Networking is Essential
Acting as the CEO of your own career means constantly monitoring the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Staying in a job for too long without exploring external opportunities can lead to the market passing you by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

<p class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</p>
> One of the most important components is making sure that you have a solid [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | Network]] because a lot of these great opportunities are going to come through active and targeted [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | networking]] and not through applying for jobs.

It is significantly easier to secure a job when you have individuals actively recruiting and advocating for you, rather than solely relying on convincing a recruiter with your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective Networking
To keep abreast of market trends and ensure your compensation aligns with industry standards, it's advised to regularly test the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>:
*   **Apply for jobs** to gauge current demand and requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Connect with recruiters** in your field to understand the landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Go through interview processes** to assess the skills companies are seeking and how they evaluate candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reach the offer stage** to accurately determine if you are underpaid relative to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

This process helps you understand where the market is trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. For instance, new talent entering the market often receives significant raises (10-20%), while internal promotions may only see 5-10% bumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Relying solely on small incremental cost-of-living adjustments can lead to wage stagnation and being significantly underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Your Network: An Example
An individual who had been with their employer for 7-8 years, despite being a top performer and having received promotions, found themselves in a department with high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Through their [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | network]], they secured a couple of job opportunities and went through the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This led to an offer of $5 more per hour than their current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Upon informing their current employer of their intent to leave, they received a counter-offer of a $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

This example illustrates that employers often wait until an employee is on the verge of leaving to offer competitive compensation, highlighting potential underpayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Testing the market via [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | networking]] can reveal such discrepancies and empower you to negotiate better terms or find more equitable opportunities.

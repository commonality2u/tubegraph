Your resume serves as the crucial first impression you make on recruiters and hiring teams, especially in a competitive job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. To ensure you stand out from the crowd, it's vital to have a clean, concise, and well-crafted document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This article outlines common mistakes to avoid, enhancing your [[strategies_for_improving_job_applications_and_career_control | job application strategies]] and overall [[strategies_for_improving_job_search_success | job search success]].

## Presentation and Design

When crafting your resume, the visual presentation should prioritize professionalism and clarity to avoid [[common_mistakes_in_resume_writing | common mistakes in resume writing]].

### Avoid Bright Graphics or Colors
While some color is acceptable (e.g., a job title in a different color) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, stick to simple hues like blues, blacks, or possibly magenta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The goal is to maintain cleanliness and conciseness, avoiding distractions for the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Limit Graphs, Charts, and Clip Art
Your resume is a professional document, and excessive "colorful stuff" can lead to negative judgment, even if you intend for it to show personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The only exception is if you are in a creative field, such as an art director or graphic designer, where showing creativity through such elements is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For most other careers, keep it simple and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Steer Clear of Skill Infographics
Using infographics to demonstrate skill proficiency, such as progress bars, can inadvertently highlight weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If you rate yourself low on a skill, you might eliminate yourself from consideration without realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It's better to allow the assessment of skills to occur during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### No Multiple Columns
Multiple columns can cause issues with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which often parse left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. An ATS might only read the first column, making other listed skills invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This can prevent you from being discovered through keyword searches by recruiters later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. To ensure maximum discoverability, avoid columns altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Personal Information Considerations

Be mindful of the personal information you include, as it can inadvertently lead to discrimination or misinterpretation.

### Avoid Photographs (U.S. Specific)
In the U.S. and North America (including Mexico to an extent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, including a photograph can lead recruiters to assume you are not based in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Only include a photo if it's customary in the country you are applying in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Omit Personal Identifiers
Do not include information about your gender, race, creed, color, or marital status (e.g., married with two kids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This is crucial for avoiding decisions based on non-work-related factors that could be used against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. In the U.S., these are protected classes, and including them gives an employer "low-hanging fruit" for discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Use Professional Email Addresses
Avoid unprofessional or outdated email addresses (e.g., "partyboy28@yahoo.com") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Create a clean, neutral email using your full name or a moniker, ideally a Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This prevents hiring managers from making negative assumptions about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Don't Include Full Addresses
Only provide your city and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Recruiters do not need your street address and will not send mail or visit your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Including a full address can lead to discrimination based on perceived commute distance, even if you deem it reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

*   **Note for Remote Workers**: Even for remote positions, still include your city and state. Recruiters need this for time zone considerations and to confirm if the company is legally set up to do business and handle taxation in your specific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is particularly important for international applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Content and Experience

Focus on relevant, clear, and impactful content to effectively showcase your qualifications.

### Exclude Irrelevant or Outdated Work History
Generally, employers focus on the last 10 years of your work history, and often more recently, the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Skills older than 10 years are often no longer relevant due to market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Only include extensive history if the job specifically requires 20+ years of experience, typically for senior executive roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This helps to [[how_to_make_resumes_concise_and_relevant | make resumes concise and relevant]].

### Avoid Industry-Specific Jargon and Acronyms
Do not use job titles or acronyms that are only understood within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. If a recruiter or hiring manager outside your company wouldn't understand it, it hinders your discoverability and forces them to work harder to understand your experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Be Concise with Education Details
Avoid excessive detail about your degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Simply state the university name and degree type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Minor degrees are generally not heavily weighted by employers, so don't dedicate significant space to them, unless you are entry-level and need the keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### GPA and Internships (Entry-Level Only)
If you are more than three years out of college, remove your GPA from your resume, as employers typically don't care about it at that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Similarly, if you have been in the workforce for more than three years, remove internships, as they are not counted towards total years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Don't List References or "References Available Upon Request"
It is assumed that references are available if requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Employers are increasingly moving away from checking references, with some only doing so about 5% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Never Include Salary History
Do not list your previous salary history or expected compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Disclosing this information can lead to a lowball offer if the employer sees they can get you for less than their potential budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Salary discussions will typically occur in the first interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Skills and Language

Strategic use of language and skill descriptions can significantly impact how your resume is perceived.

### Avoid Universal or Generic Skills
Skills like "Microsoft Word," "Excel," or "PowerPoint" are industry standards assumed for most professional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Save valuable resume space for more specific and impactful skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Similarly, "leadership" and "organization skills" are better demonstrated through bullet points describing your achievements rather than listed as standalone skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Eliminate Cliche Jargon
Avoid generic and cliche phrases like "team player" or "fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. These phrases are unoriginal and do not provide any valuable insight into your abilities, as no one would admit to not possessing these qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Use your resume's real estate for more meaningful and descriptive content.

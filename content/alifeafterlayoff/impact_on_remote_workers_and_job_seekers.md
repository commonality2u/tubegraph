Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has declared the end of remote work for the company, following similar moves by other major tech companies such as Google and Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These companies assert that remote work no longer aligns with their business models and is a thing of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This decision marks a significant shift, prompting questions about which other companies might follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## [[amazon_ending_remote_work | Amazon Ending Remote Work]]: The Memo's Justification

In his memo, Jassy outlined changes aimed at strengthening Amazon's culture and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He cited Amazon's core values, including customer focus, collaboration, inventiveness, long-term perspective, ownership, speed in decision-making, and a lack of bureaucracy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. He characterized Amazon as operating like the "world's largest startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, emphasizing a passion for inventing, urgency, high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness, frugality, and deeply connected collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Jassy identified two areas for improvement: organizational structure for ownership and speed, and the ability to invent, collaborate, and connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Organizational Structure Changes

To address the first point, Amazon plans to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The goal is to remove layers, flatten organizations, and increase teams' ability to move faster with clarity, invigorating their sense of ownership and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

However, this move raises concerns:
*   Many current middle managers will likely face layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   The speaker suggests that higher-level management, not middle managers, often contribute to bureaucracy and slow decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Individual contributors aspiring to management roles may find their career paths derailed due to fewer opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Return to Office Mandate

To address the second point — improving invention, collaboration, and connection — Amazon has decided to return to being in the office as it was before the onset of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The company believes the advantages of in-office presence are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

The speaker notes that while in-office work can offer benefits, especially for those early in their careers to learn corporate politics and find mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, this mandate is problematic. Many employees were told they could work effectively remotely during the pandemic, adjusting their lifestyles, moving away from cities, and setting up home offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Most employees proved highly productive remotely, benefiting from no commutes and more family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The speaker criticizes the return-to-office edicts as "corporate gaslighting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, giving employees little time to react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Employees who moved or were hired remotely now face difficult decisions: relocate to costly cities or resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Furthermore, the rationale for collaboration is questioned, as many teams remain geographically distributed, leading to continued virtual meetings even from the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

> [00:12:00] We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently 5 days a week will require some adjustment.
> [00:12:00] **Speaker's commentary**: This statement minimizes the significant [[impact_on_job_seekers | impact on employees]] and suggests a lack of understanding for the complexity of their situations.

## [[impact_on_job_seekers | Impact on Job Seekers]] and Current Remote Workers

This change is not good news for those currently working remotely, particularly the unemployed seeking coveted remote positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. A significant number of talented and credentialed individuals from Amazon and other companies are expected to enter the job market, increasing competition for remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

Remote jobs are becoming increasingly rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> and will be extremely competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This means job seekers must adjust their strategies and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Strategies for [[job_market_competition_and_strategies_for_remote_positions | Job Market Competition and Strategies for Remote Positions]]

To succeed in this competitive environment, job seekers need to:
*   **Differentiate themselves**: Those with average skill sets will struggle to land remote jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Improve candidacy**: Identify employer demands from job postings and take steps to become a better candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Enhance marketing presentation**: Optimize resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Target the right employers**: Focus on companies that still value remote arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

> [00:13:06] If you're looking for a remote-first job unfortunately I think you need to start facing the reality that it's not nearly as common as it was before.
> [00:13:06] **Note**: While the landscape for remote jobs is changing, employers still exist who value remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

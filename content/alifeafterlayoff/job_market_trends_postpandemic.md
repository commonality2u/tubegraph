The job market has seen significant shifts and new trends emerge in the years following the 2020 economic downturn, leading to the latest concept of "career cushioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding these trends provides context for current [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | employment trends]] and proactive career management strategies.

## Recent Job Market Trends: A Timeline

Since the major [[impact_of_economic_changes_on_job_market | economic downturn]] of 2020 due to the pandemic, several distinct [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | employment trends]] have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### The Pandemic's Initial Impact (2020)
In 2020, a significant [[impact_of_economic_changes_on_job_market | economic downturn]] resulted from the pandemic, leading many employers to lay off employees in what was perceived as a knee-jerk reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
The remaining workforce faced increased burdens and long hours, under a pervasive mantra of "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Employers demanded more while cutting expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This period caused significant burnout and prompted individuals to re-evaluate their career and life priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### The Great Resignation
Following the burnout, the "great resignation wave" began, with many articles and discussions about employees quitting their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This period marked a significant shift where the power pendulum swung away from employers towards job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
During this "Heyday of job seeking," opportunities were abundant, people received raises, and many left stable jobs for more lucrative or appealing positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Quiet Quitting
For those who didn't leave their jobs but were burned out, "quiet quitting" emerged as an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This trend involved employees doing the bare minimum required for their job without officially resigning, as the risk of backlash was low due to the high demand for labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Quiet Firing
As the job market pendulum began to swing back towards employers, "quiet firing" became a phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This involves employers creating conditions to encourage employees to quit rather than outright firing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Current State of the Job Market (December 2022)

As of December 2022, the [[state_of_the_current_job_market | job market is shaky]] and increasingly uncertain, with the pendulum appearing to swing more towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

While the overall [[state_of_the_current_job_market | labor market]] still shows signs of strength, specific industries, particularly [[tech_layoffs_and_job_market_challenges | tech]], have been significantly impacted by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This trend of layoffs is expected to potentially spread to other parts of the economy in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives revealed that 50% of respondents are reducing their overall headcount, even while expressing concerns about hiring and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This indicates that companies are "right-sizing" after potentially over-hiring during the boom period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Current market indicators include:
*   Hiring freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
*   Reduced overall headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   Lowering or dropping of sign-on bonuses and perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>
*   44% of companies rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>

## Career Cushioning: The Latest Trend

Against this backdrop of [[challenges_in_the_job_market | job market challenges]], "career cushioning" is the latest [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | employment trend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

> "Career cushioning essentially says that you should be planning proactively by cushioning the possibility of losing your job." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>

This proactive approach can involve various activities:
*   Updating your LinkedIn profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   Updating your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   Researching current job postings to understand employer demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>
*   Actively building professional networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   Applying to jobs or reaching out to recruiters for "soft feelers," without necessarily being in an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>

Career cushioning is about creating a "safety net" to land softer in case of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. While the speaker notes it's not a new concept, it's a label for the ongoing practice of acting like a "free agent" in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. It's an ongoing, consistent process, not a one-time activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Should You Practice Career Cushioning?
The answer is "100% yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It is crucial to act like a free agent and take proactive steps to set yourself up for success in the event of an unplanned income disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This ensures you control your career trajectory and are not caught off guard by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

#### Practical Steps for Career Cushioning:
1.  **Update and Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile**: Ensure your profile is optimized and appealing to recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
2.  **Build Active Networks on LinkedIn**: Connect with people who can potentially assist your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  **Keep Your Resume Current**: Avoid scrambling to update it during a stressful layoff notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
4.  **Evaluate Career Desires and Skill Gaps**: Take stock of what you truly want in your career, assess your current skills, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This proactive planning while employed reduces stress and helps align with your core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

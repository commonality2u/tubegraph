The modern job market has seen significant shifts, making job searching more challenging than in previous years, partly due to the increasing influence of [[Impact of AI on jobs | artificial intelligence]] (AI) in hiring processes [00:00:04]. Companies are actively exploring how [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] will affect their workforce and are even looking to replace workers with [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] [00:07:13]. This has led to a cautious approach to hiring, with employers delaying decisions as they assess the economic landscape and the potential of [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] [00:06:58].

## AI's Impact on Hiring Practices

### Automation and Impersonal Processes
As companies reduce their recruiting staff, they are increasingly turning to [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] to automate processes out of necessity [00:08:15]. This means that job seekers are likely to encounter [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] more frequently throughout the application process [00:08:29]. The automation leads to a more impersonal experience, often resulting in more rejections due to the binary nature of [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] filtering [00:08:34]. [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] systems typically operate on a black-and-white basis, either matching criteria or not, leaving no room for human interpretation [00:08:40].

### Lack of Human Interpretation and Potential Bias
A significant challenge with [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] in hiring is its lack of human interpretation [00:09:09]. For individuals looking to transition into a new industry or job type, human recruiters often provide the opportunity for a nuanced understanding of their skill set, seeing potential that may not be immediately obvious [00:09:09]. [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] systems, however, simply filter based on pre-set criteria [00:09:20].

Furthermore, while some might believe [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] eliminates biases, Amazon's experience has shown this is not necessarily true [00:08:52].

### AI in Interviews and Screening
[[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] is not only used for initial application screening but is also making its way into the interview process itself [00:11:55]. Job seekers might find themselves interviewing with a "robot" for first-round interviews, or engaging in one-way video interviews where they speak to a camera without a person on the other side [00:12:05]. These video responses are then assessed, potentially by an [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] system that searches for specific keywords [00:12:49]. This impersonal approach means job seekers may not interact with a human until later stages of the interview process, making it difficult to receive direct feedback [00:13:00].

## Challenges for Job Seekers

The increased reliance on [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]], combined with higher competition, means there are fewer "decent jobs" and more people vying for them [00:13:16]. LinkedIn research indicates that the average job seeker applies to 40% more jobs today than a year ago, facing more rejections despite increased effort [00:13:26]. This environment can be incredibly frustrating and disheartening for those seeking employment [00:13:48].

## Strategies for Job Seekers

To navigate this landscape, job seekers need to gain a competitive advantage [00:18:18]. This includes learning to write compelling resumes that can cut through the high volume of applications and bypass [[Impact of AI on jobs | AI]] filters [00:14:40]. It is also crucial to develop strong interviewing skills to stand out from a larger pool of candidates [00:16:16]. Ideally, job seekers should optimize their online presence, such as on LinkedIn, to attract recruiters and potentially bypass automated screening processes [00:17:15].

Building and maintaining trust and credibility are crucial for career progression and [[handling_workplace_professionalism | professionalism]] in any work environment. Missteps, even seemingly innocent ones, can lead to significant issues with colleagues and leadership, potentially stunting long-term career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## The Cost of Over-Sharing: A Cautionary Tale

An HR professional recounts a personal experience early in their career that highlighted the importance of discretion. While working as an HR Generalist in a manufacturing and global engineering company, they were often nomadic, rotating through different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

In a small town, they were responsible for staffing and employee relations for two facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. They developed a rapport with a line worker their age, eventually considering him a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. One weekend, they joined this co-worker and his friends at a local bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Inevitably, the conversation turned to work, and the co-worker asked about the new supervisor, Joe, who was inexperienced in his first leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The HR professional made an "innocent" comment, stating Joe was "still growing" in his new role and they were "helping him with some things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The following week, the HR professional's boss received a call from an upset Joe, who claimed they were "spreading rumors" about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It turned out the co-worker had immediately reported the comment to Joe, twisting it to suggest a lack of faith in his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This incident led to a necessary apology and repair of the relationship with Joe, emphasizing the need for extreme caution when choosing friends at work and what to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Maintaining Professional Credibility

### Over-Sharing
Even seemingly innocent comments made while over-sharing can find their way back to management, leading to a major credibility issue and potentially stunting career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Gossiping
Office gossips are easily identifiable and can often be found congregating in common areas like the lunchroom or water cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Engaging in "water cooler talk" with people who stir up drama and gossip carries a high risk of over-sharing or saying something regrettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Associating with gossips can brand you as one, hindering [[loyalty_and_its_impact_on_career_progression | upward career mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It's advisable to get what you need and leave, avoiding getting "sucked into the drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Office gossips are frequently implicated in employee relations issues and tend to be negative, potentially dragging down those they associate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Negative Influences
Avoid spending too much time with negative colleagues who constantly complain about the boss, company, or pay, as their mindset can inevitably bring you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Such negativity can be a "cancer" in a group, especially for individuals focused on [[loyalty_and_its_impact_on_career_progression | upward mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Workplace Competition and Jealousy
Friendships at work can become competitive when promotion opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. If you are promoted over a friend, the dynamic can become awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A former co-worker who knows "dirty secrets" from past interactions could potentially compromise you if you become their supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Jealousy from colleagues about your progression can also hold you back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Socializing Outside of Work
Be especially cautious at events like happy hours or other off-hours gatherings with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Alcohol can lead to "loose lips" and inappropriate behavior, blurring the line between chummy interactions and harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. An off-color joke, for example, could offend someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. A key principle in HR is that "anything you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

While it's possible to [[building_relationships_at_work | build relationships]] and have friends at work, it's essential to [[managing_workplace_relationships | pick and choose your friends very carefully]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Always be cautious about your behavior, what you say, and what you share to maintain [[challenges_of_workplace_relationships_and_professional_boundaries | professional boundaries]] and protect your credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

When facing a difficult job search, the temptation to "flub things a little bit" on a resume to stand out can be strong, but it's important to understand the potential [[consequences_of_lying_during_the_hiring_process | consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, the advice is to always strive to be hired on your merits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

While some minor "white lies" might be considered acceptable by some to optimize the chances of being noticed by a recruiter, such as manipulating job titles to match common market terms or listing a primary client company instead of a third-party contractor if you are fully integrated into their team, there are definite limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The application form submitted to a company is a legal document, and falsification can lead to severe repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Information You Should NEVER Lie About

Lying on a job application can lead to serious [[consequences_of_lying_during_the_hiring_process | consequences]], including termination or rescinded job offers, as it constitutes falsification of an official document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Employers

Do not lie about never having worked for a particular company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. While it may be acceptable to list a "name brand" client company if you were a contractor fully embedded within their team, had their email address, and reported to their boss, fabricating an employer entirely will likely be exposed during the interviewing process and lead to no offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### References

Never ask a friend to pretend to be a previous boss or provide false references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. It's better to honestly explain any difficult relationships with former supervisors and find alternative professional contacts who can serve as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Specific Employment Dates

While it might be acceptable to use only years (e.g., 2017-2020) to make a resume appear cleaner, especially if there's job hopping, do not lie about specific dates of employment or add extra years to your tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. If directly asked about specific start and end dates, honesty is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Fabricating dates is a direct falsification that will likely be discovered during background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Difficult-to-Acquire Skills

Do not lie about possessing major skill sets, such as complex computer programming languages, that you do not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. While it may be acceptable to claim proficiency in easily learned skills (e.g., a common software program like Google Docs if you're familiar with Microsoft Word, provided you can learn it quickly), fabricating advanced skills will expose you during interviews or once you start the job, setting you up for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Education

Never lie about having a degree or certification you don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Recruiters will verify educational claims directly with institutions during background checks, and falsifying a degree will result in the job offer being rescinded and you being blacklisted from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

### Criminal Record

If asked directly about a criminal record, such as a felony, do not omit or lie about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Background checks will expose this information. It is better to be honest and provide a sincere explanation than to lie, which will definitively cost you the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Years of Experience

Do not inflate your years of experience to meet job requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Lying about significant experience will be evident during the interview process, and even if you somehow secure the job, you will be set up to fail because the role expects someone with that level of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. It's more beneficial for your career to seek positions appropriate for your actual experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

When assessing a new job offer, it's crucial to evaluate not just the company, but also the person you'll be reporting to directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Observing your potential boss for certain [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flags]] can help you avoid a problematic work situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Signs of a Disengaged or Problematic Boss

Pay close attention if your prospective boss exhibits any of the following during the interview process or company visits:

*   **Lack of Engagement or Distraction** They might seem "not quite there," distracted, or even show up late to the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Ideally, you want to feel the same level of excitement from your boss that you feel about starting a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Complaining Behavior** If they complain about their current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, the person previously in the role you're applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, or other co-workers in their department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, it's a significant indicator of potential trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### High Turnover in the Department or Company

A major [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flag]] is if there's high turnover within the department you're joining or the broader company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Even worse, if your direct manager is in the process of leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, this can be problematic. Accepting an offer based on excitement for a particular [[analyzing_leadership_styles_in_potential_employers | management style]] only to find a different boss on day one could be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

It's essential to ask tough questions during the interview about turnover rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. If the hiring manager is the primary reason for people leaving, you might find yourself needing to update your resume again in a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Negative Peer Feedback

During facility visits or meetings with potential co-workers, listen carefully to their dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Strange or derogatory comments, such as jokes about "walking into a gauntlet" or calling you a "brave soul" for working with a particular boss, are [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Consider requesting one-on-one meetings with potential peers and ask questions like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>:
*   "What do you like about working here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   "How is this boss to work with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   "How would you describe the corporate culture?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>

This "water cooler talk" can reveal underlying issues with the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Understanding Why the Position is Open

Always ask the hiring manager why the position is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

*   **Termination for Cause** If the previous employee was terminated for cause, understanding the reasons can offer insights into the hiring manager's expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It can also inform you what you would need to do differently to succeed in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **"Confidential" Postings** Be very wary of jobs posted as "confidential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This often means the organization is replacing someone who doesn't know they're being replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. While there can be valid business reasons, such as an employee not improving despite ample opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, it can raise concerns about job stability and whether employees are given a chance to [[proactive_steps_to_address_job_performance_concerns | correct performance behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

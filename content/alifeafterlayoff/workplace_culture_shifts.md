The modern workforce is experiencing a significant transformation, marked by the rise of "quiet quitting" and the "coasting culture." This shift is seen as an extension of the [[changes_in_corporate_loyalty_and_employment_practices | Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?

Quiet quitting is the act of effectively quitting a job without physically leaving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. It involves reducing one's output to the minimum acceptable standard required for the job, doing "just enough to get by" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This means employees are not taking on extra tasks, burdens, or working beyond their core responsibilities, thus relieving themselves of additional stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

It's crucial to note that while discussing this concept, the speaker does not advocate for being lazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, but rather seeks to explain a legitimate phenomenon gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Emergence of Coasting Culture

The [[Impact of workplace culture and politics on job satisfaction | coasting culture]] has emerged as a response to years of intense work demands and a re-evaluation of priorities, especially influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Reasons for the Shift
*   **Re-evaluation of Work's Role**: During the pandemic, many professionals began to see work simply as a source of income to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding their utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Ideal Conditions**: A hot labor market provided job security, and the rise of [[shift_towards_hybrid_work_models | remote work]] made it harder for managers to monitor employees' effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Rejection of "Hustle Culture"**: Employees grew tired of companies "squeezing free labor" out of them, enduring late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This new approach is seen as a "secret resistance against the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, replacing the "hustle culture" in some corporate sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Burnout from Increased Workload**: Following widespread layoffs in 2020, remaining employees were often left to pick up the slack, leading to significant burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Historical Context and Market Pendulum

Historically, the employment market pendulum swung heavily towards employers, who treated employees as "human resources" to be exploited for maximum productivity at minimum cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This fostered a "hustle culture" where employees felt compelled to work long hours, take on extra tasks, and remain constantly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

There has been a repeating cycle over decades where companies would grow "bloated," leading to catastrophic events (e.g., 9/11, the 2008 subprime crisis) that enabled mass layoffs, allowing companies to become "leaner" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The pandemic period around 2020 presented an "opportune time" for companies to make "ruthless cuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. However, many cut "too big, too deep," which "fractured the workforce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. As demand "came screaming back," companies found themselves understaffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This led to a "deep sense of betrayal" among employees who had dedicated years to the "hustle culture," only to be laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

This period represents a "seismic shift in the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, marking the first significant shift towards employees since the 1930s with the Fair Labor Standards Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Generational and Cultural Factors

The shift is also influenced by generational changes:
*   [[changes_in_corporate_loyalty_and_employment_practices | Baby boomers]] are exiting the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Generation Z is entering with a "completely different" mentality towards the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The days of being loyal to a company for 20 years are considered "antiquated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, and long tenure can even be "looked down upon" in some circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Employees who stay too long may also fall behind on the employment curve and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Implications for Companies

Companies are now "forced to reevaluate how they approach the work world and how they treat their employees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Employees are establishing "employment boundaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, refusing to be overloaded with work, work long hours, or work on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

This new dynamic means employers must "start re-evaluating how they treat their employees" because "employers behaving badly got away with it" for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. With difficulties in backfilling positions, employers may view "some output is better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> from quiet quitters.

## Employee Perspective: Work-Life Balance

The core mindset shift for employees is from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Employees no longer see their "company's not my family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> and are unwilling to tolerate the grueling hours they previously accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. After "decades leaning in," many are now "deciding to lean back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a> to reclaim work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Recommendations

While quiet quitting is a phenomenon, the speaker suggests that a better approach for unhappy employees is to "keep your resume up to date and strategically plan your exit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. However, for those with built-up equity, vacation time, or 401ks, quiet quitting can be an option to reduce workload to the minimum acceptable output while maintaining employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

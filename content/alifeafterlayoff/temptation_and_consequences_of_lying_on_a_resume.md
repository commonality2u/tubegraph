In a difficult job search, the temptation to falsify information on a resume to gain an advantage can be strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While outright lying is generally not condoned, there are nuances in how a resume can be optimized to attract a recruiter's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. As a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, the primary goal of a resume is to secure an initial phone call, as recruiters often give resumes only a five-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Optimizing Your Resume (White Lies)

Rather than fabricating information, some "white lies" or manipulations are considered acceptable to position oneself more advantageously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>:

### Job Titles
If your current or past job title is proprietary and different from a more common market term for the same role, it is acceptable to change it on your resume to match what companies are searching for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This increases discoverability and likelihood of being noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Employer
If you work in a contracting position through a third-party agency but exclusively support a specific, well-known company, it may be acceptable to list the name-brand company as your employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This applies if you were part of their team, used their email, and your direct boss was from the main company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. However, be prepared to explain the contractual nature of the role during later stages, especially during background checks, to avoid hiccups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Location
If you are actively planning to move to a new location, listing your address as being in that target area might help you receive more calls from local recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. However, be fully prepared to move yourself without relocation assistance, as springing this on a company during the offer process could be unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It could also lead to losing out on potential relocation compensation if the company originally had an appetite to relocate candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Dates of Employment
Instead of specific months and years, listing only the years of employment can subtly "massage" your resume to appear cleaner, especially if you have instances of job hopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This is about making it generic and not broadcasting specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. If asked directly about specific dates during an interview, always be honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Skills
If a job description lists "preferred" skills that are common, easily learnable, and can be acquired quickly (e.g., within an hour or two), it might be acceptable to claim proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The key is to be able to genuinely demonstrate the skill by the time you start the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Reasons for Leaving a Position
While it's not advised to outright lie about being fired, laid off, or quitting, you don't necessarily need to advertise it on your resume or application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Omitting the reason or stating "better opportunity" can prevent automatic rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. If directly asked in an interview, be honest and prepared with a truthful explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

The application form itself is a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Falsifying information is a terminable offense and can lead to job offers being rescinded or even termination if discovered after hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It's crucial to understand the [[consequences_of_inconsistencies_and_dishonesty_in_resumes | consequences of inconsistencies and dishonesty in resumes]].

Do not lie about the following:

### Company History
Never claim to have worked for a company you've never been employed by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This will inevitably be exposed during the interview or background check process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### References
Do not ask a friend to pretend to be a former boss or colleague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. It is better to honestly explain any poor past relationships with a supervisor and provide an alternative, truthful reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Specific Dates of Employment
While vague years might be acceptable, do not add extra years to your employment history or claim to be currently working if you are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This is outright falsification and will be caught during background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

### Major Skills
Avoid lying about critical skills that are difficult or time-consuming to acquire, especially technical or programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This will lead to exposure during interviews and likely lead to failure in the role if hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### Education
Never falsify degrees, certifications, or educational institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Educational claims are always verified during background checks, and lying will result in a lost offer and blacklisting from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Criminal Record
Do not omit or lie about a criminal record, especially a felony, if specifically asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Background checks will reveal this information, and honesty is the best approach, as lying guarantees job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

### Years of Experience
Exaggerating your years of experience to meet a job requirement (e.g., claiming five years when you only have two) will likely lead to exposure during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Even if you get hired, you will be set up to fail as the company expects a higher level of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. It is better to find a role appropriate for your actual experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

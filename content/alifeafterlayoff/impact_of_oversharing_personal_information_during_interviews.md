When heading into a job interview, it's crucial to make a strong impression and avoid [[common_interview_mistakes | common interview mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key aspect of this is understanding what [[information_to_avoid_revealing_in_a_job_interview | information to avoid revealing in your interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Oversharing personal information can be detrimental, as interviewing can feel like "navigating a Minefield" where one wrong step can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Why Oversharing Occurs

Oversharing too many personal facts is often a symptom of nervousness or being long-winded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Neither of these traits are ideal for impressing an interview team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Being long-winded can also indicate a lack of [[effective_communication_during_interviews | emotional intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Negative Impacts of Oversharing

### Perceived Communication Issues
Employers often link a candidate's ability to articulate themselves during an interview to how they would perform in a business setting or meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. If you're long-winded, interviewers may conclude that you cannot convey thoughts clearly and concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Interview answers should generally be limited to two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Bias Formation
Sharing too much personal information can lead the interviewer to develop a bias, either for or against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For instance, revealing a hobby that the interviewer doesn't appreciate could result in them judging you negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It's generally best to keep discussions strictly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Reasons for Leaving a Previous Employer
While honesty is important, you might not want to reveal the *entire* truth about why you're leaving a current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This includes escaping a boring employer, disliking a boss, or feeling poorly treated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

*   **Perception of Difficulty:** If you state you disliked your boss, an employer might perceive you as difficult to work with or a potential problem, which can be a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Lack of Initiative:** Saying a job didn't challenge you might lead an employer to conclude you lack initiative to seek out more enriching work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

It is advisable to articulate your reasons for leaving in a way that is not threatening to a prospective employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Future Career Plans
Oversharing career plans can also backfire, particularly when asked "Where do you see yourself in five years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Lack of Commitment:** Stating plans to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely after five years is generally viewed negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It suggests you're not passionate about the work you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Conveying Passion:** It's essential to convey a level of passion for the role to a hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Desperation
Never reveal that you're interviewing out of desperation, even if you're urgently seeking employment due to layoff or termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. An employer will perceive this desperation, and it can push the desired outcome further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. You must convey calmness and composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Age and Career Longevity
Be careful not to inadvertently reveal your age or how many years you have left in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Both being "too young" or "too old" can lead to age discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

*   **Subtle Clues:** Be mindful of dates on your resume, email addresses, and even outdated technologies (like a fax number on a resume) that could indicate your age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Retirement Plans:** Explicitly stating plans to work only a few more years can create a bias, especially if the hiring manager expects someone for a long-term role or growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Recruiters should not know this information, as it can become a liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Medical Issues and Disabilities
Generally, do not reveal major medical issues during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

*   **Basic Requirements:** Employers have the right to know if a medical issue prohibits you from meeting basic job requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This is typically addressed during the application process or by the recruiter asking if you can meet job description requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Protected Characteristics:** Employers cannot refuse to hire someone because they are pregnant or have a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. If a disability does not interfere with job performance, it's best not to bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Reasonable Accommodation:** If a reasonable accommodation is required, it should be indicated in the application or brought up at the time of an offer, not during the interview itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. You are hired for your ability to perform the job based on the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Political Belief System
It is advisable to avoid revealing your political belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The political spectrum is wide and often heated, and you never know the interviewer's viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Previous Salary
Do not reveal your previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This question typically arises during the recruiter phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Locking In a Lower Salary:** Disclosing your previous salary can lock you into a lower offer than you might otherwise receive, especially if you were underpaid compared to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Determining Your Worth:** You, as the employee, should determine your worth based on the open market for your skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities, not allow an employer to determine your value based on past earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

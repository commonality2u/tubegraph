It is crucial for individuals to regularly assess their market value, even when satisfied with their current role, as companies often lag behind market compensation trends [00:00:24]. Acting as the CEO of one's career or as a free agent means consistently monitoring the job market to understand its current state and avoid being passed by in terms of career progression and compensation [00:01:09].

## The Anecdotal Case of Underpayment and Retention
A professional in the medical field, a top performer with 7-8 years at their employer and multiple promotions, found themselves in a department experiencing nearly 100% turnover in 18 months [00:01:25]. Given the high demand for their skills, finding another position was not difficult [00:01:46].

After interviewing externally, they received an offer for five dollars more per hour, although it came with a longer commute [00:02:17]. Upon informing their current employer of their intent to leave, the employer offered a significant 15-dollar-per-hour raise [00:02:34]. The company's reasoning was a desire to retain staff due to high departmental turnover [00:02:44].

This situation raises questions about [[employer_hiring_strategies_and_ethics | corporate practices and employee loyalty]]:
> "Why does it seem like employers wait around till people are literally leaving the department tendering their resignation in order to do the right thing and pay people properly?" [00:02:51]

It also prompts inquiry into whether the employee was significantly underpaid to begin with, or if the company was genuinely trying to retain talent in a tight labor market where employees are no longer tolerating underpayment [00:03:03]. The speaker suggests it's likely a combination of both factors [00:03:22].

## Company Pay Philosophies: Leaders vs. Laggers
Companies generally approach compensation with one of two philosophies:
*   **Pay Leaders** These companies aim to pay above market rates to attract and retain top talent, and even poach talent from competitors [00:03:28].
*   **Pay Laggers** These companies have a compensation philosophy that factors in higher turnover rates into their business model [00:03:38].

However, even pay laggers eventually need to retain intellectual and "tribal" knowledge and skills [00:03:46]. Constantly replacing employees is more expensive due to recruiting costs, training new hires, and the cost of lost knowledge and experience [00:03:54].

### Why Employees Accept Counteroffers
Despite general advice against accepting counteroffers, the employee in the anecdote accepted the 15-dollar-per-hour raise [00:04:05]. Reasons for accepting a counteroffer include:
*   Familiarity and comfort with existing processes [00:04:17].
*   Vested benefits like vacation time and 401ks [00:05:10].
*   Knowing current coworkers and work processes [00:05:16].
*   Avoiding the "pain" of onboarding at a new company and feeling like the "new person" [00:05:24].
*   The risk that "the grass isn't greener" at a new company, leading to disillusionment with higher salaries but unfulfilling work or dysfunctional [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | company culture]] [00:04:25]. This phenomenon of returning to a previous employer is called "boomeranging" [00:04:36].

## The Importance of Regularly Testing the Open Market
To ensure fair compensation and career progression, individuals should regularly test the open market [00:05:33].
*   **Frequency:** At a minimum, every two years [00:05:42].
*   **Method:** Submit applications, network with recruiters in your field [00:05:46].
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Stay informed about market trends [00:05:52].
    *   Understand required skills and assessment methods [00:05:55].
    *   Determine if your current compensation is competitive or if you are underpaid relative to the market [00:06:03]. This relates to [[competitive_salary_and_benefits_evaluation | competitive salary and benefits evaluation]].

While it's important to understand your market value, leveraging every small offer with your current employer is not advisable, as the company might eventually call your bluff [00:06:11]. However, knowing market trends for [[understanding_job_expectations_and_compensation | understanding job expectations and compensation]] is crucial [00:06:25].

## Wage Stagnation and Internal Equity Issues
Employees who stay in a role for a long time are often passed by the market [00:06:28].
*   **External vs. Internal Raises:** Companies hire new talent from outside the market, offering significant raises (10-20%) [00:06:34]. Internal employees typically receive smaller promotional bonuses (5-10%) every few years [00:07:17].
*   **New Hires vs. Experienced Staff:** It's common for new hires with less experience to earn the same as, or even more than, long-term employees [00:07:34].
*   **Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs):** Small incremental raises (1-3%) often don't keep pace with inflation, meaning employees are effectively making less money for the same job [00:07:44].
*   **[[salary_negotiation_and_internal_equity | Salary Negotiation and Internal Equity]]:** Companies may intentionally underpay employees who are not "squeaky wheels" or testing the market [00:08:22]. Recruiters often observe internal departments paying 20-30% below market rate [00:08:44]. These pay issues are frequent and may or may not be adjusted by HR [00:09:00].

If an employee has been in the same job or role for more than two or three years without significant raises or promotions, the market has likely passed them by [00:09:21]. Falling too far behind market rates can make it impossible to catch up unless the company initiates a major salary adjustment [00:09:37].

## Taking Ownership of Your Career
Proactively engaging with the job market every couple of years allows individuals to stay informed about industry trends and ensure they are being compensated fairly [00:09:43]. This approach involves exploring opportunities at "pay leaders" or "Alpha employers" to gauge market rates [00:09:51]. If a significant salary increase is offered only when an employee announces their intent to leave, without a corresponding promotional raise, it indicates that the employee was likely underpaid initially [00:10:21].

For those looking to secure better opportunities and higher pay, resources and training are available to help:
*   **Resume Development:** Creating a recruiter-approved, professional-quality resume is the first step to attracting better opportunities [00:10:51].
*   **Interviewing and [[salary_negotiation_strategies | Salary Negotiation Strategies]]:** Learning to effectively market oneself at each stage of the interview process to maximize job offers and ensure no compensation is left on the table [00:11:13].
*   **Networking:** Building a strong network is essential, as many great opportunities come through targeted networking rather than job applications [00:11:36]. This can help bypass gatekeepers like recruiters and get direct access to the interview process [00:12:00].

Staying abreast of the constantly changing market is crucial for career success [00:12:19].

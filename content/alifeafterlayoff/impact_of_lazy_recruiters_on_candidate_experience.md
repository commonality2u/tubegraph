Employment ghosting is a common and frustrating experience for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. It occurs when an employer initiates a formalized interviewing process with a candidate but then fails to provide any follow-up on the application's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This phenomenon is considered poor [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Ghosting Due to Lazy Recruiting

The primary reason candidates may experience ghosting is often attributed to lazy recruiting or individual lazy [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This is considered the most common cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### Lack of Effort and Organization
Lazy [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiters]] often fail to close the loop with candidates because it requires too much effort or they are preoccupied with other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Recruiters who are disorganized or lack a strong focus on [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]] will not provide timely updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This negligence can stem from simply forgetting or not caring, which results in a poor impression of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
While not an excuse for poor [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]], [[effects_of_overloaded_recruiters_on_job_applicants | overloaded recruiters]] can contribute to the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. A professional [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] typically manages 15 to 25 requisitions, depending on the industry and role complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. When a [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] is assigned 40 to 50 requisitions—double a reasonable workload—[[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]] will inevitably suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Managing potentially 200+ candidates at any given time can cause even the most organized recruiters to miss follow-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Forgetfulness
Sometimes, a [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] may simply forget to follow up with a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This is more likely when dealing with a high volume of candidates and lacking proper tools or processes to track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. However, this is still considered poor performance and bad practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness
[[hiring_manager_indecisiveness_and_its_impact_on_job_candidates | Hiring manager indecisiveness]] is a significant factor that can lead to the perception of ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. When a [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] submits a candidate, and the hiring manager delays making a decision—often requesting additional candidates—it prolongs the process by weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. In such cases, the [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] should push back on the hiring manager to disposition the candidate, as prolonged indecision indicates a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. A lack of this proactive push from the [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] can appear as ghosting to the candidate.

### Position Placed on Hold or Closed
A job position may be placed on hold or re-scoped during the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. While recruiters may be asked to keep candidates "lukewarm," meaning they're not a perfect fit but still considered, this leads to an undesirable candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. If a requisition is eventually closed, [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiters]] sometimes fail to disposition all remaining candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Similarly, if another candidate is hired, a lazy or unorganized [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] might close the requisition without informing other candidates who were in process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or ineffective recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Addressing the Issue
Forward-thinking organizations like Amazon prioritize [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Amazon holds its [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiters]] to strict metrics, implementing a "two and five promise" that mandates feedback within two days of a hiring manager phone screen and five days of an on-site interview loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This forces efficiency and decisiveness from hiring teams and [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Companies recognize that job seekers are often also customers, and poor interview experiences can negatively [[impact_on_job_seekers | impact on job seekers]] and their perception of the company's brand and bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

For job seekers who believe they have been ghosted, the most effective action is to send a polite "nudge" to the [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] to inquire about the application status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This can prompt the [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiter]] to provide an update or properly close out the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

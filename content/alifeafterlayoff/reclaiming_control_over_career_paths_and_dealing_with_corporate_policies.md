Many individuals face challenges in their job applications, sometimes unable to secure even a basic interview or get hired, particularly by former employers, despite parting on good terms and being qualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can lead to the suspicion of being "blacklisted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Unfortunately, this is a real phenomenon, with companies like Meta confirming they maintain such "block lists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

It is crucial for individuals to begin the process of [[strategies_for_reclaiming_control_in_careers|reclaiming control over their career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> to avoid being at the mercy of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Resources are available to help make a [[strategies_for_career_development_and_job_searching|job search]] easier and unlock true [[strategies_for_effective_career_progression|career potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Corporate Blacklists (Do Not Hire Lists)

Recent revelations from former Meta employees, documented in a Business Insider expose, confirm the existence of "do not hire" lists that prevent former staff from being rehired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### How Meta's System Works

Meta maintains internal lists, including a "non-regrettable attrition designation" and a "do not hire flag," to track rehire ineligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. While the mechanisms and number of affected people are unclear, most companies track similar information within their HRIS (Human Resources Information System) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Recruiters typically check with the HR department for rehire eligibility, receiving a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Experiences of Blacklisted Employees

A senior engineer, caught in Meta's 2022 layoffs, applied for nearly 20 positions within a year and consistently encountered a pattern: hiring managers expressed interest, but the company's internal recruiters would ghost them before a screening call could be set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This engineer learned they were deemed "ineligible for rehire" by the recruiting team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

> "The recruiting team had forbid the hiring manager from contacting the engineer because they were deemed ineligible for rehire." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>

Many of these laid-off individuals were not performance-based layoffs but rather came from business groups being de-emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, with some even having "exceeding expectations" ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite being told their layoff was "simply a business decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> and having hiring managers interested in bringing them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, HR policies often stepped in to blacklist them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### The "Scarlet Letter" Effect

When tech companies like Meta shifted their layoff justification to "performance-based," it created a "scarlet letter" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This means former employees laid off from Meta are now often viewed by other Silicon Valley hiring managers as poor performers and ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, creating an invisible barrier in an already competitive job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### How to Discover if You're Blacklisted

Companies will not disclose if you're on a do-not-hire list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. However, one common way former Meta employees found out was through third-party headhunting agencies or recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. After a third-party recruiter submits a candidate's application, the company might inform them that the candidate is on a "do not hire list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Reasons for Being Blacklisted

Clear-cut reasons for being added to a do-not-hire list include:
*   Violating workplace policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
*   Stealing confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   Quitting without notice or "rage quitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
*   Performance termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
*   Involuntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
*   Voluntarily separating, depending on the circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   Last performance ratings prior to separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>

However, some former managers report that managers often have broad discretion to add names to the list without documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, potentially even if a manager simply "didn't like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. A manager can mark turnover as "non-regrettable attrition" simply by filling out a form, effectively blacklisting an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

When a candidate is on a do-not-hire list, initial communication with a recruiter may be smooth and consistent, but once deeper interaction with the company begins, things slow down, communication gaps widen, and vague answers are given, often leading to a sudden rejection letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Informal Blacklisting for New Applicants

Even if you've never worked for a company, you can still face informal blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

This often occurs if:
*   You apply for the same job repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   You apply for numerous different jobs at the same company (e.g., 30-40 applications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Staffing teams and hiring managers may bias against such candidates, wondering why other teams haven't hired them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Amazon, for instance, had a "recycle period" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. If a candidate failed a technical skill screen (e.g., coding), they could reapply after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. However, if they failed on "leadership principles" (behavior-based interview), there was often no recycling, effectively banning them permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

Applying for every single job on a company's applicant tracking system, especially if the jobs are unrelated, can make a candidate appear "spammy," leading to informal blacklisting <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Backdoor References

Another way employers can blacklist candidates is through "backdoor references" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This occurs when a hiring team member contacts someone they know at your previous company to ask about your performance or character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. These informal references can sink a candidate's chances or lead to blacklisting, often without the candidate's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This practice is particularly prevalent in smaller industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Reclaiming Control Over Your Career

While do-not-hire lists exist, they are not a widespread practice, so it's not something to "lose a ton of sleep over" unless a specific large tech company is the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The focus should be on [[career_management_and_planning|building a career]] with high conviction and authority, which involves [[proactive_career_management_strategies|reclaiming control]] and not tolerating employers who engage in such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

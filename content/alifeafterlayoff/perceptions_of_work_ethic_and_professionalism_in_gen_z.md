From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

Recent data indicates a significant trend of employers terminating Gen Z workers at a high rate, largely due to [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_employers | cultural mismatch]] and perceptions of professionalism and work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Survey Findings on Recent College Graduates
A survey conducted by intelligent.com in August involved 966 business leaders responsible for hiring decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The survey focused on their attitudes towards recent college graduates, effectively the Gen Z workforce they had recently hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Key findings include:
*   **Hiring Rates** 75% of companies reported having hired Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Termination Rates** Six out of ten companies admitted to firing a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This indicates that employers are quick to fire despite being slow to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Prevalence of Issues** 75% of companies reported at least one issue with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Top Reasons for Gen Z Not Working Out
The most frequently cited reasons for these new hires failing in their roles include:
*   **Lack of Motivation or Initiative** (50% of employers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   **Lack of [[professionalism_in_workplace_interactions | Professionalism]]** (nearly 46%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

*   **Lack of Communication Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   **[[Challenges faced by Gen Z in the workplace | Challenges]] with Feedback** (not taking feedback well) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   **Lack of Relevant Work Experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   **Poor Problem-Solving Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **Insufficient Technical Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   **Bad Culture Fit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   **Difficulty Working in a Team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

## Employer Beliefs and [[Employer expectations for recent college graduates | Expectations]]
Hiring managers hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:
*   **Entitlement** (65-70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, often trying to get promoted too quickly or seeking high salaries without demonstrating experience or "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Easily Offended** (65%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Lack of Work Ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Unprepared for the Workforce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Higher Cost to Train** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technological Skills** (28%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, which is surprising given Gen Z's upbringing with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Workload Management** One in five employers reported Gen Z often cannot manage the workload and are unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Punctuality and Dress Code** About 20% noted Gen Z being late to start and not dressing professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Language and Meeting Punctuality** 19% observed inappropriate language at work and frequent lateness to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Difficulty Managing** 17% found Gen Z difficult to manage and prone to handing in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This contrasts sharply with workplace expectations, where lateness can lead to performance improvement plans or termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## The [[the_disconnect_between_college_life_and_the_modern_workforce | Disconnect Between College and Career]]
Despite spending over $100,000 on college degrees, many Gen Z employees are perceived as unprepared for the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. There is a "huge cultural disconnect" and insufficient transition training to acclimate them to the working world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

This [[challenges_in_the_modern_workplace | disconnect]] is further highlighted by the fact that one in seven companies may not hire any college graduates in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, and one out of six hiring managers is hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. They seek a stronger work ethic and better attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Anecdotal Evidence and [[Social media stories about workplace experiences | Case Studies]]
Various professionals share their experiences with Gen Z employees:

*   **Construction Company Owner** A construction company owner in Southern California noted that young people under 30 often "completely lack communication skills," have "zero critical thinking," are "devoid of any motivation," and "require constant supervision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. They exhibit "zero attention to detail," get frustrated easily, and "refuse to separate themselves from their phones," being unable to focus for more than 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Emergency Department Nurse** A new nurse graduate in an emergency department was constantly on her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and even texted friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. When her phone was locked away, she had a "tantrum" and chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This led to the department stopping the hiring of new nurse grads, impacting those with good work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Government IT Professional** Computer science graduates hired for entry-level IT admin positions did not last more than six months due to "no focus, attention, communication skills, any urgency, professionalism," and "social and professional dysfunction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### TikTok [[Social media stories about workplace experiences | Stories]] of Termination
Individuals on TikTok openly discuss being fired, with an apparent prevalence among women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Accounting Roles** One Gen Z individual recounted being fired from two accounting roles within the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   **First Job:** Fired for being on her phone too much, citing the role as "boring" and the company culture as having "snitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Management moved her desk to directly in front of their own to monitor her phone usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
    *   **Second Job:** Fired after a coworker reported she was coming in "whenever I felt like it" and "thought I was too good for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Despite her contract allowing flexible hours, the perception of her behavior led to termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. She later learned responsibility and found a more fulfilling career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Absenteeism and Tardiness** Another individual was terminated for consistent tardiness (12 to 32 minutes late) and a "no call no show" on her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. She showed a "sense of entitlement" and "lack of responsibility," not seeing an issue with her actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **"Quiet Quitting"** A male Gen Z individual revealed he was fired for "not doing anything" for 15 months until they found out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This highlights the concept of "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place" where employees do minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. Such behaviors are less tolerated in the current job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## [[Strategies for Gen Z to succeed in their careers | What Employers are Looking For]]
Employers are giving clear feedback on desired traits:
*   **Initiative and Positive Attitudes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Strong Work Ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Openness to Feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Punctuality and Reliability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Solid Technical Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Interpersonal Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Internship Experience** Recruiters actively seek candidates with internship experience as early as possible in their degree programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Work-Appropriate [[Social media and professional reputation | Social Media]] Presence** Employers review social media profiles to assess cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Posting about slacking off can negatively impact professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. It's crucial to separate personal and professional online identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Political Topics** Discussions about politics in the workplace can lead to termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Nuance and Context
It's important to recognize that these perceptions do not apply to the entire Gen Z population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. While some "bad apples" may spoil the perception for others, many Gen Z employees are highly motivated, driven, methodical, and strategy-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Gen Z is entering the workforce during one of the most difficult job markets ever experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. They are also driving positive changes, such as emphasizing work-life balance, which is a welcome development in an increasingly unhealthy workplace environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

Employers have historically held similar criticisms for every new generation entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Gen Z should focus on fundamental professional behaviors to counter negative perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

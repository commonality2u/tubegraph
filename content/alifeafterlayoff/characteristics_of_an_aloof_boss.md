The aloof boss is one of the [[common_types_of_bad_bosses | 10 common bad boss types]] that employees may encounter in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. While generally likable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, this type of boss presents unique challenges due to their lack of engagement and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Identifying an Aloof Boss

An aloof boss can be identified by several key characteristics:
*   **Lack of Departmental Awareness** They often do not truly know what is happening in their department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Employees might question if they have a good grasp on the work being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, or if they could even fill in if an employee were to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Disconnected from Teams** An aloof boss is generally not well-connected to the work an employee is doing or the teams they support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Limited Help with Roadblocks** They are typically not much help in clearing up roadblocks for their team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Requires Constant Reminders** Employees may find themselves repeatedly having to remind an aloof boss to follow up on things they committed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Although not the worst type of boss, an aloof boss is not considered ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It is beneficial to have a boss who can reliably help clear obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. If you find yourself in a situation with an aloof boss, having a game plan for your career is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. A steady job should not be an excuse to tolerate a bad work situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

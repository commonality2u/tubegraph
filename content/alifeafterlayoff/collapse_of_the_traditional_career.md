The concept of a traditional career, where an individual selects a path at age 18, dedicates 40 years to a single employer, and then retires with a pension, is now considered "completely dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This model, which emphasized loyalty from both employee and employer, largely no longer exists in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Traditional Career Model

Generations past, such as grandparents and parents, often experienced long, traditional careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. At age 18, they could easily enter the workforce and secure their first job, often through nepotism or by simply submitting a basic resume to a "Personnel department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They would then proceed to work a fulfilling 45-year career, secure a great pension plan, and retire comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. In this era, employers were expected to treat employees with loyalty, and constant layoffs were not common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Even if an employee wasn't excelling in one role, they might be moved to a different department rather than being let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Reasons for the Collapse

Several factors have contributed to the [[disenchantment_with_traditional_career_paths | collapse of the traditional career model]]:

### Short-Term Mentality and Layoff Cycles

Today's work environment is characterized by instant gratification, focusing on immediate results and the next news cycle or earnings report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This fosters a "what have you done for me lately" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Companies now operate with a short-term mentality, leading to frequent cycles of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. These layoff cycles tend to follow economic patterns:
*   **Expansion:** Companies "bloat" as the economy expands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Major Event:** A significant event (e.g., dot-com bubble burst, 9/11, 2008 housing crisis, 2020 pandemic) triggers mass layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Rightsizing:** Companies "right size" by reducing their workforce before business resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Historically, this cycle occurred over approximately a 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, this cycle appears to be "shortening and shortening and exponentially moving quicker," which is detrimental for the average employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Unlike previous generations who were less susceptible to layoffs, current employees face them more commonly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Globalization and Increased Competition

Hiring was once a very localized process, where companies recruited from their immediate geographic region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Today, the global economy, coupled with the rise of job boards and platforms like LinkedIn, means that individuals compete with thousands of applicants worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This fierce competition makes it significantly harder to secure a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Additionally, the vast pool of available labor means companies can lay off employees more easily, as they have millions of candidates readily available to fill vacancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Shift in Retirement Benefits

A major shift in the employment arrangement occurred with the transition from "defined benefits" plans (pensions), where employers paid for an employee's entire retirement, to "defined contribution" plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This change shifted the financial burden of retirement onto the employee, with employers often providing only a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

To exacerbate matters, companies implemented long vesting periods (often four or more years) for employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This means if an employee is laid off before their employer's contribution is fully vested, they lose that money, further reducing employer commitment and contributing to [[retirement_instability_and_career_setbacks | retirement instability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Rise of Disruptive Technologies

The emergence of disruptive technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), is transforming the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. AI is considered the most disruptive technology to enter the workforce conversation in generations, with the potential to displace millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This technology further enables employers to detach from employee loyalty, as they may no longer need human employees in the same capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## The Future of Work

Given the permanent collapse of the traditional career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, the way individuals approach work is drastically changing. Future trends include:

*   **Short-Term Assignments:** More prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **[[current_trends_in_job_hopping | Job Hopping]]**: Will become less taboo, as frequent layoffs make it difficult for individuals to maintain long tenures at a single company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. It is hypocritical for hiring managers to criticize [[current_trends_in_job_hopping | job hopping]] when companies themselves initiate frequent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Contract Positions:** A continued rise in contract roles as employers seek to avoid the costs associated with full-time employees, such as benefits and 401k contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This represents a move away from the traditional employment model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Employee-Led Retirement Funding:** Individuals will need to re-evaluate how they fund their retirement, as relying on employers for 401k contributions becomes increasingly unreliable due to frequent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This is particularly disruptive for those nearing retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Strategic Career Management:** It is becoming necessary to approach careers strategically, acting as a "free agent" and the "CEO of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Employees can no longer rely on employers to look out for their best interests, as older generations might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Reference checks are a common part of the job application process, with applicants often asked to provide professional references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The practices for conducting these checks, and the information shared, can vary significantly between smaller companies and larger corporations due to differing policies and concerns over liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## How Reference Checks Are Conducted

Generally, when a company performs a [[importance_of_reference_checks_in_the_hiring_process | reference check]], they contact the provided reference and go through a series of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These questions typically relate to:
*   The job and work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Attendance, especially for hourly positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   Strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Eligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

## Small Companies and Agencies

Smaller companies or [[differences_between_headhunters_and_corporate_recruiters | agencies]] that submit candidates to larger corporations are more likely to require and follow through on professional references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These companies tend to be less strict on their reference check policies compared to larger entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Large Corporations and Liability Concerns

Larger corporations, and some small to medium-sized companies, are often reluctant to provide detailed [[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | references]] due to concerns about liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This reluctance stems from the risk of being sued for slander if negative feedback is given that might prevent a candidate from getting a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Human Resources (HR) professionals in large companies prioritize limiting exposure to potential liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

As a result, most major employers generally do not check [[importance_of_reference_checks_in_the_hiring_process | references]] or give extensive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. They often instruct employees with direct reports not to give out references and to filter any requests back to the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

When large corporations do provide information during a reference check, it is typically limited to "name, rank, and serial number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, meaning they only confirm:
*   The individual's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   Date of employment (start and end dates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
*   Job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

Information such as compensation, rehire eligibility, or reasons for termination is usually not provided due to liability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Providing References as an Applicant

If you are asked to provide [[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | references]], take it seriously, especially with smaller companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Key tips include:

*   **Ensure Legitimacy**: Provide professional references who can genuinely speak to your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Ideally, this includes a direct manager, or at least someone one or two levels above you who witnessed your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Avoid using peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Confirm Positive Feedback**: Only list individuals who you are sure will give you a good reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Seek Permission**: Always ask for permission from your potential references before listing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Inform them that they might receive a call as part of your interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This helps ensure they will return calls quickly, speeding up the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

For most major employers, [[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | reference checks]] are often a final formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. If you reach this stage, it often indicates an offer is likely forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

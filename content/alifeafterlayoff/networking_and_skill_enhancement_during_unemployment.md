Experiencing a layoff can be a catastrophic event in a professional career, especially for those encountering it for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The process often involves a pre-canned speech from HR and your boss, leading to a state of shock as you realize you've lost access to company systems and are no longer part of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This can feel like a betrayal of trust and honesty, leading to feelings of worthlessness and overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. It's perfectly normal to enter a state of shock and go through a mourning process, as it is a real loss with stages of grief that need to be processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Taking time off immediately after the layoff to clear your mind is advisable, perhaps by taking a long drive or a nature hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. While scary, it's crucial to remember that things will be okay with appropriate steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Initial Steps After Layoff

Processing the emotional impact is paramount; allow yourself to feel angry, mad, and to second-guess yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Bottling up these emotions can make things worse long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Accept that you are wounded and need to heal, spending appropriate time on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Financial Assessment and Planning

After processing, it's essential to assess your financial situation by examining bills, budget, and monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. This often involves making difficult decisions and changing spending habits, especially regarding "budget creep" where expenses slowly increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Look for non-value-adding expenses to cut, such as subscriptions, planned vacations, or even high car payments if they become unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The goal is to reduce liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

Hopeful access to an emergency fund is critical; if none exists, quickly seeking part-time work may be necessary due to often low unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Understand your cash flow, including unemployment benefits, severance, and vacation payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Tapping into retirement accounts should be a last resort to avoid long-term financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

### Strategic Career Planning

Rather than immediately updating your resume and rushing into a job search, the first step should be creating a comprehensive career strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This allows for careful planning of next steps, preventing a knee-jerk reaction that might lead to an undesirable job, a step backward in responsibility, or reduced pay, which can harm your long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Every job taken either strengthens or weakens your resume, so mapping out a [[strategizing_career_moves_after_job_loss | strategy]] is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## [[Importance of networking and multiple income streams | Networking]] and [[Strategies for job security and skill development | Skill Enhancement]]

Once your career strategy is developed, then proceed with updating your resume and entering an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Your Network

Actively tapping into your network is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. If your [[networking_and_accessing_the_hidden_job_market | network]] or [[networking_and_building_connections_on_linkedin | LinkedIn presence]] has been neglected, spend significant energy optimizing it early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. [[Networking for job opportunities | Networking]] offers both practical job search benefits and moral support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. It's a consistent activity, not something to be neglected in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### Enhancing Your Skill Set

Take stock of your current skills in relation to market demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. If job descriptions reveal critical skill gaps, this is the time to brush up through free courses, volunteering, or shadowing/mentoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. The aim is to become the most attractive candidate possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Including relevant keywords on your resume is important, and ideally, these skills should be demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

Alongside skill enhancement, polish your interview skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Interviewing can be intimidating, especially with the pressure of unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Having a "tight interview game" and approaching it with confidence improves your chances of being noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

## Severance Package and Professional Support

When offered a severance package, do not sign it immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Take time (usually a couple of weeks) to understand its contents, especially regarding benefit continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. While COBRA offers benefit continuation, it's often expensive as you pay the full cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Consider opting out of COBRA and negotiating a lump sum payment for benefits, then seeking a more cost-effective catastrophic plan on the government marketplace, which can offer significant tax benefits due to reduced income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Though leverage is reduced during a layoff, if you are in a protected class (e.g., over 40), you might be able to negotiate for additional benefits like missed bonuses or equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

Many companies offer outplacement assistance, which connects you with a company to help with resume writing and job search strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. However, the quality of these services can be poor, providing outdated advice and ineffective resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. It is recommended to ask for this assistance as a lump sum (often $3,000-$5,000) instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This allows you to choose your own career coach who resonates with you, potentially receiving better service and even pocketing the financial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

If you find yourself struggling with the job search and beginning to panic, seek help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Resources like channels offering interview advice and [[networking_and_job_market_strategies_for_career_advancement | job search advice]] from experienced corporate recruiters can provide accurate insights into what recruiters and hiring managers seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Online resources, courses like "Unlocking LinkedIn" for [[networking_and_building_connections_on_linkedin | LinkedIn optimization]], or "Resume Rocket Fuel" for resume strategy, and "The Ultimate Jobseeker Bootcamp" for comprehensive job search and negotiation tactics, can be highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Private coaching is also an option for individualized support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. The goal is to get back on the job market as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

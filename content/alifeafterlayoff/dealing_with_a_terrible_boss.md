Dealing with a terrible boss is a common and often inevitable part of a professional career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. It is the most frequent reason people cite for leaving their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The dissatisfaction stemming from a bad boss is the primary motivator for seeking new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Impact of a Terrible Boss

A poor manager can significantly affect your career and well-being:
*   **Diminished Self-Worth** If you were a top performer previously, a new bad boss might make you feel like a failure, questioning your self-worth and hindering your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Emotional and Physical Drain** Tolerating a job you hate, often due to a bad boss, is emotionally and even physically draining, affecting not only you but also your loved ones and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Terrible Boss

Bosses who lack emotional intelligence and exhibit poor leadership traits often rise to leadership positions when they have no business being there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Signs of a terrible boss include:
*   **Arbitrary Actions** Cutting earned bonuses of employees simply because they "felt like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Public Humiliation** Throwing employees "under the bus" in public settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, or reprimanding staff in front of peers or other organizational members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Demotivating Feedback** Providing feedback in a way that crushes an employee's will or makes them want to quit on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Dismissing Ideas** Dismissing employee ideas or demotivating them through criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Conversely, a good leader provides motivational feedback that helps improve performance, rather than crushing morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## When to Consider Leaving

If you find yourself in circumstances involving a terrible boss, it is time to seriously consider leaving your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While companies value candidates who persevere through adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, and there is a perception that "job hopping is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, recruiters and hiring managers understand the difference between frequent job changes and leaving a bad situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

You should not feel obligated to stay in a job that does not align with your core values or that causes physical or mental harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. A steady job is not a valid excuse for tolerating a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> or [[Toxic workplace environment and employee treatment | poor working conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. If your manager is oblivious to, or even aligned with, [[Toxic workplace environment and employee treatment | toxic colleagues]], it is time to look elsewhere as you are unlikely to "win" in such a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. It is better to find a position free from such [[Strategies to deal with toxic workplaces | toxicity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

The [[great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] was the first major employment trend marking a new approach to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This phenomenon, which saw a wave of resignations, began to hit around 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Background

The market conditions leading up to the [[great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] stemmed from the major economic downturn in 2020, which was a direct result of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

> [!INFO] Employer Reactions and Employee Burden
> Employers at the time had a "knee-jerk reaction" and laid off many employees they "probably shouldn't have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This had a rippling effect on the workforce, as remaining employees were required to take on the additional work burden of those who were forcibly exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This period was characterized by stress, long hours, and a pervasive mantra in the employment market: "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Employers also "demanded more from their employees and cut back on all kinds of expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Catalyst for Change

During this time, people became "very burnt out" and started to reevaluate what they truly wanted in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

*   **Displaced Workers** Individuals who were displaced questioned working "all these hours and all these years for a company to unceremoniously be shown the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Remaining Workers** Those who remained began to wonder if their current work was "really the type of work that they wanted to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

This widespread [[career_dissatisfaction_and_changes | career dissatisfaction]] and [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | employee dissatisfaction]] led to the emergence of the [[great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Impact and Market Shift

The [[great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] forcibly swung the pendulum of power in the employment market towards the job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This era was seen as a "Heyday of job seeking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, where opportunities were abundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Key characteristics and impacts during this period:
*   People received raises frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Many left opportunities for better pay and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Some moved from stable environments to "more risky opportunities for the sake of collecting a better paycheck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

This period led to a disengaged workforce, with many essentially resigning from their current roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_great_resignation_on_employment | impact of the Great Resignation on employment]] caused industries to react due to not having enough people to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

In a difficult job search, job seekers might be tempted to embellish their resumes to gain a competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises on the ethical boundaries of resume adjustments, differentiating between minor "white lies" that can optimize your chances of being noticed and outright falsifications that lead to severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

A resume's primary purpose is to capture a recruiter's immediate attention, often within a five-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. If key information is not immediately visible, the resume is likely to be discarded without further consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Therefore, [[how_to_effectively_convey_information_in_resumes|effectively conveying information]] and positioning oneself advantageously is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Strategic Resume Adjustments ("White Lies")

Certain adjustments to a resume might be considered acceptable to [[strategic_resume_writing_and_optimization_for_job_seekers|strategically optimize]] visibility, provided they don't involve outright fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. These are meant to make your resume more palatable to a recruiter for an initial call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

*   **Job Titles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>: If your job title is proprietary and different from the common market term for the same role, it is acceptable to change it on your resume to match the broader generic market. This increases discoverability and likelihood of being noticed by recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Recruiters typically won't verify exact proprietary job titles with your former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is part of [[optimizing_and_customizing_resumes_for_job_applications|optimizing and customizing resumes]] for specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Contracting Employer Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>: If you worked for a third-party agency but were exclusively supporting a name-brand company, where you were integrated into their team, used their email, and your boss was from the main company, it might be acceptable to list the name-brand company as your employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. However, be prepared to explain the contractual arrangement later in the process, especially during background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Listing the well-known company can look better than an unknown third-party agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>: If you are actively planning to move to a new location and are targeting jobs there, listing your address in that new location might increase your chances of getting calls in the local market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Be ready to bear all relocation and interview travel costs yourself, as indicating you are local might cause companies to not budget for relocation assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Dates of Employment (Vague Years)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>: Instead of specific months and years, only listing the years of employment (e.g., 2017-2020) can make your tenure appear longer or smooth over periods of job hopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This is a form of [[strategic_resume_writing_and_optimization_for_job_seekers|massaging information]] to appear more desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. However, be prepared to provide specific dates if directly asked during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Easily Acquired Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>: If a job description lists "preferred" skills that are common, easy to learn, and can be acquired quickly (e.g., learning Google Docs if you know Microsoft Word), it's acceptable to claim proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The key is to be able to apply the skill functionally by the time you start the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Reason for Leaving (Avoiding "Fired")** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>: Do not explicitly state on your resume or initial application that you were fired or laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Options include leaving the reason blank or stating "better opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Recruiters tend to judge this information negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. If directly asked, be honest but have a well-crafted explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Information Never to Lie About

Outright falsifying information on a job application, which is considered a legal document, can lead to terminated offers or employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

*   **Employers You Never Worked For** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>: Never invent an employer you did not work for. This will be exposed during the interviewing or background check process, leading to immediate disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **References** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>: Do not ask a friend to impersonate a former boss, especially if you anticipate a negative review from your actual previous manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. It's better to honestly explain a difficult relationship with a former boss and provide alternative, relevant references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Specific Employment Dates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>: While it's acceptable to use vague years, do not add extra years to your employment history or lie about current employment if you have a significant gap. This is a direct falsification that will be uncovered during background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Hard-to-Acquire Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>: Do not lie about complex skills, such as programming languages, that are not easily learned before your start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. You will be exposed during the interview process, and even if hired, you will be set up to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Education** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>: Never lie about having a degree or certification you don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Educational claims are routinely verified through background checks, and falsifying them will lead to losing the offer and being blacklisted by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Criminal Record** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>: Do not omit or lie about a criminal record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Background checks will reveal this information, and it's better to be honest and provide an explanation than to lie and lose the job for certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Years of Experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>: Do not inflate your years of experience, especially if a role requires a specific minimum (e.g., 5-7 years when you only have 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. You will likely be exposed during interviews, or if you somehow get hired, you will be set up to fail due to lack of expected experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. It's advisable to find roles appropriate for your actual experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

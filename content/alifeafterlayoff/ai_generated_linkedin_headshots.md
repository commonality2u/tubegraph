## The App: Remini
The app used for generating these headshots is called Remini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It has gained popularity for its ability to transform casual selfies into professional-looking headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

1.  Open the app and select the [[AI technology in photography | AI]] photos feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
2.  Upload 8 to 12 selfies of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
3.  Select your gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
4.  Choose a reference image or aesthetic that you want your generated photos to emulate, such as a "modern" or "curriculum" style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
5.  The app then processes these images to create a variety of headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The initial rendering may take a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Examples and Results
The [[AI technology in photography | AI]] generates "pretty convincing professional headshots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

While most results appear highly convincing, one example showed a slightly "fake" appearance, particularly around the shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

In a personal experiment, the speaker generated several headshots for himself, finding some to be very good and even making him look younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

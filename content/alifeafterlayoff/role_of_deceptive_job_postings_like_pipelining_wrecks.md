## Overview
Deceptive job postings, particularly "pipelining wrecks," refer to job advertisements that companies post with no genuine intention of filling the role at the time of posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>. These postings are specifically designed to collect applications for future use, theoretically allowing companies to move quicker when an actual need arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## Recruiter's Perspective
From a recruiter's standpoint, there is a significant issue with [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | pipelining wrecks]] due to their deceptive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The speaker considers them misleading and generally ineffective in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers
The [[impact_of_pipelining_job_vacancies_on_candidates | impact of pipelining job vacancies on candidates]] is particularly negative, especially in a challenging job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. These postings can be very off-putting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Job seekers may apply to these roles with no intention of the position ever being filled, leading to disappointment and added stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. For example, one such posting received 352 applicants with almost no chance of any being called <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. The timing of such postings, especially after layoffs, can be particularly "off-putting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

[[strategies_to_identify_and_avoid_fake_job_postings | Strategies to identify and avoid fake job postings]] such as pipelining wrecks involve recognizing certain [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags in job postings]]:

*   **Lack of Specificity:** The job description will likely be generic, lacking details about a specific role or responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Locations:** A single posting listing numerous locations can be an indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

When facing a difficult job search, it can be tempting to [[the_ethics_of_lying_on_a_resume | lie on your resume]] or "flub things a little bit" to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises that while some "white lies" might optimize your chances of getting noticed, there are absolute boundaries that, if crossed, lead to severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Situations Where "White Lies" Might Be Considered (With Caveats)

A recruiter generally does not condone advising someone to [[the_ethics_of_lying_on_a_resume | lie on their resume]], as candidates should ideally be hired on their merits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. However, some minor manipulations of information might increase the likelihood of getting an initial call from a recruiter, who often gives a resume only a five-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The goal is to "manipulate" information to position oneself advantageously, rather than outright fabricating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Job Titles
If your current job title is proprietary but the role's responsibilities align with a more common market title, changing it on your resume might be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, if you were a "production engineer level 1" and the target job is a "manufacturing engineer," it's essentially the same, and changing the title can help a recruiter quickly identify you as a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Recruiters typically won't call your former company to verify the exact proprietary title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Contracting/Third-Party Employment
If you work through a third-party agency but are directly supporting and integrated into a "name brand company" (e.g., same email, day-to-day work, and direct boss are with the main company), it may be acceptable to list the name brand company on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
> [!WARNING] Background Checks
> If you list the name brand company, be prepared to explain that you were hired through a third-party agency as you progress in the interviewing process, especially if a background check might reveal a different payroll entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Not doing so could result in [[consequences_of_failing_an_employment_background_check | hiccups]] during a background check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Location
Stating that you live in a target relocation area when you don't might get you more phone calls in that local market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
> [!WARNING] Relocation Assistance & Costs
> If you claim to be local, you must be prepared to move without any company assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Springing a request for relocation assistance later is considered unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This could also mean losing out on a potential relocation package if the company originally had an appetite to relocate candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. You may incur flight costs for on-site interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Dates of Employment (Vagueness)
It is generally acceptable to list only the years of employment (e.g., 2017 to 2020) rather than specific months and days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This can make your resume look cleaner, especially if you have job hopping, and make you appear more desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
> [!WARNING] Direct Questioning
> If a recruiter directly asks for specific employment dates, you must be honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Not being honest can be a "bad look" and hard to explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Skills (Easily Acquirable)
If a job description lists "preferred" skills that are common and easy to learn quickly (e.g., familiarizing yourself with Google Docs if you only know Microsoft Word), it might be acceptable to claim proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The key is being able to learn and apply the skill by your start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Reason for Leaving (Not Advertising Negatives)
While not lying directly, it's advised not to explicitly advertise on your resume that you were fired, laid off, or quit a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Leaving the reason blank or stating "better opportunity" is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>
> [!WARNING] Immediate Disqualification
> Stating you were fired can immediately put your application in the "no" pile, preventing any chance to explain your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. If directly asked, you must be honest, but try to come up with a diplomatic explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## What You Should NEVER Lie About

Lying on an application is considered a [[risks_of_falsifying_information_on_job_applications | falsification of an official document]] and is a terminable offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Consequences can include offers being rescinded or even termination if discovered after hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. The application form is a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### Companies You Never Worked For
Do not invent an employer or claim to have worked for a specific type of company (e.g., a "FANG" company) if you have no actual employment history there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This will be exposed during the interview process, and you will not receive an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### References
Never ask a friend to pretend to be your previous boss for a reference check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>
> [!WARNING] Dishonesty vs. Explanation
> If you are not on good terms with a previous boss, it is better to explain the situation to the recruiter or hiring manager in a "craftful way" and try to provide an alternative reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. It's better to be honest than to lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### Specific Dates of Employment (Adding Years)
Do not add years to your employment history to cover gaps or extend tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Claiming to be currently working when you have an eight or nine-month gap is flat-out [[risks_of_falsifying_information_on_job_applications | falsifying]] information and will be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Skills (Hard to Maintain/Acquire)
Do not claim to have major skills (e.g., a complex computer programming language) if you do not possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. These are difficult to acquire quickly before a start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### Education/Degrees
Never lie about having a degree from an institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Educational claims are verified during background checks by contacting the institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. [[consequences_of_failing_an_employment_background_check | Falsifying a degree]] will lead to the offer being lost and you being blacklisted from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

### Criminal Record
Do not omit a criminal record, such as a felony, if specifically asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. This will be exposed during a background check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. It's better to be honest and explain the situation sincerely, as lying will guarantee you won't get the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

### Years of Experience
Do not lie about having required years of experience (e.g., claiming five to seven years when you only have two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. You will likely be exposed during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Even if you somehow pass the interview, you will be set up to fail in the role, leading to potential career setbacks and turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. It's better to find a role appropriate for your actual experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

While it can be tempting to embellish a resume during a difficult job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises against outright lying on an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. An application is considered a legal document, and falsifying information on it can lead to severe consequences, including job offers being rescinded or even termination if the dishonesty is discovered after hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Consequences of Lying on a Resume
Lying on an application is a falsification of an official document and is a terminable offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Offers have been rescinded, and individuals have been terminated when it was discovered they did not possess what they claimed on their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Specific Areas Never to Lie About

There are several critical areas where [[Consequences of inconsistencies and dishonesty in resumes | dishonesty]] on a resume or application is never recommended:

### Employer History
Do not flat out invent an employer you've never worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. If you falsely claim to have worked for a specific type of company (e.g., a FANG company or a startup) to suggest a particular skill set, you will be exposed during the interview process and will not receive an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### References
Never ask a friend to impersonate a previous boss for a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. If you are not on good terms with a previous boss, it is better to explain the situation to the recruiter or hiring manager truthfully and offer an alternative reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Honesty, even in difficult situations, is preferred over [[Consequences of inconsistencies and dishonesty in resumes | lying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Dates of Employment
While it may be acceptable to keep employment dates somewhat vague on a resume (e.g., only listing years instead of specific months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, you should never lie about the specific dates if asked directly by a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Do not add years to your employment history or claim to be currently working if you have an employment gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This constitutes flat-out falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### Skills
Do not lie about possessing major skill sets that are difficult to acquire quickly, such as computer programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. If you cannot realistically learn a required skill before your potential start date, it is not advisable to claim proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### Education and Certifications
Never lie about having a degree or certification you do not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Educational claims are typically verified during background checks, and falsifying this information will lead to the offer being lost and potentially being blacklisted from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Criminal Record
Do not omit or lie about a criminal record, especially a felony, if specifically asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Background checks will expose this, and it is better to be honest and explain the situation rather than risk losing the job due to [[Consequences of inconsistencies and dishonesty in resumes | dishonesty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

### Years of Experience
Do not inflate your years of experience (e.g., claiming 20 years when you have two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Such a fabrication will be exposed during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Even if by some chance you were hired, you would likely be set up for failure as you would be expected to perform at a level beyond your actual experience, leading to poor career outcomes and potential turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. It is advisable to find a role that is appropriate for your actual experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

Instead of outright lying, the goal is to position yourself advantageously by making your resume palatable for a recruiter to make that initial call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Resources like "Resume Rocket Fuel" can help create an ATS-approved resume designed from a recruiter's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

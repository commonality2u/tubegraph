When seeking new employment, it's crucial to identify [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags]] that indicate a potentially "bad company" or a dysfunctional workplace environment. These signals can appear during the interview process or when observing the company's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Recognizing them early can help you avoid the situation altogether or plan an exit strategy if you're already employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While not every company exhibiting these traits is necessarily bad, they are overarching things to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Phrases and behaviors to watch out for

### "We work hard, we play hard"
This phrase typically suggests an expectation of consistently long and stressful hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Companies using this motto often set unattainable metrics and foster a culture of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The "hard work" is frequently incentivized with hard-to-obtain bonuses or elaborate vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The "play hard" aspect often involves mandatory after-hours or weekend events that are not compensated, requiring employees to participate outside of typical work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This environment can lead to quick burnout, especially for those with family commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### "We are family"
While sometimes used by larger corporations, this phrase is more commonly associated with smaller, privately-owned companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It can be annoying and unrealistic for employees, as their coworkers and bosses are not their actual family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Owners expecting employees to treat the company like their own family is insulting and can sometimes lead to a "cult-like" atmosphere that can be off-putting if you don't share the same enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### "We will promote you later, we promise"
If a company promises a promotion within a specific timeframe (e.g., six months or a year) during an interview to secure your commitment, it's a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This often indicates the company either lacks the budget or is unwilling to pay you what you're worth upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If this promise isn't in writing, you may have to fight for it, and the agreement can become unreliable if your hiring manager leaves the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For current employees, if the promotion "target" constantly moves, it's a strong indicator to update your resume and seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Good companies value their employees and handle promotions properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### "You are replaceable"
A company that openly verbalizes to its employees that they are replaceable signals a lack of value for its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This often comes with strict guidelines and a constant fear of reprimand or sudden replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Working for such a company means giving away your power and living in fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. If a company tells you this, you should make yourself replaceable by finding a better job with an employer that values your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### "We wear a lot of hats here"
This statement, particularly common in startup environments, implies that you'll be expected to perform multiple jobs outside your primary scope, often for a lower salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While some individuals may willingly accept this, it's important to go into such a situation with "eyes wide open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Generally, high-quality companies have the resources to staff roles appropriately, so employees shouldn't have to wear multiple hats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Calling themselves "in startup mode" for years
If a company has been around for five to seven years but still claims to be "in startup mode," it's a significant [[signs_of_organizational_dysfunction_during_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This is often an excuse to overwork employees and avoid proper compensation, similar to the "wearing many hats" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### "We only hire rock stars"
Often seen in [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | job postings]], this phrase aims to attract "the best of the best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, it's a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] if the company isn't willing to compensate for that level of talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It's advisable to check company reviews on platforms like Glassdoor to verify if their actions align with their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### "We are always hiring"
If a company consistently has open positions, especially for the same role, it often indicates a "revolving door" or high turnover rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While rapidly growing companies might be an exception, an established company that is "always hiring" should prompt hard questions during your interview to understand the underlying reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Promises of recall after layoffs
Primarily common in hourly positions, but also possible in salaried roles, a company that lays off employees at the first sign of trouble and promises a "recall" when things improve is a [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Ironically, some of these companies may also claim to be a "family environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Returning to a company that has shown a lack of commitment by laying you off is akin to a "bad relationship" where you're only called when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It's important to have self-respect and seek an employer that is committed to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Boasting about a foosball table
While seemingly innocuous, a foosball table is often touted by "trendy" or "hip" organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, it can be a superficial attempt to mask a poor work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. If a company treats employees poorly, has a toxic culture, or pays low wages, the presence of a foosball table does not make it a high-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Unrealistic salary expectations can significantly hinder a candidate's job search, leading to rejections and a perception of being a "red flag" candidate by potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This issue often arises early in the interview process and can persist through offer negotiation.

## Being Vague or Difficult about Salary Expectations
When asked about salary expectations, kicking the can down the road or being vague can signal to employers that a candidate might be difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>. While some candidates prefer to keep their "hands close to their vest" regarding salary, not providing an answer puts them at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>. Recruiters may delay moving such candidates forward, opting to continue with others who are more forthcoming, ultimately leaving the uncommunicative candidate behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:01">[03:25:01]</a>. There are [[effective_ways_to_discuss_salary_expectations | more effective ways to answer the salary expectation questions]] to avoid leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:07">[03:39:07]</a>.

## Unrealistic Expectations for the Market or Role
A clear sign of a red flag candidate is when their [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers | salary expectations are unrealistic]] for the market, the job type, or, critically, for the skills, knowledge, and ability they bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
This often occurs when a candidate proposes a salary 20%, 30%, or even 40% higher than the competition, which employers find puzzling and out of alignment with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:08">[09:27:08]</a>.
To avoid this, candidates should:
*   Conduct thorough salary research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:04">[09:47:04]</a>.
*   Self-reflect on their unique and differentiated skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:09">[09:50:09]</a>.

## [[the_pitfalls_of_salary_negotiation_in_job_applications | The Pitfalls of Salary Negotiation]] with High Demands
Throwing out a "pie in the sky" number during [[dealing_with_a_lowball_salary_offer | salary negotiation]] when an offer is presented can deter hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:08">[09:58:08]</a>. If this new number is significantly higher (e.g., 30% or 40%) than what was initially provided to the recruiter, it may appear as a "bait and switch" tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This can lead employers to feel their time has been wasted, potentially resulting in them refusing to negotiate or even withdrawing the job offer altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Effective [[negotiation_strategies_for_salary_expectations | offer negotiation]] begins when a candidate first meets the recruiter, not just when the offer is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:08">[10:30:08]</a>.

Interviewing can be daunting, especially when faced with questions that seem simple but are actually designed to test your responses. These are often referred to as "trap" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Identifying and preparing for these questions can significantly increase your chances of success in a job interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Common Trap Interview Questions and How to Answer Them

Brian Kley, a corporate recruiter, has interviewed thousands of people and understands what goes on behind the scenes in hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. He outlines seven common interview trap questions and provides [[preparing_for_interviews_with_targeted_responses | strategies]] to effectively answer them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### 1. "Why did you leave your last job?"

This question tests your professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A negative answer, or a history of job hopping or quitting with little notice, can make you appear unprofessional or demonstrate poor decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Strategy:** Stay positive and remember that less is more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Focus on what you gained from the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. If you were laid off, mention it briefly without dwelling on it, then pivot to your excitement for the new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Example Answer:** "I wanted a role to grow my skills in a specific area, maybe leadership, and my last job didn't offer that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### 2. "What's your biggest weakness?"

This classic trap question assesses your self-awareness and how your potential weakness aligns (or doesn't) with the job's requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

*   **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
    *   Saying you have no weaknesses, which comes across as arrogant and insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   Using clich√©d answers like "I work too hard" or "I care too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   Stating a weakness that is a core competency required for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Pick a real weakness that is not a deal-breaker for the specific job type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Show how you've recognized it and actively worked to fix or improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Research the company's core values to avoid conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Example Answer:** For a team lead position, you might say, "I used to struggle with delegating tasks, but I realized as I moved into more leadership roles that I needed to trust my team. I've learned to do that by understanding their capabilities and distributing the workload equally, which has boosted our productivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### 3. "Where do you see yourself in five years?"

This is a trap if your career goals don't align with the hiring manager's expectations for the role's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Stating an ambition to take the hiring manager's job or having no plan at all can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

*   **Strategy:** Tie your goals to those of the company and the specific job you're applying for, ensuring alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Show ambition and a commitment to the long haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Be honest about your true interests to avoid a career mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Example Answer:** "Ideally, I will have learned this job completely and be exceeding my expectations. In five years, I hope to be on a leadership career path while continuing to help the company's goals and building my leadership competency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### 4. "Tell me about a time when you failed."

This question sets up a scenario to see how you handle setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Blaming others or choosing a massive failure (e.g., costing the company a million dollars) can make you appear unreliable or incompetent, leading to more negative probing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

*   **Strategy:** Pick a relatively small failure that didn't have huge stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Own the mistake, show improvement, and demonstrate growth from the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### 5. "What's your current salary?" or "What are your salary expectations?"

This question can be a trap to lock you into a lower offer or scare them off with high expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Some states even ban the "current salary" question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   For "What's your current salary?": Deflect and focus on the role's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   For "What are your salary expectations?": First, ask them to share their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. If they insist, provide your minimum acceptable salary plus 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   Always do thorough salary research before the interview and be realistic about your skills and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    *   Do not avoid answering this question entirely, as it can lead to rejection or limbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### 6. "What do you know about our job?"

Often mistaken for an icebreaker, this is an actual interview question designed to see if you've done your homework and have a genuine interest in the role and company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Failing to know anything makes you look lazy or unmotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

*   **Strategy:** Research the company's mission, understand the role's responsibilities, and show genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Reading the job posting thoroughly is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Example Answer:** "I know that the company focuses on [goal], they've just launched [new product], and this particular role supports [division] with these key responsibilities. I think I've got a pretty good understanding, but I'm happy for you to elaborate. I'm really excited about this position because of [reason]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   Asking timely questions can help establish a dominant frame in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### 7. "Why do you want to work here?"

While the honest answer might be "I need a job," this question aims to gauge your reasons beyond just a paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Employers want to see if you're passionate and aligned with their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

*   **Strategy:** Swallow your pride and make the answer about *them* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Position yourself as the solution to their hiring needs, showing you're the best fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Demonstrate passion, alignment, and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Example Answer:** "I admire your company's focus on [value], and I feel that based on the product or service you're offering, I would be a great fit because of X, Y, and Z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

A man, known by his Twitter handle "Firrr," was set up for an interview with the same company that had recently fired him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This unusual event, which occurred within two weeks of his termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>, was documented by Firrr on Twitter in a play-by-play format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The story highlights significant oversights in recruitment and hiring processes.

## The Story Unfolds

Firrr, who was unemployed at the time, was contacted by a recruiter who invited him to interview for the exact same position with the same employer he had just been terminated from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The recruiter and the company were evidently unaware he was the recently fired employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Seeing an opportunity for amusement, Firrr decided to proceed with the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Preparation and Arrival
Firrr pondered whether to wear a top hat and mustache or his old uniform to show commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. He ultimately decided on wearing his old uniform and a fake mustache, which he purchased for the occasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. An "interview manager," presumed to be the [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]], called to confirm the appointment, seemingly unaware of Firrr's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

Upon arrival for the on-site interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, the front desk attendant appeared "unfazed" by his fake mustache, despite possibly having witnessed his prior termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Surprisingly, Firrr's phone was still connected to the company's Wi-Fi network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. He was asked to put on a face mask, which he did, over his mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### The Interview Process
Firrr's initial interview was with a [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] he hadn't met before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. His resume did not list his old jobs by name, instead using a "cut and paste" of the job listing description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. During the interview, the [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] was noted for being accommodating, offering snacks and water after Firrr mentioned skipping lunch due to nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. The interview took place in a different building from where he previously worked, minimizing the chance of running into old co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

The [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] confessed to not being technical enough to ask the "hard questions" and sought to bring in an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. While waiting for the engineer, the [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] continued to provide snacks, including a large bag of gummy bears and pretzels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

An engineer was brought in who recognized Firrr, asking if he had "freelanced" there before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Firrr responded by saying he freelanced "in a lot of places," which was technically not a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. The conversation went well because he was familiar with the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

Firrr then moved to the "old building" to meet the engineering team, collecting more snacks along the way, including a bag of beef jerky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### The Confrontation
Eventually, an engineer confronted Firrr, asking, "Are you here to really re-interview for your... interview for this job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a> Firrr feigned ignorance, stating he didn't understand the "re part" but wanted to know more about the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

The [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] returned, becoming furious that Firrr had not mentioned being fired from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. Firrr maintained that he "couldn't recall things changed so much," despite only two weeks passing since his termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. He offered the [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] a gummy bear, which was politely declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. It is assumed that Firrr was then asked to leave the premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

## Implications of the Incident
This incident highlights significant breakdowns in the company's [[improving_recruitment_processes | recruitment processes]]:

*   **[[recruitment_agency_oversights | Recruiter Oversights]]**: The recruiter contacted a recently terminated employee for the same position, suggesting a lack of internal communication or record-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **[[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | Hiring Manager Biases in Recruitment]]**: The [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] did not recognize the candidate's name, despite the termination occurring only two weeks prior, indicating a potential disconnect from the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Additionally, the [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]]'s lack of technical knowledge for the role being hired raises questions about effective performance management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
*   **[[miscommunication_in_hiring_teams | Miscommunication in Hiring Teams]]**: The overall process indicates severe [[miscommunication_in_hiring_teams | miscommunication within the hiring team]], where multiple interview rounds and hours passed before the company realized they were interviewing someone they had just fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.
*   **Company Size**: It was suggested that this might not be a large company, making the oversight even more perplexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   **[[experiences_of_former_employees_dealing_with_rehire_restrictions | Rehire Restrictions and Records]]**: The fact that the system allowed someone recently terminated to be brought back for an interview for the same job points to flaws in how former employees are flagged or restricted in the recruitment system.

The event, while humorous, underscores the critical need for improved internal communication and robust processes within [[the_role_of_recruitment_and_layoffs | recruitment and employment experience trends]] to prevent such embarrassing and inefficient situations.

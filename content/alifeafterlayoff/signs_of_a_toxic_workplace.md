Recognizing the language used by a company, both during interviews and within the workplace, can serve as significant "red flags" indicating a potentially [[toxic_work_environments | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. While not every company exhibiting these traits is necessarily a bad place to work, these are overarching [[toxic_workplace_indicators | things to look for in the workplace setting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Common Phrases Signifying a Toxic Environment

### "We work hard, we play hard."
This phrase often signals an expectation of excessively long and stressful hours, alongside potentially unattainable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The culture might be driven by fear and a "what have you done for me lately" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Incentives, like elaborate vacations or bonuses, are frequently dangled but difficult to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. "Play hard" celebrations are often scheduled outside of work hours or on weekends, without compensation, creating additional uncompensated work-related commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This type of environment can quickly become exhausting and wear thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### "We are family."
Often heard in smaller, privately owned companies, and sometimes even larger ones, this statement can be an unrealistic and insulting expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Employees are not actual family members, and expecting them to treat the company as such is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Such "family-run" environments can sometimes feel "cult-like" and off-putting, particularly if an employee doesn't share the same level of enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

### "We will promote you later, we promise."
If a promotion is promised verbally during an interview to secure a hire, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This often means the company either lacks the budget or is unwilling to pay what an employee is worth, using the promise as a "carrot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Without a written agreement, honoring such a promise becomes challenging, especially if the hiring manager leaves the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. For current employees, if a promised promotion continually shifts its target, it's a strong indicator that it's time to update your resume and seek opportunities elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Good companies value employees properly and don't play games with promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This points to [[challenges_with_job_promotions_in_toxic_companies | challenges with job promotions in toxic companies]].

### "You are replaceable."
When a company openly verbalizes this to employees, it signifies a fundamental lack of value for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Such environments often have strict guidelines and a constant, palpable fear of reprimand or immediate replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Working for a company that believes they can easily replace you means giving away all your power and living in fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. It's advisable to make yourself replaceable to them by finding a better job with a company that values your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### "We wear a lot of hats here" or "We're in startup mode."
In a company that claims "we wear a lot of hats here," an employee might be expected to perform multiple jobs outside their primary scope, often while being paid a lower salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. While some might enter this knowingly, high-quality companies typically ensure they have the right resources for specific roles, so employees shouldn't have to constantly juggle multiple responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

Similarly, if an established company (five to seven years old or more) still claims to be in "startup mode," it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. This is often used as an excuse to continue overworking employees and underpaying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

### "We only hire rock stars."
Often seen in job postings, this phrase can be a "cute" way to imply high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. However, if a company wants "the best of the best" but isn't willing to offer competitive compensation, it's a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Always check third-party review sites like Glassdoor for employee experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### "We are always hiring."
An established company that is "always hiring" for your position likely has a high turnover rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. While rapid growth can be an exception, consistent hiring in an established company suggests a "revolving door" of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. If interviewing with such a company, ask hard questions about turnover rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Promising a recall after a layoff.
Some companies lay off employees at the first sign of trouble, often despite claiming to be a "family environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. They might promise a recall when conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. However, accepting a recall means returning to an environment where the company has clearly demonstrated a lack of commitment to its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Like a "bad relationship," it's important to have self-respect and avoid returning to a company that has already shown it's not committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### Boasting about a foosball table.
This is often a superficial attempt to appear "trendy or hip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. If a company treats employees poorly, has a [[toxic_work_environments | toxic work environment]], and offers low pay, a foosball table doesn't negate the fact that it's a low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. It's like "putting lipstick on a pig" â€“ it's still a pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

Human Resources (HR) is a hotly debated subject, and many employees view it as an advocate on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, the speaker, with 20 years of experience in HR management and recruiting for both large and small companies, aims to dispel this myth and provide a broader perspective on HR's true function within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## HR as a Business Department
At its core, the human resources function is a business department, not a department primarily for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The term "human resources" is disliked by the speaker as it doesn't fully capture its strategic role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. HR departments originally formed 80 to 100 years ago as "personnel departments" to staff large corporations, with their primary purpose being to serve the business, not the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## HR's Hierarchical Functions

HR's functions operate on a hierarchical basis, with distinct priorities:

### 1. Primary Purpose: Risk Mitigation and Compliance
The ultimate driving mission of all HR departments is to mitigate risk, implement risk avoidance, and ensure compliance with legal requirements, keeping the company out of legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. When an employee reports an issue, HR is legally obligated to investigate and push it up the chain, as they become liable once aware of a potential risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This is why employees should be strategic about what they share with HR, especially when it's not a legal matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

### 2. Strategic Alignment to Business Decisions
The second tier of HR's purpose is to act as a strategic business partner to the most senior levels of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. HR is deeply aligned with the company's business strategy, with a Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) often sitting on the executive council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. HR engages in closed-door meetings with presidents, CEOs, and executive teams to contribute to the overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Their role at this level is to align the talent within the organization with the overall business strategy, ensuring the right people are in place to achieve the executive team's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### 3. Attracting, Developing, and Retaining Talent
The lowest tier of HR's purpose, which most people are familiar with, is to attract, develop, and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This includes functions like:
*   Recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Hiring and developing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>
*   Benefits administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>
*   Addressing issues like paychecks, benefits, time off, or harassment complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>

This is where the compassionate side of HR is typically found, often at the local employee level, where HR representatives genuinely aim to help employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Impact of Strategic Alignment on Employees
When business decisions are made at the strategic level, they can seem very calculated and cutthroat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. HR often receives a bad reputation because they are the deliverers of bad news, such as layoffs or adverse employment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

When a company reorganizes, an employee's position or contributions might no longer align with the new strategic direction, leading to a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. At this level, employees are often seen as data on a spreadsheet, and decisions are made based on business metrics and required skill sets, not personal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This coldness is a result of business-oriented decisions, not personal animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Taking Ownership of Your Career
Many people feel bitterness or anger towards HR after experiencing an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. While there are some HR professionals who might not be the best, the speaker emphasizes the importance of taking ownership of one's career and reflecting honestly on one's own contributions to a difficult situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. [[emotional_impact_of_hr_decisions_on_employees | Emotionally investing]] too heavily in a situation can lead to blaming others rather than learning from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

It is crucial for individuals to manage their own careers, viewing themselves as "free agents" rather than allowing organizations to steer them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. By understanding HR's true strategic function and its alignment with business goals, employees can better [[aligning_job_opportunities_with_career_goals | align job opportunities with career goals]] and prepare for situations where they might not be part of the company's strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Trusting a company to always do what's best for the individual can lead to disappointment when a business decision goes against personal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

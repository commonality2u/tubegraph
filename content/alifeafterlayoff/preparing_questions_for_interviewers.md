One common mistake candidates make during job interviews is failing to ask any questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This oversight can negatively impact a candidate's perception by the interviewing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Why Not Asking Questions is a Mistake
If a candidate goes through an entire interview process, meeting with various key stakeholders and the hiring manager, but has no questions, they may be perceived as disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Specifically, not inquiring about how their role contributes to the department's success or the specific objectives they would be working on can make a candidate appear uninterested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## The Interview is a Two-Way Street
It is crucial to remember that interviewing is a two-way street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Candidates should be interviewing the company just as much as the company is interviewing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. For those truly passionate about their career, it's important to be very selective in the roles they accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

It is beneficial to ask questions about the company culture to ensure it's the right fit on all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This demonstrates engagement and a desire to find a suitable long-term role.

## Benefits of Asking Questions

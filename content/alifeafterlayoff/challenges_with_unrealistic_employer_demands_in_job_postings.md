Job seekers often feel that [[Employer expectations vs reality | employer requirements are completely out of touch]] in today's market, and this perception is backed by evidence of "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These unstated demands, often more stringent than publicly listed criteria, create significant challenges for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The "Hidden Job Requirements" Leak

The concept of hidden job requirements came to light when a recruiter accidentally emailed a technical candidate their [[Employer strategies behind fake job listings | secret internal selection guidelines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These guidelines, provided by the hiring manager, are internal selection criteria not visible in the public job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Hiring managers develop a "wish list" for candidates, which includes both "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. While must-haves are usually clear (e.g., years of experience, core technical skills), the "prefers" often introduce hiring manager bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Recruiters are expected to push back on unrealistic demands to ensure a diverse candidate pool, but this often doesn't happen, especially with junior recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Examples of Unrealistic Demands

An accidentally shared internal memo for a software development role revealed the following specific and often extreme criteria:

### What Employers Are Looking For

### What to Avoid (Red Flags for Candidates)

*   Visa candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Career contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

*   Consulting background from IT software development firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   Experience limited solely to big companies like Uber or Intel, unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Candidates from "blacklisted" companies such as Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, and Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   [[Fake job postings and hiring practices | Fake profiles]] (though screening for these is a basic recruiter task) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers and the Market

The existence of such [[Overly demanding job application processes | Overly demanding job application processes]] and [[Absurd job requirements and red flags | Absurd job requirements and red flags]] can make getting a job feel impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Job seekers' frustration with these [[Challenges in the current job market | challenges]] is justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. These extensive wish lists make it difficult for recruiters to find qualified candidates, often leading to positions remaining open for extended periods because they will "never find a qualified candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

While the example cited is extreme, it reflects a common reality where companies have hidden requirements that candidates will never know about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Advice for Job Seekers

For job seekers feeling frustrated by [[Challenges of the current job market | current job market challenges]], it's important to remember that "it's them and not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Focus on presenting a clean, direct resume, engaging in targeted networking, and creating a GitHub or portfolio to showcase your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Ultimately, job seekers can reclaim control by choosing not to apply for jobs with such unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. If companies struggle to find candidates, they will be forced to adjust their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

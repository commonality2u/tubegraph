Many employees find themselves in a situation where they are unhappy at work, feeling unappreciated or underpaid, or having been passed up for a promotion. This can lead to seeking new opportunities and eventually receiving a job offer from another company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When informing their current employer of their departure, it's common for a counteroffer to be made, often including promises of a new job title or a larger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

However, according to a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, accepting a counteroffer is generally not advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Why You Should Never Accept a Counteroffer

While the decision to accept a new opportunity or a counteroffer can be stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, real-life experience and statistics suggest that accepting a counteroffer rarely leads to long-term satisfaction or stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Employee Retention After Counteroffers
Data from LinkedIn indicates that an overwhelming majority of people who accept counteroffers do not remain with their company long-term.
*   **80% or more** of individuals who accept counteroffers leave their company within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   A staggering **93%** won't be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

This highlights the [[risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | risks of accepting a counter offer]] and impacts [[employee_retention_statistics_postcounteroffer | employee retention statistics postcounteroffer]].

### Underlying Issues Persist
One of the primary [[reasons_to_decline_a_counter_offer | reasons to decline a counter offer]] is that the initial problems that prompted the job search will likely still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   A bad boss will remain a bad boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Poor company culture will not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Work-life balance issues will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Commute problems and terrible benefits are unlikely to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Overall business stability and rough patches within the company are also unlikely to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Even if a promotion or new boss is part of the counteroffer, you may still need to work alongside the old boss whom you effectively threatened to quit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### The Company's Perspective and Changed Relationships
When a company offers a counteroffer, it raises several questions about their previous actions and future intentions:
*   **Why now?** The counteroffer often appears only after an employee decides to leave, suggesting the company was previously undervaluing or taking advantage of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Buying Time:** Companies may offer a counter to buy themselves time to find a replacement and create a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. By broadcasting your intention to leave, you inadvertently make yourself redundant in the company's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Changed Relationships:** Your relationships with colleagues and senior leaders may not be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. You may be labeled as someone not long-term committed to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Layoff Risk:** If the company faces financial difficulties, employees who have shown dissatisfaction, especially those with higher salaries due to a counteroffer, may be among the first considered for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Impact on Career Progression
Accepting a counteroffer can negatively impact your [[negotiating_job_offers_and_career_advancement_strategies | negotiating job offers and career advancement strategies]] and long-term career prospects within the company:
*   **Previous Undervaluation:** If you received a higher salary or promotion only after threatening to leave, it implies you were either not paid correctly or your skills were undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Stagnation:** Employees who are highly effective in their current role might be locked into it, as management doesn't want to lose their productivity in that specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Missed Promotions:** If you were previously passed over for a promotion, why did it take threatening to leave for the company to finally recognize your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>? Senior leaders may believe you are not as dedicated as you once were and pass on you for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This impacts [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_advancement | the impact of company loyalty on career advancement]].
*   **Temporary Fixes:** Often, a promised role or improved conditions are merely to keep you happy temporarily, leading to a "honeymoon period" that eventually wears off, bringing back the original issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

> [!example] Real-life Anecdote
> A candidate, while driving cross-country in a moving truck for a new job, accepted a counteroffer from their previous employer and returned home. Less than six months later, they called the recruiter, admitting that accepting the counteroffer was a big mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

When [[evaluating_counteroffers | evaluating counteroffers]], it's crucial to remember that accepting one is often like an old relationship: "look back on it fondly, but remember that it ended for a reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. You should be selfish with your career, as no one else will look out for your best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Leaving a bad boss, poor work culture, or a dying industry is not just the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Staying too long at one job can have [[consequences_of_staying_too_long_at_one_job | consequences of staying too long at one job]], especially if the environment is detrimental.

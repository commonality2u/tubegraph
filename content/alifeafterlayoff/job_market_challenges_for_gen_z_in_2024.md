The current job market presents significant [[challenges_gen_z_workers_face_in_the_workplace | challenges for Gen Z workers]], particularly those in the early stages of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many recent graduates and entry-level job seekers face a landscape characterized by high application volumes, prolonged interview processes, and a disconnect between perceived and actual job availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## The Gen Z Job Seeker's Experience

A viral TikTok video by "hunter.howard9" (the moderate) highlighted the frustrations of a job seeker who applied to 1,600 jobs and received only one "relatively crappy" offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This individual, in his last semester of college with a business degree, described several common pain points:

### Perceived "Job Market Disaster"
The TikToker asserts that the United States is currently experiencing a "job market disaster" or crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He aims to "expose" hiring managers, hiring practices, and companies for "the games they're playing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Companies Posting "Urgently Hiring" Jobs
Companies frequently post jobs as "urgently hiring" but then reject all applicants and repost the same job one to two months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:02:03]</a>. One theory suggests companies might be profiting from this practice, though the mechanism is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Excessive Interview Rounds and Ghosting
Job seekers often undergo multiple interview rounds, sometimes four or more, only to be rejected without explanation or receive no response at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:49]</a>. This can involve two weeks or more invested in a single company's process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Quality of Job Offers
Out of 1,600 applications, the TikToker received only one salaried job offer for $41,000 a year selling phones in Costco, which he rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:03:04]</a>. He also received three 1099 (commission-only) positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:15]</a>. Thousands of other applications resulted in rejection, being "played with" through interviews, or never hearing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Devaluation of College Education
The job seeker expressed frustration that companies do not seem to care about his business degree, prioritizing work experience instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:40]</a>. He suggests that current college students consider dropping out based on his experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Extensive Job Search Efforts
He claims to have tried "everything," including applying online, calling companies, attending job fairs, and even visiting businesses in person for minimum wage positions, only to be told to apply online and then be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Expert Analysis of the Job Market
Brian, from Life After Layoff, provides commentary on these experiences, agreeing with some points while offering alternative perspectives and advice.

### Discrepancy in Job Market Reporting
Despite news reports suggesting a "great job market" with strong performance and abundant job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:53]</a>, job seekers on the front lines are not experiencing the same reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:59]</a>. The numbers may be "cooked" to appear better than they are, especially with an election approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:10]</a>. Misleading figures include people holding multiple jobs, being underemployed, or working part-time/contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:21]</a>. Many companies have replaced full-time roles with lower-paying, benefit-less part-time or contract roles, which still count in job data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Reasons for Reposting Jobs
Companies may repost job listings for several reasons, suggesting some of the [[current_job_market_challenges | current job market challenges]]:
*   **Lack of Good Candidates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Overly Picky Hiring Managers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Red Flag Employers** who have high turnover or make lowball offers that are declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Ghost Jobs** (evergreen requisitions) where employers collect candidates for future hiring events without immediate openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:13]</a>. Recruiters also dislike ghost jobs, as they waste everyone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Companies do not directly profit from collecting application data** and selling it to third parties like Equifax is usually inadvertent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:14]</a>. More likely, it's a sign of bad hiring processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Critique of "Spray and Pray" Application Strategy
Applying to 1,600 jobs indicates a "throwing mud against the wall" approach, casting an "extremely wide net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:21]</a>. While entry-level candidates do need to cast a wider net, such a high volume suggests a lack of targeted effort and a confusing marketing message to hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:54]</a>. It's improbable a candidate is a good fit for all 1,600 positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:07:02]</a>. This strategy results in low response rates (less than 1%) and is often facilitated by "easy apply" buttons, which are "good for getting easy rejections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Interview Process Length
For entry-level positions, four rounds of interviewing are generally considered excessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:52]</a>. Typically, an entry-level process involves a recruiter screen and a panel interview (one or two main rounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:42]</a>. A third interview might occur in rare cases for remote placements or specific technical needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:22]</a>. However, for experienced salaried roles, four rounds (recruiter screen, hiring manager, panel, checkoff interview with senior leader) are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:13:08]</a>. Navigating multiple interviews within two weeks is actually impressive due to scheduling complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Challenges with Low-Quality Offers
The $41,000 Costco sales job is considered low-quality and not relevant for someone with a business degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:14:11]</a>. The 1099 (commission-only) positions indicate non-committal, high-turnover employers who avoid paying benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:15:00]</a>. This often attracts low-quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:03]</a>. The first job is generally the hardest to secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Ghosting After Applications/Interviews
After an application, candidates should at least receive an automated rejection email from the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:11]</a>. If a candidate has physically spoken to someone in a formal interview process (recruiter, hiring manager, panel), a more personalized rejection is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:16:07]</a>.

### Importance of Experience Over Degree
Business degrees are often seen as "generic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:40]</a>. What truly differentiates a candidate is relevant experience through internships, co-ops, or part-time jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:18:02]</a>. Employers target candidates with internship experience because they are less risky hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:13]</a>. Candidates with multiple internships, especially with well-known companies, have a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:42]</a>.
A college degree serves as a qualifier, but it does not differentiate a candidate, as many others will have the same degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:31]</a>. Good employers have thousands of candidates to choose from, prioritizing those with internships, high GPAs, and student leadership involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:20:15]</a>. Many interns are converted to full-time roles before graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:22]</a>.

### Strategic Job Search Advice for Gen Z
To navigate these [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | challenges in the current job market]], Gen Z job seekers should:
*   **Be Targeted:** Avoid the "spray and pray" method. Identify the specific problem you solve for an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Gain Experience Early:** Prioritize co-ops and internships starting as early as sophomore year to gain demonstrated experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:12]</a>. If already deep in college without internships, seek summer internships through networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:52]</a>.
*   **Differentiate Yourself:** In a competitive market with thousands of candidates, having a degree is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:37]</a>. What makes you unique? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:12]</a> Clearly articulate your value to hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:14]</a>.
*   **Optimize Your Resume:** If you're qualified but not getting calls, it's often a resume issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:14]</a>.
*   **Leverage LinkedIn:** Learn how to get noticed by recruiters so they come to you, potentially skipping the traditional application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:24:08]</a>.

Setting up a strategic approach early in one's career can lead to a stronger career path and help avoid frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:34]</a>.

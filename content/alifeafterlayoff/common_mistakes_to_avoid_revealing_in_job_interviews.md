After landing a job interview, it's crucial to perform exceptionally to avoid [[common_interview_mistakes | common interview mistakes]] that could lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Interviewing can be like navigating a minefield, where one wrong step can land you in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Information to Withhold in Job Interviews

### 1. Too Many Personal Facts / Oversharing

Avoid revealing excessive personal details about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This often indicates nervousness or being long-winded, neither of which are desirable traits when trying to impress an interview team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Being long-winded can suggest a lack of emotional intelligence or a tendency to [[impact_of_oversharing_personal_information_in_interviews | overshare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Employers connect your ability to articulate clearly with your potential performance in a business setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Keep interview answers concise, ideally two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. If you tend to overshare due to nervousness, practice more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Sharing too much personal information also carries the risk of bias from the interviewer, either for or against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While a shared interest might create an icebreaker, it's generally best to keep discussions strictly job-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### 2. The Real, Negative Reason for Leaving Your Previous Employer

While honesty is valued, you don't need to disclose the full truth about why you're leaving your current job, especially if the reasons are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This includes escaping a boring employer, disliking a boss, or feeling poorly treated by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

How you frame your departure will be judged by the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. For example:
*   **Complaining about a terrible boss** might be heard as "you're difficult to work with" or "you could be a problem for us," which is a [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Stating you were bored or unchallenged** might suggest to an employer that you lack initiative to find more enriching work yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Figure out the true reason for your departure and articulate it in a way that doesn't sound threatening or negative to a potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### 3. Oversharing Your Career Plans (Especially if Unrelated)

When asked about your career plans, such as "Where do you see yourself in five years?", employers are looking for commitment to the career path and the potential for growth within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Divulging plans to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely after a few years is generally not viewed positively and can be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This indicates a lack of passion for the type of work you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. You must convey a level of passion for the role to make a hiring manager feel good about your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If you have such plans, strategize how to message them carefully in interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### 4. Desperation for a Job

Avoid revealing that you are desperate for a job, perhaps due to a layoff or firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. While you may have a sense of urgency, an employer will hear "desperate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Similar to dating, high urgency can push the desired outcome further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Even in difficult financial situations, you must appear calm and collected to avoid being put into the "no" bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### 5. Your Age or How Many Years You Have Left in the Workforce

Be cautious about revealing your age, whether directly or inadvertently through your resume or email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Both being perceived as too young or too old can lead to age discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Ensure your resume doesn't include outdated information like fax numbers, which can indicate you're out of touch with the current job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Similarly, avoid indicating how many years you have left in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Common for those nearing retirement, phrases like "I just want to land this last job" or "put in 10 good years" can become a liability to the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If a hiring manager expects a long-term commitment (e.g., 10+ years) for a role designed for growth, revealing plans for only three to five years can create a bias against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### 6. Major Medical Issues, Disabilities, or Pregnancy

Unless a major medical issue prohibits you from meeting the basic job requirements, generally do not reveal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Employers should ask during the application process if you can meet the requirements of the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. If asked directly by a recruiter, you should be truthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Employers cannot legally discriminate based on pregnancy or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. If you have a disability that doesn't interfere with job performance, it's not recommended to bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. If a reasonable accommodation is required, it should be indicated in the application or when asked by the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. For high-functioning disabilities where accommodation might be needed, the time to discuss it is typically at the offer stage, not during the interview, to prevent inadvertent bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. You are hired for your ability to perform the job based on the requirements of the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### 7. Your Political Belief System

Avoid revealing your political belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. While you might feel aligned with a company's mission or a hiring manager's viewpoints, the political spectrum is wide and often heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. It's best to stay completely out of it, as you can never be certain of the interviewer's beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### 8. Your Previous Salary

Do not reveal your previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This question usually arises during the recruiter phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Disclosing it can lock you into a salary that might be lower than what you deserve, especially if you were previously underpaid compared to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Determine Your Worth**: You, as the employee, should determine your worth based on the open market's value for your skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Prevent Undervaluation**: You don't want an employer to determine your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

By being mindful of these points, you can navigate job interviews more effectively and increase your chances of success.

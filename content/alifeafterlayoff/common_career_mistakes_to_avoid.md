Everyone is likely to make career mistakes at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article, based on insights from a corporate recruiter and career coach, highlights six common career mistakes that people often learn the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These insights come from the speaker's own past experiences and observations from coaching calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Six Career Mistakes

### 1. Not Realizing a Critical Mistake Until Years Later
The biggest lesson often learned too late is realizing a critical mistake made earlier in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Examples of such mistakes include:
*   Staying in a job for too long or "overstaying your welcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Not responding to a recruiter for an amazing job opportunity due to fear or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Accepting a job offer that wasn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Moving to a part of the country that wasn't ideal, or conversely, not moving when it could have led to a new career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Focusing too long on a specific job type or career vertical, only to realize later it wasn't resonating, making a change much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

It's common for career coaches to pinpoint where someone "went off the rails" in their career when they express unhappiness or feeling stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### 2. Loyalty Rarely Pays Off
Many people learn the hard way that loyalty to a company or leader rarely results in significant career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. An example shared is staying in a role for years expecting a promotion that never came, while the market moved beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This can lead to being stuck years behind peers in terms of responsibility, level, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### 3. Hard Work Does Not Lead to Promotions (Smart Work Does)
Putting in long hours and paying your dues often only results in the "dangling carrot" of promotion being pushed further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Working for a "workaholic boss" can create pressure to match their hours, but this does not guarantee promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Instead of working the most hours, focus on working the smartest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This means working on projects that your boss and your boss's boss care about, as these are the highly visible projects that get you promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### 4. Not Advocating for Yourself
Part of the "game" of career progression is advocating for yourself to the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Your boss often isn't the decision-maker for promotions; it's usually your boss's boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to find ways to be visible to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. You must be your own advocate because no one else in the organization will do it for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Consider yourself the "CEO of your career," meaning you must wear multiple hats, including that of your own marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This involves marketing your effectiveness within your company, department, and job, as well as on the open market during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### 5. Focusing on Specific Skills Over Relevant, In-Demand Skills
While being very good at a specific thing can be a competitive advantage, *relevant skills* matter more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Employers value certain skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. If your skills become irrelevant, you can find yourself with a resume full of skills nobody cares about anymore, leading to panic and settling for lower-quality jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This can create serious [[common_mistakes_in_resume_writing | resume issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The key is to focus on relevant skills that are highly in demand by *more than one* employer, not just your specific one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### 6. You're Only As Good As What You've Done Lately
This is a particularly painful lesson, especially relevant during periods of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. While past achievements and "goodwill" might buy you some time, the reality is that if employers don't feel you're contributing anymore, or don't have future plans for your skills, you could be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Goodwill is typically short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Senior leaders primarily care about what you can produce tomorrow, not just what you produced yesterday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Taking Control of Your Career

To avoid these pitfalls, it's essential to act like the "free agent" of your career and always look out for yourself first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This means reclaiming control, approaching your career with strategy, and taking ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. By being mindful of these common mistakes, you can potentially avoid a lot of pain in your career journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

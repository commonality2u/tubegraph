## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Not Allowing Contact
LinkedIn operates with two main interfaces: the familiar front-facing site and "[[The impact of LinkedIn on the job market | LinkedIn Recruiter]]," a back-channel used by recruiters to search the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Recruiters can search profiles using keywords and boolean searches to find specific combinations of skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The most frustrating scenario for a recruiter is finding a perfect candidate but being unable to contact them because they have blocked connections from people they don't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

If you are an active job seeker or want opportunities to come your way, not [[Importance of allowing contact on LinkedIn | allowing recruiters to contact you]] means you are [[Networking and job searching tips | potentially missing out on great options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Even if you're a "passive candidate" (not actively looking for a job), it's still [[Importance of allowing contact on LinkedIn | worth allowing people to contact you]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. While you might receive some unwanted emails, it takes only seconds to disregard them, and you might miss out on a significant [[Networking and job searching tips | career opportunity]] if you're not contactable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Receiving recruiter emails indicates you are in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Therefore, [[Importance of allowing contact on LinkedIn | keep your contact options open]], especially when looking for new [[Networking and job searching tips | career opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Keywords
Recruiters use "boolean searching," an advanced search strategy that involves strings of keywords, to find very specific profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. If your [[Networking and job searching tips | LinkedIn profile]] lacks these specific keywords, you won't appear in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   **Tip**: Load your [[Networking and job searching tips | LinkedIn profile]] with all the keywords a recruiter in your industry might be searching for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Stay informed about the major skills and common terms used in your industry and include them if you possess those skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The more keywords you include, the more likely recruiters are to find and contact you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### 3. Inactivity
Having a great profile with keywords and open contact options is ineffective if you are not active on LinkedIn to check messages or notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

*   **Tip**: Be active on the platform. Keep a pulse on what's happening and check your messages occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Set up notifications for direct emails to an email address you regularly check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. You can adjust settings to receive only important emails, not every network notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: Being active means you'll see opportunities posted by your network, including high-quality positions recruiters share in their feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. It's a great way to stay informed about your industry and build your professional presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### 4. Limited Network
Many users have fewer than 100 connections, which suggests they are not very active or don't have a robust network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. LinkedIn is a defined professional network, and there's a very high limit on connections (e.g., 35,000 to 50,000), so there's no reason not to expand yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **Tip**: Actively build your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   Start by connecting with previous employers, colleagues, and bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   Expand to local industry professionals, people in similar roles, and similar companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. These targeted connections often lead to direct opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Aim to increase your connections to at least "500+" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, as this number on your profile suggests you are more active and invested in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### 5. Being a "Lurker" (Not Engaging)
Being on LinkedIn but never engaging with posts or creating your own content means your name won't be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. A large network is meaningless if you don't engage with it, as it prevents you from building your personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

*   **Tip**: Engage actively by leaving thoughtful comments and creating valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This builds your employment brand, making recruiters more likely to notice you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Actionable Steps**:
    *   Start by engaging with one post a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
    *   Aim to put out one to three posts of your own content per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
    *   Consistency is key, and you may be surprised by the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Recruiters, who are on LinkedIn constantly, will notice your consistent presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### 6. Engaging in Controversial Discussions
When building your employment brand through engagement, avoid getting involved in controversial discussions, especially political, religious, or non-work-related belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Arguing with strangers can be seen by hundreds of thousands of people in your network and their extended networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

*   **Warning**: This reflects poorly on your brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Recruiters may judge your professionalism, regardless of whether they agree with your opinion, and question if you would behave similarly in an office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Tip**: Keep your LinkedIn interactions work-related, professional, and "above the cuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

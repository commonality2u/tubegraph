Understanding the signs that your job might be "on the rocks" can help you prepare a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. These indicators are based on over 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting functions within major corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## Performance-Related Indicators

Several signs directly relate to your performance and output within the company:

### Declining Metrics
If your work metrics are significantly lower compared to your co-workers, it's a leading indicator of potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. In major corporations, departments often publish metrics like sales quotas or other measurable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. If your productivity consistently lags behind your peer group, your name may appear on a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This underperformance will likely attract attention from both your direct boss and their superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Boss's Displeasure
A sudden shift where your boss becomes displeased with your work is a significant sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. It's crucial to identify what isn't meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Being proactive, meeting with your boss, and seeking clarification on expectations or support can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Continually displeasing your boss can put a target on your back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Work Redistribution
If your responsibilities, such as clients or projects you previously managed, are being taken away or you're no longer involved, it indicates that management has lost faith in your ability to perform the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Exclusion from Key Discussions
No longer being invited to important discussions or meetings that you once attended is a negative sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. If your boss starts taking your place in meetings with groups you used to support, it's likely they are doing damage control or trying to distance you from the project or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### "Weirdness" from Other Groups
Noticing strange behavior from cross-functional groups you support, such as their leaders acting odd or withholding information, can be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Formal Documentation and Processes

These signs often involve official company procedures designed to address performance issues:

### Drastically Lower Performance Appraisals
A sudden, unexpected, and critical drop in your performance appraisal scores, especially if you previously had decent scores, is a serious warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This often indicates that your manager is beginning to document your potential dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. From an HR perspective, managers are often instructed to create a "paper trail" of documented coaching sessions and performance declines to limit liability before an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Performance Improvement Process (PIP)
Being placed on a Performance Improvement Process (PIP) is considered a major [[Signs of a red flag job candidate | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. A PIP is a defined period with measurable goals that must be met to keep your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. If you fail to meet these defined metrics by the end of the PIP, termination is the typical outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. However, if you take the PIP seriously and improve your performance, you can successfully come off it and remain in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

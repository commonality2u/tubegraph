It is based on insights from an individual with 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting functions for major corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Recognizing these [[signs_youre_about_to_get_fired | signs that you might be getting fired]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> can prompt you to consider a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Key Indicators

### Declining Metrics

A primary indicator of poor performance is when your metrics are significantly lower, especially compared to your co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Most major corporations publish departmental metrics, such as sales quotas or other measurable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If your productivity consistently lags behind your peer group, your performance is likely being noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This can lead to increased scrutiny from your direct manager and their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Boss's Displeasure

A sudden dissatisfaction from your boss regarding your work is a significant warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It's crucial to proactively engage with your boss to understand expectations better and seek support, as continuous displeasure can put a target on your back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Work Redistribution

If your work is being redistributed, it's a strong sign that management has lost faith in your ability to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This includes being pulled off clients you used to support or removed from projects you were involved with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Exclusion from Key Discussions

Not being invited to key discussions or meetings you previously attended is a negative sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If your boss starts attending meetings in your place, it indicates they are either doing damage control or distancing you from the project or team you supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### "Weirdness" from Supporting Groups

Noticing strange behavior from cross-functional leaders or groups you support, such as them being reluctant to share information, can signal underlying issues with your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Declining Performance Appraisals

A drastic slip in your performance appraisals, especially if unexpected, is a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Managers often start documenting performance issues to prepare for a potential dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. From an HR perspective, this documentation, including documented coaching sessions, creates a "paper trail" to defend adverse employment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

Being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a serious sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A PIP is a defined period with measurable goals that must be met to retain your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Failure to meet these specific metrics typically results in termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While it's possible to successfully complete a PIP and improve your performance, being put on one is a "huge red flag" that should be taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

If you observe any of these indicators, it's advisable to consider your next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Whether you choose to address the performance issues directly or seek a new opportunity, taking concerted effort and action is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

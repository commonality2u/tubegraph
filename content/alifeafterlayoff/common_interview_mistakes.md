As a recruiter and human resources professional with two decades of experience, having hired thousands of people into prestigious companies, insights into why candidates succeed or fail are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Bringing your "A game" to an interview is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The following are battle-tested tips directly from employers, helping you identify and correct potential missteps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Five Common Mistakes in Interviews

### 1. Talking Too Much
The most common mistake is providing excessively long answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This often stems from nerves or a misunderstanding of the question, and can suggest a lack of emotional intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **Impact**: When a candidate rambles, they often drift into unrelated stories and may fail to answer the original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This shows a poor understanding of what the interviewer is seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Every question has a specific purpose to assess your background against the job profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Solution**:
    *   If unsure what's being asked, it's better to pause and clarify the question with the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This demonstrates self-awareness and business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   Provide thorough yet concise answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Interviewers can ask probing questions for more detail if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### 2. Not Being Prepared
Lack of preparation manifests in various ways and creates a poor first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

*   **Examples of Unpreparedness**: Not reading the job description, not visiting the company website, or not knowing the interviewer's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This suggests you don't take the job, your career, or the opportunity seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Showing up completely unprepared will almost guarantee you don't get the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. It's better to reschedule than attend unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Do your research: visit the company website, check the careers section, review the job posting, and look up Glassdoor reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This shows engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   Prepare for interview questions, especially those related to core competencies and behavior-based scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Think of relevant experiences to draw from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### 3. Being Over-Prepared
While preparation is key, excessive preparation can be detrimental, leading to a robotic and inauthentic presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

*   **Impact**: Reciting a "book report" of obscure company data isn't necessarily impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Being overly rehearsed can make you trip up if anything deviates from your script, making you appear nervous and inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Some rehearsing is encouraged, but too much is a bad thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   Think of your career as a series of "story arcs" â€“ major experiences you can pull from to answer various questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   Authenticity is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. If you've truly done what you describe, you should be able to speak about it with passion and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### 4. Not Being Enthusiastic Enough
A lack of enthusiasm can make it seem like you don't genuinely want the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

*   **Impact**: Hiring managers prefer candidates who are energetic and excited about the opportunity, as enthusiasm is infectious and contributes to a positive team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Appearing bored or uninterested will hinder your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Solution**: If enthusiasm doesn't come naturally, practice in front of a mirror to work on your energy level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### 5. Not Asking Any Questions
Failing to ask questions at the end of an interview signals a lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

*   **Impact**: If you don't ask about how your role contributes to department success or specific objectives, interviewers may view you as disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Interviewing is a two-way street; you should be interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you to ensure it's the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Come prepared with good questions for the hiring team and manager, focusing on company culture, team dynamics, and how your role aligns with broader objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This demonstrates engagement and impresses the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

If you've made these [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | mistakes]] in the past, don't fret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Reflect on what you can tweak with strategy and planning to finally land your dream job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

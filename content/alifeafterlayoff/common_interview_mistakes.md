> "These are tried and true and battle tested tips that come directly from the employer's mouth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

## 1. Talking Too Much

One of the most common [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_job_interviews | mistakes]] candidates make is talking too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This often stems from nerves or a misunderstanding of the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It can also suggest a lack of emotional intelligence, where the candidate cannot properly gauge the interviewer's emotions or cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

When a candidate rambles, they often branch off into unrelated stories and fail to answer the original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Interviewers ask questions with a "specific and meaningful purpose" to understand certain aspects of your background related to the job profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

[!TIP]
Instead of guessing or rambling, it's better to pause and ask for clarification, such as: "I think that you're asking me about this, but can you clarify? I just want to make sure that I'm giving you the right information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
This shows self-awareness and business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Interviewers are generally happy to clarify and are not trying to "trap" you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

It is generally better to provide a thorough yet concise answer, rather than too much detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A skilled interviewer will ask probing questions if more information is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## 2. Not Being Prepared

Lack of preparation is a major [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_job_interviews | mistake]] that manifests in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Showing up to an interview without having read the job description, visited the company website, or knowing the interviewer's name creates a poor first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This signals a lack of seriousness about the job, your career, or the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

An unprepared candidate also reflects poorly on the recruiter who sent them to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. It is "almost never" possible to get the position if you are completely unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

[!WARNING]
It's better to reschedule the interview than to show up unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### How to Prepare:
*   **Research the company:** Visit their website, especially the careers section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Review the job posting:** Understand the specifics of the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Check Glassdoor reviews:** Get insights into company culture and interview processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Anticipate questions:** Prepare for questions about core competencies, often in a behavior-based interview format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Think of scenarios from your background that can be applied to various competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## 3. Being Over-Prepared

While preparation is crucial, being *over-prepared* can also be a [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_job_interviews | mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Reciting obscure company data or acting too rehearsed can make you seem robotic and inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. If anything deviates from your script, you might trip up, become nervous, and appear like a "deer in headlights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

> "Authenticity is the key and if you've truly done the things that you're talking about, you should be able to speak in depth about them with a level of passion and knowledge." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

Think of selling yourself as a series of "story arcs" from your career that you can pull from to answer questions naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Some rehearsing is encouraged, but too much is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## 4. Not Being Enthusiastic Enough

Coming into an interview with low energy and no enthusiasm for the position can make it appear that you don't really want the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Hiring managers prefer candidates who are energetic and excited about the opportunity, as enthusiasm is "infectious" and contributes to a positive team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. They want to be surrounded by positive, upbeat people ready to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

If you are an introvert and enthusiasm doesn't come naturally, practice in front of a mirror to work on your energy level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## 5. Not Asking Any Questions

After going through the entire interviewing process and meeting various stakeholders, not asking any questions about the role's contribution, objectives, or department specifics makes you appear disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

[!INFO]
Interviewing is a "two-way street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. You should be interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

If you are passionate about your career, you should be very selective about the roles you accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Come prepared with good questions for the hiring teams and your hiring manager, especially regarding the company culture, to ensure it's the right fit for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This will impress the teams and show them you could be a very engaged employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

If you've made these [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_job_interviews | mistakes]] in the past, reflect on them and strategize how to change your approach going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. With strategy and planning, you can land your dream job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

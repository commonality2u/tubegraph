Layoffs carry a significant and often unseen cost to an individual's career momentum [00:09:40]. This impact may not be immediately apparent, often taking a year or two to fully manifest [00:09:48]. This is particularly true for individuals who have been employed by a single company for an extended period [00:09:55].

## Loss of Skills and Market Value
Individuals might have achieved a high-paying, senior position and become comfortable, expecting to easily transition to a similar role elsewhere due to their extensive work history [00:09:59]. However, upon entering the open market, they may discover that the [[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | skills]], knowledge, and experience developed over time are not valued in the same way by other companies [00:10:17]. If these [[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | skills]] or job functions were still highly valued, the previous company likely would not have initiated the layoff [00:10:30]. This can lead to significant struggle, especially for [[Impact of layoffs on latecareer professionals | late-career professionals]] in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, who may find themselves unable to regain their previous career standing [00:10:38]. They might become "invisible" to employers, with their [[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | skill sets]] seemingly irrelevant [00:10:48].

## Rebuilding Relationships and Internal Equity
Beyond the devaluation of [[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | skills]], the momentum built up over a career can be abruptly lost [00:11:07]. When joining a new company, individuals must rebuild professional relationships and internal equity from scratch [00:11:12]. This includes familiarizing themselves with colleagues, and establishing a reputation, which takes considerable time to develop [00:11:17]. Without a careful career strategy, it's easy to lose all momentum, even after securing new employment [00:11:43]. A single, poorly timed layoff can completely derail a promising career [00:11:52].

## Impact on Compensation
A significant hidden cost is the [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | impact on compensation]] [00:11:59]. Salaries achieved within a specific company or for a particular job type might not be realistic outside that context, especially if the job is not in high demand [00:12:02]. Many individuals face a substantial pay cut in the open market [00:12:16]. While some may upgrade their situation, many struggle to return to their previous earning levels [00:12:35]. This compensation reduction extends beyond base salary to bonuses (e.g., a 10% bonus on a significantly lower salary) [00:12:44] and 401K contributions, which also become smaller [00:12:58]. This financial impact can have a cascading and rippling effect throughout the remainder of one's career [00:13:04].

## Mitigating the Impact
To minimize the devastating [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | impact of layoffs]], individuals should actively plan for contingencies [00:03:36]. This involves conducting a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of their organization, job type, and personal career safety [00:16:41]. Taking precautions to become a more marketable candidate is crucial [00:16:55]. Building multiple streams of income is also highly recommended, as it can alleviate many of the financial pressures associated with layoffs [00:17:04]. Having diverse income sources provides the freedom to be selective about future job opportunities, avoiding the need to accept ill-fitting roles due to financial desperation [00:17:19]. It also prevents the need to prematurely access retirement savings like a 401K [00:17:29].

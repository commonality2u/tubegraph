> The salary data presented in this article is self-reported on Reddit, which is considered the "wild west of the internet." Readers should take these figures with a "grain of salt" as they cannot be independently confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Efforts were made to filter for positions seemingly from North America, specifically the United States, and those that appeared legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

This article shares actual self-reported salaries to provide data points for those considering different [[alternative_career_paths_and_job_options | career paths]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

    *   Annual Salary: $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: Jobs are not abundant, and significant time is spent on the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Conductors typically work territories rather than cross-country routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

    *   Annual Salary: $95,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

## Technology and Sales Roles

*   **Software Sales**
    *   Base Salary: $110,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

*   **Software Engineer**
    *   Annual Salary: $133,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: This base salary is considered relatively low for a seasoned software engineer, with typical bases ranging from $150,000 to $170,000 for a reasonable-sized company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Total compensation can be much higher with significant bonuses and stock incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Healthcare and Public Service

    *   Considerations: This profession has "absolutely exploded" in recent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Assignments are typically 13 weeks, and nurses can choose their locations and work times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. It is a high-stress, high-burnout, and nomadic job, but highly lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. For those interested in retooling and the nursing profession, travel nursing is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

## Unique and Niche Professions

*   **Bridge Operator**
    *   Annual Salary: $35,000-$40,000, depending on overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: Offers enough to pay bills and live comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

Most time is spent indoors, away from cold and heat, and often alone without a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Car Sales**
    *   Annual Salary: $30,000 - $120,000, depending on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: The current market (as of the video) sees cars "selling themselves" due to shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. A strong stomach is needed for the wide swings in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, and saving money for lean years is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   **Dog Walker / Pet Sitter / Gal Friday**
    *   Hourly Wage: $25 - $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
    *   Annual Equivalent: Averages $75,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: Low stress, flexible hours with plenty of free time for appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. No real benefits provided, so these must be paid out of profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. This job is especially lucrative when operating as one's own business, potentially turning a side hustle into a full-time income with proper setup (e.g., insurance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Museum Security Guard**
    *   Hourly Wage: $29.50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

*   **Corporate Development**
    *   Annual Salary: $350,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: The exact duties for this role are unclear, but it implies a high-level position like a director or senior director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.
*   **Options Investor**
    *   Annual Income: $125,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: The sky is the limit for traders who know what they're doing, but it's possible to lose money very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. Entering this field requires eyes wide open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

    *   Hourly Wage: $34.23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

    *   Considerations: The pension is particularly noteworthy as they are "unheard of these days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. Six weeks vacation suggests this person has been with USPS for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.

## Careers with Lower Earning Potential (or High Risk)

*   **Minor League Baseball Player**
    *   Monthly Pay: $2,000 for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: There is no guarantee of moving into the major leagues, and the percentage of players who make it is "astronomically small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. Having a Plan B is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.
*   **Animator (Video Games)**
    *   Hourly Wage: $28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: Compared to video game bug testing, animation seems less lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.
*   **Social Worker**
    *   Annual Salary: $46,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.
    *   Considerations: This profession is often described as a calling or passion rather than a pursuit for high income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. Not-for-profit and social work industries generally pay less than fields like software development and tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. Supplementing income with [[contract_positions_for_skill_development_and_industry_transition | side hustles]] is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

As a recruiter and career coach, the goal of a resume is to capture the attention of the screener quickly to secure a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Recruiters typically give resumes a five-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While there's no single "right" way to write a resume, the litmus test is whether it yields the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The following tips are provided from a corporate recruiter's viewpoint, incorporating feedback from hiring managers on how they screen resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Template Selection and ATS Compliance

*   **Avoid Outdated Templates**: Steer clear of templates designed by graphic designers, often found on sites like Canva.com or large resume hubs, which feature graphics, charts, and "cute presentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These elements distract from the main purpose of quickly finding information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Opt for Simplicity**: It's recommended to use a simple Microsoft Word template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Design Guidelines**:
    *   Choose a single-column layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Avoid bright, flashy colors and excessive graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   Use clean, easy-to-read fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   Stick to basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For most roles, a resume should be "relatively boring" in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   *Exception*: If you are a graphic designer or in a creative field where a unique resume is expected, a more creative approach might be suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, even then, avoid templates designed by other graphic designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**: Graphic designer templates often fail to be effective because they are not designed with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   **Contact Information**: Ensure your contact information is vertical, not horizontal, as ATS systems typically do not read horizontal layouts well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   **ATS Compliance Test**: If you find yourself manually entering your name, phone number, and address when applying, your resume may not be ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Content and Customization

*   **Profiling vs. Summarizing**: Instead of writing a summary of your entire career, which hopes employers will find what they like, focus on "profiling" for a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This means delivering exactly what the employer is looking for, rather than irrelevant accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **[[customizing_resumes_for_specific_roles | Customization is Crucial]]**: Stop being "lazy" about customizing your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This is especially important in today's competitive job market, particularly for coveted remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Customizing your resume offers a significant competitive advantage over applicants who do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Be Concise**: Avoid "wordy" resumes with long blocks of text that can cause eyes to glaze over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers are likely to skip over such resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Be selective with words and focus on how it lays out on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Avoid Proprietary Language**: Do not use proprietary titles, project names, division names, or product types known only by your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Boil down concepts into clear, common language for the industry you are applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Remove Generic Fluff**: Eliminate generic, fluffy terminology like "team player" or "great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. These competencies are typically assessed during interviews, and the resume is unlikely to convey them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Focus instead on actionable terms and concepts relevant to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit, not to impress with elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Continuous Improvement

*   **Be Adaptable**: If your resume isn't getting results, don't be stubbornâ€”redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Continuing the same approach and expecting different results is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Assess Fit Realistically**: If you're facing repeated rejections at the application level, your resume is likely not working, especially if you believe you are a good fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Review the job posting closely to ensure your qualifications truly align, as employers may have many other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Plan, Do, Check, Adjust**: If your resume isn't getting results, make changes and try different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Ensure your resume clearly conveys your fit for the role to maximize your chances of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

This article explores various professions and their reported compensation, with a focus on roles that involve significant stress or high-stakes environments, based on self-reported data from Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. It's important to note that this data is self-reported and should be taken "with a bit of a grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Professions with Notable Stress Factors

### Jet Engine Builder
Individuals who build jet engines report making $43.13 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This role is considered "pretty high skilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, and building a jet engine incorrectly could lead to "catastrophic consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, indicating a high level of responsibility and precision. The annual income from this rate is approximately $90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Car Sales
Compensation for car sales professionals can vary widely, from $30,000 to $120,000 per year, depending on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. The wide swing in income suggests that a "pretty strong stomach" is needed to handle the financial variability of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Current market conditions with car shortages mean cars are "selling themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, which can be beneficial, but a lack of inventory makes earning income difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. This directly relates to [[salary_expectations_and_negotiations]] and [[competitive_salary_and_benefits_evaluation]].

### Travel Nurse
Travel nurses are currently earning "insane numbers," with one individual making $5,100 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This can translate to approximately $229,000 to $230,000 per year if working around 45 weeks annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. However, this is described as a "high stress high burnout job" due to constant travel and moving "from assignment to assignment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. The demand for travel nursing is not expected to decrease anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>, offering significant financial opportunity for those open to a "nomadic" lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. This highlights [[understanding_job_expectations_and_compensation]].

### Minor League Baseball Player
The pay for minor league baseball players "pretty much stinks," at $2,000 per month for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. There is "absolutely no guarantee" of moving into the major leagues, and the percentage of players who make it to the big leagues is "astronomically small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. This profession is not a reliable career path due to the low pay and extreme uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. This is a stark example of [[expectations_versus_compensation]].

### Options Investor/Trader
An options investor reported making $125,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. While the "sky's the limit" for traders who know what they're doing, it's also possible to "lose it very quickly" without proper knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. This implies high financial risk and potential stress for those in the field.

### 9-1-1 Operator
A 9-1-1 operator reported earning $28 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. This is acknowledged as a "high-stress job" that is "not for everybody," given the difficult situations and urgency involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.

### Social Worker
Social workers report an annual income of $46,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. It is advised not to pursue social work for the money, but rather as a "calling" or "passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. These "not-for-profit and social work" industries generally do not pay as much as sectors like software development or tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. This illustrates [[income_disparities_among_various_professions]].

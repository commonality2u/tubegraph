Getting fired means the employer decides to end your employment arrangement with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This scenario typically comes with more negatives than positives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Potential Benefits of Getting Fired

The main, and potentially only, reason to prefer being fired over quitting is the possibility of collecting unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

> [!INFO] Unemployment Eligibility
> Being fired does not automatically guarantee unemployment eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
> *   **Likely Denied**: If termination is due to "gross negligence" such as causing a fight or stealing from the company (i.e., for cause), unemployment benefits will likely be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
> *   **Generally Granted**: If termination is due to poor performance, such as not being good at the job, receiving write-ups, or being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), an employer will find it difficult to defend against an unemployment claim, and you will likely receive benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Getting Fired

There are many negatives associated with being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

*   **Stigma**: There is a significant stigma associated with being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Explaining a termination to a significant other can be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Interview Challenges**: You will need to explain poor performance or more difficult issues during job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. An employer will inevitably question things more deeply and scrutinize your resume if you admit to being terminated, viewing it as a potential risk to their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control**: Termination is not on your own terms; you are at the employer's mercy, who may or may not provide warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Some individuals might go through a PIP, which gives them time to start a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   However, cases of gross negligence or immediate termination can thrust you into the unemployment market unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Ineligibility for Rehire**: You are likely not eligible for rehire by the employer who terminated you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Difficulty with References**: It will likely be difficult to obtain positive references from the former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. While employers generally won't disclose termination during an employment verification, they may check references, so securing those is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Scenarios Involving Getting Fired

### Poor Performance Track Record
If you have a history of poor performance, notice Human Resources documenting your actions, are facing pressure, or are on a [[signs_of_potential_job_termination | Performance Improvement Plan]], it might be better to be terminated rather than quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. If the termination is strictly performance-related (e.g., you're not doing a good job, are in over your head, or the job is not a good fit), you will likely be able to collect unemployment and maintain some continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. In this situation, there is no real advantage to quitting, as you won't get a positive reference or be eligible for rehire anyway due to existing "negative goodwill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

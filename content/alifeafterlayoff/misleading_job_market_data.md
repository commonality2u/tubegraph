The current job market often presents [[current_job_market_challenges | conflicting data]], with official reports suggesting a robust market and record job openings, while simultaneously, major corporations announce widespread [[impact_of_layoffs_and_market_fluctuation_on_job_availability | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This discrepancy can be confusing for job seekers, as positions seemingly never get filled despite high reported job opening numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The overall number of job openings might be misleading, as many posted positions could be contract, part-time, or seasonal roles that often lack benefits and aren't considered career-type jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This contributes to the frustration of job seekers who hear about a "great" job market but don't experience it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Ghost Job Postings

A significant contributor to this misleading data is the rise of "ghost postings" or fake job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A ghost posting is defined as a job advertisement that an employer has no real intention of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Pipelining Requisitions
One type of ghost posting is a "pipelining wreck" (requisition), where an employer posts a job to collect resumes for a future date without immediate hiring intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These are designed to give employers a head start when they eventually decide to recruit again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Employers have been known to suggest posting these "pipelining wrecks" even after recent mass layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This practice creates a poor [[strategies_for_job_seekers_in_a_challenging_market | candidate experience]], especially for laid-off individuals who invest time in crafting targeted resumes and applications for positions that aren't genuinely open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Employers and talent acquisition leaders sometimes lose sight of the job seeker's perspective, failing to consider the emotional toll of applying for a job that won't be filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Survey Insights on Ghost Jobs

A survey conducted by Clarify Capital between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, interviewed 1,045 managers involved in hiring about ghost jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
Key findings include:
*   **68% of managers** had job postings active for more than 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **1 in 10 hiring managers** had a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **One in five managers** did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **50% of managers** keep job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs

The most common reasons employers are not actively trying to fill a position:
*   **Always open to new people (50%)**: Companies want to "window shop" for candidates, just in case someone exceptionally good applies, without a genuine intention to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This is seen as lazy and irresponsible recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated**: This reason is considered sinister, as it involves deceiving overworked employees into believing help is coming when it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing**: This is considered deceitful to both job candidates and investors and could potentially have legal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **The job was filled**: If a job requisition is filled, it should be immediately pulled down from job boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This points to lazy recruiters or HR personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates**: Companies maintain a pool of applicants for future turnover, mirroring how job seekers should always be ready for new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies**: Similar to "always open to new people," this implies a passive approach where employers are only willing to hire if an exceptional candidate requires no effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Forgot to delete the job**: A clear sign of a lazy recruiter or HR person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **No particular reason**: Some employers simply don't care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## How to Identify and Avoid Ghost Job Postings

Job seekers can employ [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_navigate_tough_job_markets | strategies to navigate]] the presence of ghost postings:

1.  **Check the posting date**: If a job has been up for over six months, or if it's repeatedly posted over a long period, it's likely a ghost wreck or indicates a low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Conduct reverse reference checks**: Investigate if the company recently had major [[impact_of_layoffs_and_market_fluctuation_on_job_availability | layoffs]] in the same positions they are now advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If so, they might be building a pipeline for future hiring, indicating a lack of loyalty to those roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
3.  **Analyze the job description**: Detailed job descriptions with specific responsibilities and reporting structures indicate a more serious and active recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Generic descriptions that are salesy about the company but lack specific role details are [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] and often indicative of pipelining wrecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
4.  **Consider the recency of the post**: Jobs posted within the last week are more likely to be legitimate and actively recruited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

By being aware of these indicators, job seekers can avoid falling victim to ghost postings and focus their efforts on high-quality roles with legitimate employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

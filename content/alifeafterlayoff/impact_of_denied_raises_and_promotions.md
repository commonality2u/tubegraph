Being denied raises or promotions can be significant indicators that a company intends to "quietly fire" an employee. This practice, often termed "constructive dismissal" in HR, involves making an employee's work situation so difficult that they feel compelled to quit voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Companies may engage in this to avoid potential issues if they were to terminate the employee, or to circumvent paying out benefits like unemployment insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Signs of Quiet Firing

### Denied Raises
One major sign of a company looking to push an employee out is a consistent lack of raises over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is particularly notable if other colleagues in the same department or company have received pay increases while you have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. If a company cuts an employee off from future raises, it's a strong signal to update one's resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Passed Over for Promotion
Another red flag is being repeatedly passed over for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Even if an employee has clearly expressed interest in a promotion and has actively positioned themselves as the best fit, consistently being overlooked for others—potentially less deserving candidates—is a significant warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

When companies decide to promote one individual over another, there are often internal discussions about the potential repercussions, including how to handle the fallout if an employee who felt they were next in line is skipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. If you are continually blocked from advancement, it's generally not an opportunity worth maintaining, as [[loss_of_career_momentum_and_compensation_issues | a steady job can be detrimental to one's career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Employee Actions
If an employee recognizes these signs, particularly the denial of raises and promotions, it's advisable to act like a "free agent" and prioritize one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This includes updating your resume, networking, and actively seeking new job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Options for Employees
If you suspect you are being constructively dismissed, you have several options:
*   **Force the company's hand** by continuing status quo and letting them terminate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Voluntarily quit** and seek a more supportive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Remaining in a toxic work environment can be detrimental to personal and mental health, as well as career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Seek legal counsel** if you believe you are being discriminated against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Regardless of your chosen path, it is always best practice to keep your resume updated and ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

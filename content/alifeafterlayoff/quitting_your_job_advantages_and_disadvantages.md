Deciding how to leave a job is a significant career decision, with different implications depending on whether you quit, are fired, or are laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This article breaks down the pros and cons of [[reasons_to_quit_your_job | quitting your job]] from both the employee's and a prospective employer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Advantages of Quitting Your Job

Quitting your job offers several benefits, primarily centered around control and career advancement:

*   **Control and Autonomy**
    *   You leave on your own terms, acting as a "free agent" in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This allows you to proactively shape your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   You choose the precise moment to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   You likely have a new job lined up, ensuring you're fully [[preparing_to_quit_a_job_safely | prepared to make the move]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Career and Financial Growth**
    *   Making proactive and sometimes drastic changes can help you get ahead in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   If you've been with a company for a long time, the market may have surpassed your current compensation. Quitting to test the open market often leads to bigger pay increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Job Search Benefits**
    *   It's generally easier to get another job when you're currently employed, as there's less pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. You're not forced into taking the first offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Being employed reduces stress during interviews, allowing you to relax, sell yourself more easily, and have more negotiating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   You have the initiative to control the narrative regarding [[reasons_for_leaving_a_job_and_how_to_discuss_them | why you left]] your previous position during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Future Options**
    *   If you quit correctly, you may be eligible for rehire, offering a valuable safety net should things go south with a new employer or during an economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Quitting Your Job

Despite the advantages, there are also potential downsides to [[reasons_not_to_quit_your_job | quitting your job]]:

*   **Loss of Rehire Eligibility**
    *   If you "burn bridges" by not observing [[proper_etiquette_for_quitting_a_job | proper etiquette for quitting]], you may not be eligible for rehire at your old company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of the New Role**
    *   The "grass isn't always greener"; your new employer might be similar to your old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   Your previous job might be filled, eliminating the option of returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Financial Implications**
    *   You will not receive any severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   You are unlikely to collect unemployment benefits, unless you can prove you left due to a toxic work environment and it was your only option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. If you quit simply because you were tired or wanted a change, unemployment is very slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Quitting in Specific Scenarios

### Quitting vs. Getting Fired

If you have a track record of poor performance and are facing documentation or a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), it might actually be better to be terminated for performance-related issues than to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. If termination is due to poor performance (e.g., not being good at your job, being in over your head, bad fit), you are generally eligible for unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. In this case, quitting offers no real advantage because you likely won't receive a positive reference, nor will you be eligible for rehire anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Quitting vs. Getting Laid Off

If you anticipate a softening market or industry downturn where layoffs are likely but not yet announced, it may be beneficial to wait before quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Quitting just weeks before a major layoff at your company would mean missing out on a potentially hefty severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. [[being_laid_off_benefits_and_drawbacks | Being laid off]] generally means eligibility for unemployment and often a severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Employer's View in Interviews

From an employer's perspective, quitting your job is generally seen as the most preferable scenario compared to being fired or laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, employers still want to understand your [[reasons_for_leaving_a_job_and_how_to_discuss_them | reasons for quitting]] and ensure you didn't just leave due to an upsetting "tough situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It's important to demonstrate how you've overcome adversity and that you have valid, professional reasons for your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

An incident involving a woman named Alisyn, who posted a toxic interaction with her boss on TikTok, went viral, prompting a deeper look into [[understanding_and_identifying_toxic_workplaces | toxic workplace dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The situation raises questions about whether the problem lies with a [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic boss]], a toxic company, a toxic Human Resources department, or a toxic employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Identifying Toxic Dynamics

It is inevitable that most employees will experience a confrontational or [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic situation]] with a boss at some point in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Many bosses are placed in leadership roles without adequate skill or competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Red Flags with New Management
When a new boss is brought in, especially from outside the organization, they often come with their own preconceived ideas of what "good" looks like based on their past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. If a new manager was not directly involved in an employee's hiring, it can be a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. In such cases, it is advisable to update one's resume, build networks, and prepare for a potential job search due to the high variability and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is especially true if a new senior leader reorganizes everything and is not fully invested in existing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Employee Behavior
An employee's perspective can be biased, and they may assign judgment to a boss's performance without full knowledge of their responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, Alisyn assumed her new manager was "doing absolutely nothing" while making a six-figure salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, an employee typically does not know what their manager is doing behind the scenes, such as interacting with directors or managing other projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

When an employee attempts to delegate tasks upward to their manager or assigns them additional work, it can be perceived negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Directly confronting a manager in an agitated manner, especially when the manager is already frustrated, can lead to further deterioration of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Maintaining a level of professionalism and respect is crucial in a reporting relationship, even if an employee dislikes their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

### The Role of Human Resources
Human Resources (HR) is not always an employee's friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. When an employee complains to HR, they are essentially putting a target on their back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. HR's primary function is not to police the organization or side with an employee against a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Instead, they will:
*   Take notes on the complaint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Review the complaining employee's file, including their background, tenure, performance appraisals, and documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Speak with senior leadership and the manager in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   If there is no concrete evidence of discrimination, and the complaint is primarily emotional, HR may deem the employee to be the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### EEOC Involvement
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is generally employee-focused and operates on the principle that the employer is guilty until proven innocent in the court of the EEOC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. They require employers to prove their innocence by demonstrating a long history of issues with the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. If the EEOC declines to investigate a discrimination case further, it strongly suggests the employee had no valid legal case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### De-escalation and Professionalism
When a conversation with a manager devolves and becomes agitated, the employee should try to de-escalate the situation and end the call as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Continuing to argue or be combative will only be perceived negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Consequences of Publicizing Workplace Issues
Recording conversations with a manager without their knowledge and posting them on social media (e.g., TikTok, LinkedIn) can lead to serious legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Disclosing company names and tagging CEOs on public platforms can "scarlet letter" an employee, making them appear as a problem to not only the current company but also the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

Recruiters and hiring teams frequently check social media profiles of potential candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. Posting negative content about a former employer can lead to being labeled a "toxic candidate" or "toxic employee," making it difficult to find future employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

### Prioritizing One's Career
While it is common to encounter a bad employer or boss, it is generally better to walk away and move on rather than allowing one bad situation to destroy an entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Publicizing every detail of a dispute on social media is detrimental to one's professional future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Instead of fighting and causing more problems, focus on finding a new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

> [!TIP] "At some point in every single one of our careers, we're going to find ourselves in a situation where we're dealing with a [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic boss]], a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic workplace]], and a job that isn't a good fit for us. It is not worth you blowing up your entire career and scarlet lettering yourself over one bad employer. It is much better to just walk away and leave them in the dust." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>

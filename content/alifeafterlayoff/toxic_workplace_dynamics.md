A recent viral TikTok video showcased a [[Workplace relationships and dynamics | toxic interaction]] between an employee, Alicean, and her boss, prompting a discussion on various [[Negative workplace culture | workplace issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This situation raises questions about whether the toxicity stems from a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic boss]], a [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic company]], a [[Impact of toxic work environments | toxic human resources department]], or even a [[the_effects_of_toxic_work_environments | toxic employee]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Employee's Perspective on a Toxic Manager

Alicean, who has been documenting her unemployment journey, posted a video of an interaction with her former manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Her account details a small team of five where only she and one other person were not in management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. After a year, her previous manager was replaced by a new manager who Alicean felt was "determined to hate me from day one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. She claims that nobody evaluated how the new manager was treating her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Key issues highlighted by Alicean include:
*   **Unfair workload and compensation** Alicean absorbed half of her first manager's responsibilities, which were not shifted back to the new manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. She reported making less money than when she started, while perceiving her manager doing "absolutely nothing" for a six-figure salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Poor communication and lack of support** The new manager allegedly avoided talking to Alicean and told her to find answers elsewhere when asked for help, which Alicean interpreted as an attempt to "set me up for failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The manager also hid her Outlook calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **PTO (Paid Time Off) issues** After four months without taking time off and accumulating over 100 hours of PTO, Alicean took a week off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Despite attempting to discuss coverage and providing detailed notes, the team email inbox was ignored during her absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Upon her return, the manager had no intention of discussing what happened, and many tasks were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Retaliation and Layoff** Alicean reported her manager to HR multiple times, but HR could not prove mistreatment because meetings weren't recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Consequently, things worsened, with Alicean being required to physically count every email sent and received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. She was laid off in April, with the company citing financial reasons, though Alicean believed it was retaliation due to a new employee being hired for an open position on their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Role of Human Resources (HR) and EEOC

> [!CAUTION] HR is Not Your Friend
> Human Resources departments are not intended to "police" an organization or be an employee's confidante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. When an employee reports issues to HR, it can put a "target on your back," as HR's primary role is to protect the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

Upon receiving a complaint, HR typically:
1.  Reviews the employee's file, including background, tenure, performance appraisals, and documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
2.  Consults with the senior leader of the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
3.  Discusses the complaint with the manager in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

If complaints are based on emotional feelings rather than concrete evidence, HR may perceive the complaining employee as the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Alicean complained formally twice to HR, leading her to be on their "radar" as a potential problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Alicean also contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The EEOC declined to investigate further, which is "very telling" because the EEOC is typically very employee-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. In the EEOC's "court," the employer is "guilty until proven innocent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. If there were a valid case of discrimination, especially involving a disability (Alicean claims to have neurodivergence), the EEOC would likely investigate and even file suit on the employee's behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The refusal to investigate suggests "she had absolutely no case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## The Confrontational Meeting

The interaction between Alicean and her manager, which Alicean recorded without the manager's knowledge, quickly devolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Recording someone without their permission can lead to "pretty serious legal hot water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

During the meeting, Alicean's manager showed clear signs of agitation and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. Alicean repeatedly questioned the manager about unfinished tasks during her PTO, trying to "delegate upward" and assign her boss tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. The manager expressed frustration that Alicean was not acknowledging the team's work and was complaining to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

The meeting was likely scheduled because Alicean had gone around her manager to complain to a senior director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

## Consequences of Public Escalation

After being laid off, Alicean continued to post videos on TikTok and LinkedIn, tagging the CEOs of her former company and its parent company, McKesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. She claims her layoff was illegal retaliation for reporting harassment, bullying, and discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. She received a cease and desist order due to her public videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

Alicean's public actions, including naming the company and its leadership, are seen as "scarlet lettering herself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. This public display can make it "almost impossible to even find a serving job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Recruiters and hiring teams often check social media, and such content will likely label her as a "toxic candidate" or "toxic employee," making future employment difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

> [!TIP] Navigating Toxic Work Environments
> Inevitably, most people will encounter a [[navigating_toxic_work_environments | confrontational or toxic situation with a boss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. If a new boss was not directly involved in hiring you, it can be a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. If faced with a [[impact_of_a_toxic_work_environment_on_career_and_health | toxic workplace]], it is often better to update your resume, build your network, and discreetly seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It is crucial to maintain a level of professionalism in interactions with management, even when disagreements arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. Escalating conflict publicly or through social media can severely damage one's career prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>, as it is "not worth blowing up your entire career over one bad employer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

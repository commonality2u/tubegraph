A recent viral TikTok video showcased a woman's [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic interaction]] with her boss, which upon deeper investigation, revealed multiple layers of complex workplace dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This situation prompts a discussion to determine whether the core issue stemmed from a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic boss]], a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic company]], a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic human resources department]], or even a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic employee]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Case Study: Alison's Experience

The employee in question, Alison, had been creating content about her unemployment, and her interaction with a new boss caught significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Alison's Perspective
Alison was part of a small team of five, with only two members not in management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. After a year with her initial "wonderful manager," a new manager was introduced who, according to Alison, was "determined to hate" her from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. She felt that nobody evaluated how the new manager was treating her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

During the transition, Alison absorbed half of her previous manager's responsibilities, which were not shifted to the new manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. She brought this up multiple times as she was making less money than when she started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Alison believed her new manager did "absolutely nothing" while earning a six-figure salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The new manager allegedly avoided talking to Alison, told her to find answers elsewhere when asked for help, and even hid her Outlook calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Alison felt the manager's goal was to set her up for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

After four months without taking time off and accumulating over 100 hours of PTO, Alison took a week off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. A meeting to discuss coverage was scheduled but did not happen as the manager also left without telling Alison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Alison worked six hours of overtime to prepare detailed notes for her absence, but the team email inbox was ignored during her PTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Upon her return, many tasks had been ignored, leading Alison to email the director about the lack of coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This prompted a last-minute meeting with her manager, where Alison felt her manager was "pissed" and tried to blame an IT transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

At her "breaking point," Alison reported her manager to HR multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. However, HR "could never prove" bad treatment because meetings weren't recorded, leading to things worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Alison was then made to physically count every email she sent and received, sometimes processing over 800 emails a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. She was laid off in April, supposedly for financial reasons, but a new person was hired for an open position on their team, which Alison saw as contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. She sent video evidence to HR leadership, but nothing happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### The Speaker's Analysis

The speaker observes that while the manager likely had communication problems and did not effectively manage team transitions or emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, Alison also displayed behaviors that contributed to the situation.

#### The Role of Human Resources
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
> [!caution] HR is not your friend.
> When an employee reports a manager to HR, it often puts a target on their back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. HR's primary role is to protect the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. They will investigate by reviewing the employee's file (performance appraisals, documented issues), speaking with senior leaders, and then the manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. If complaints are emotional rather than concrete, the employee can be seen as a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. In Alison's case, complaining formally twice likely put her on HR's radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

#### EEOC Involvement
Alison also contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), but they declined to investigate her case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This is highly telling, as the EEOC is typically very employee-focused, often operating on the principle that the employer is guilty until proven innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. If the EEOC declines to investigate, it typically means there was no valid case of discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Even with Alison's self-disclosed neurodivergence/disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, if the EEOC found any evidence of discrimination, they would have investigated further or taken the case on her behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

#### The Recorded Conversation
Alison recorded her manager without consent and posted it to TikTok, which could lead to serious legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

During their recorded conversation:
*   **Communication Breakdown:** The manager acknowledges a "miscommunication" regarding her absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The speaker agrees there's a consistent communication issue from the manager's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Delegating Upward:** Alison expresses frustration that her detailed notes and expectations for work coverage were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. The speaker views Alison's attempts to dictate how her work should be handled during her absence as "delegating upward," which can irritate a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Escalation and Professionalism:** As the conversation progresses, the manager becomes agitated, telling Alison to "Listen to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The speaker advises Alison should have de-escalated and ended the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. Alison's repeated questioning and emotional breakdown during the call are seen as combative and lacking professional respect for her manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Unauthorized Overtime:** Alison mentioned working 5.5 hours of overtime to prepare notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. The speaker points out this was likely unauthorized and perceived by the boss as unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Meeting Context:** The manager states the meeting was called to calmly review issues, implying Alison went around her boss to a senior director, forcing the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Consequences of Continued Actions
Alison's continued public posts on TikTok and LinkedIn, tagging company CEOs (like McKesson, whose CEO untagged himself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>, are seen as "scarlet lettering" herself within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. She received a cease and desist letter, to which she responded with further accusations of nepotism, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

The speaker highlights that recruiters and hiring teams check social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. Such public displays of conflict can label a candidate as "toxic," making it nearly impossible to find new employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. Alison's TikTok feed focusing on this one employer is seen as detrimental to her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

The recommended [[strategies_to_deal_with_toxic_workplaces | strategy]] is to walk away, leave it in the past, and seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. This includes avoiding recording conversations or posting grievances on social media, especially professional platforms like LinkedIn, as it can lead to being automatically labeled as a problem by future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.

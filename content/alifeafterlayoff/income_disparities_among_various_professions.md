This article explores various self-reported salaries, providing insights into income disparities across different professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The data was gathered from a Reddit thread where individuals shared their actual earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

Efforts were made to exclude entries clearly not from North America to allow for comparable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. However, some salaries are anecdotally confirmed to be accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## High-Income Professions

Several professions reported significantly high annual incomes, often reflecting specialized skills, high demand, or significant responsibility.

*   **Private Jet Captain:** An individual reported earning around $360,000 per year, with variations due to overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The base salary was clarified to be in the low $200,000s, with bonuses, holidays, and extra work days contributing to the higher total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The speaker noted this figure is likely accurate, given anecdotal evidence of pilots moving from mainline airlines to the private sector for increased income and better hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Corporate flying gigs, especially for executive teams, are considered desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Plant Electrician:** Earning $50 per hour, this role brings in between $130,000 to $150,000 annually with overtime and bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The individual was also moving into an operations role at the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. [[salaries_in_skilled_trades_versus_traditional_paths|Skilled trades]] in this high-risk environment can lead to substantial incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Officer on a Container Ship:** This individual works about six months out of the year, making approximately $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The job primarily involves "looking out the window at some waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, offering significant time off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **Electrical Substation Design Engineer:** With five to seven years of experience, this engineer reports an annual income of $126,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. The speaker suggested this could be even higher, potentially up to $150,000, for electrical engineers in the power industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Underwater Welder:** This extremely dangerous profession, often associated with offshore oil platforms, reports earnings between $216,000 and $300,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. The speaker emphasized the inherent risks and time away from home as justifications for the high pay, equating it to "physician level income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
*   **Freelance Video Editor:** Daily rates can range from $500 to $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. A bad year might yield $40,000-$50,000, while a solid year could bring in $95,000-$110,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. This highlights the variability of "gig work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Walmart Yard Driver:** This individual, responsible for moving trucks in a distribution warehouse, claims to make $10,000 a month, totaling $120,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. This figure, even with overtime, contrasts sharply with the pay of other critical professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   **Travel Nurse:** Working for an agency, a travel nurse reported an hourly rate of $81.50, with overtime reaching a "staggering" $130 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. The speaker noted the ability of travel nurses to pick and choose work due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   **Street Magician:** Income for street magicians varies greatly by location and season, ranging from $300 to $3,000 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. In a good location and season, an average of $100,000 annually is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Technical Person:** With a PhD and less than one year of experience, this IT professional reported an income of $230,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.

The speaker, with experience in technical recruiting at a "FANG" company, confirmed this is not unrealistic, with a base salary likely between $200,000-$225,000 and the rest in restricted stock units and similar benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.
*   **Carpenter (Union):** A union carpenter reported an hourly rate of $67, including benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. Working 40 hours a week, this translates to $140,000 annually before overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. This is another example of a high-earning [[salaries_in_skilled_trades_versus_traditional_paths|skilled trade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

This includes full benefits and retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.

*   **Research (Brain Cells, HIV, Cocaine, Fentanyl):** A researcher with a master's degree reported an annual income of $29,500, equivalent to $14 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The speaker found this "poverty level" wage shocking given the required education and research field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Medical Coder:** Earning $31 per hour, which equates to about $65,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. The speaker noted that while some medical coders can earn more with significant overtime, the base rate might be closer to the mid-$20s per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This job typically doesn't require a bachelor's degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Air Ambulance Pilot:** This helicopter pilot, presumably involved in life-flighting, reported an income of $80,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

*   **Air Traffic Controller:** Claiming to make around $100,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. The speaker highlighted this as one of the most [[high_stress_professions_and_their_compensation|stressful jobs]], responsible for thousands of lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. The speaker felt this was "underpaid for the amount of responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
*   **Strip Club DJ:** Grossing around $65,000 per year for working three nights a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This allows for time to pursue other "side hustles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Restaurant Manager (Well-Known Chain):** A manager at a well-known chain restaurant reported a $75,000 base salary with an additional $20,000-$25,000 annual bonus, totaling around $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. The speaker considered this "probably not terrible" for the hospitality industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
*   **Professional Theater Actress:** Currently making $568 per week before taxes, which translates to approximately $29,500 annually if working year-round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

*   **EMT (Emergency Medical Technician):** Reporting a wage of $15 per hour, considered the "high end starting wage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

The speaker expressed dismay at these wages for "first-line defense" professionals who save lives and deal with horrific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.
*   **Aircraft Cleaner:** Earning $17 an hour, with the significant perk of free flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

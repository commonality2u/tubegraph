A significant sign that a candidate might be a "red flag" often appears early in the [[interview_preparation_tips | interview process]] if they show up late or unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. First impressions are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Consequences of Lateness and Unpreparedness

Showing up to an interview 15 minutes late, perhaps due to traffic or parking issues, leads the interviewer to assume that you don't manage your time effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This immediately creates a poor first impression, forcing you to play catch-up for the remainder of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Similarly, not being prepared is a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Instances include candidates being clearly caught off guard when called at the pre-arranged time, even to the extent of still being asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Such lack of preparedness results in a poor first impression and can lead to a poor performance in the interview, often preventing progression to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Being on time and prepared are factors entirely within your control, leaving no excuse for neglecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The objective as a job seeker should be to make the hiring process as straightforward as possible for the employer, avoiding any self-created roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This contributes to a positive [[professional_demeanor_during_an_interview | professional demeanor]] and demonstrates strong [[role_of_interview_skills_in_getting_hired | interview skills]].

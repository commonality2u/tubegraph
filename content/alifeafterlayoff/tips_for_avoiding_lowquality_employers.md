When navigating the job market, it's crucial to identify and avoid [[evaluating_employer_quality_and_salary_offers | low-quality employers]] or potential scams. An illustrative example of what to watch out for is a job application form that included numerous illegal and highly inappropriate questions, shared by a talent acquisition manager on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the legitimacy of the company in question was doubted, it serves as an extreme example of [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] that job seekers should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | Red Flags]] in the Hiring Process

Several signs can indicate a [[evaluating_employer_quality_and_salary_offers | low-quality employer]] or a potential scam during the application process:

*   **HR Handling Talent Acquisition**: For a large corporation, if talent acquisition is handled directly by the Human Resources department instead of a dedicated talent acquisition department, it can be a [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. While common in localized factory settings, it's less typical for larger entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**: If a company manually sends forms to fill out instead of using an ATS or an online application portal, it suggests a lack of professional infrastructure and can be a [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Suspicious Financial Requests**: Be highly aware if an employer asks you to cash any checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This is a common tactic in scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

Always vet the opportunity by confirming that real people work there and cross-referencing information with the company's official corporate website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## [[questions_that_indicate_low_quality_employers | Illegal and Inappropriate Application Questions]]

Many questions on job applications, particularly in the United States, are illegal under anti-discrimination laws. If an employer asks these questions, especially for a US-based role, it's a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Illegal Questions:

*   **Marital/Civil Status**: Questions about whether you are single, married, divorced, separated, or have a significant other, including requests for additional comments, are completely illegal and have no bearing on job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Children/Family Status**: Asking if you have kids, how many minors, or if you have childcare for working hours is highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate based on family status, perceived daycare issues, or family planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Passport/Nationality/Country of Birth**: Inquiring about what passports you hold, your nationality, country of birth, or country of origin is illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. This information has no bearing on your ability to do the job, assuming you are legally allowed to work in the country of application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Age**: Directly asking for your age is illegal due to ageism concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   **Religion**: Questions about your religion or any past changes in religious affiliation are prohibited as religion is a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions**: Inquiries about medical conditions, medications, or upcoming surgeries are highly invasive and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

### Questions that *May* Be Illegal:

*   **Height and Weight**: While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight requirements disproportionately limit opportunities for some protected groups. Unless directly related to a job requirement (e.g., for a specific physical task), such inquiries should be avoided as they may be viewed as illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] How Employers *Should* Ask
>
> Instead of asking about personal protected characteristics, employers should phrase questions around job requirements. For example:
> *   Instead of "Do you have childcare?" they should ask, "This position requires you to work [set schedule/hours]. Are you able to meet that requirement?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>
> *   Instead of "What is your nationality?" they should ask, "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>

## Other Inappropriate Questions:

*   **Seriousness about the Role**: Asking, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how serious are you about [this] position?" is strange and unnecessary, as it's assumed an applicant is serious if they've applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Encountering a high number of [[questions_that_indicate_low_quality_employers | illegal questions]] on a job application or during an interview indicates a potentially [[evaluating_employer_quality_and_salary_offers | low-quality employer]], an unprofessional company, or even a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Keeping your radar up for these [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] is essential to focusing on the best quality employers and avoiding potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

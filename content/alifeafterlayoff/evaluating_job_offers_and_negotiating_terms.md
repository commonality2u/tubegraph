This article explores the complexities of evaluating job offers, particularly focusing on the common scenario of a counter offer from a current employer. It provides insights into why accepting a counter offer might not be in an individual's best interest, drawing from real-life examples and expert advice from a corporate recruiter and career coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Perils of Counter Offers

As a career coach, the strong recommendation is to think twice about accepting a counter offer from a current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Too many circumstances have shown that accepting a counter offer often doesn't work out well in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Case Study: A Reddit Scenario

A Reddit post illustrates a common situation: an individual accepts a new job offer and tenders their notice, only for their current company to suddenly present "big plans" and ask what it would take to keep them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

In this scenario:
*   The individual was offered a 30% pay bump by a non-competing company for similar work, but expanding upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This indicates the person might have been underpaid or stayed in their role too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   The new role offers expansion of experience, leading to a better resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This is preferable to a lateral move with the same experience and title, which can weaken a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   The individual's gut feeling advised that the new offer was the best course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, and trusting your gut is often a good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Upon resigning, the current boss asked how to retain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Suddenly, the company's leadership presented plans, including hiring new people to work under the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:03:00]</a>. This "proverbial carrot" is a common trap, keeping people in jobs too long with promises of future advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The individual recognized that "talk is cheap" and plans with this company often materialize slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. For any counter offer to be considered, it would need to be in writing and accompanied by a solid pay bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Handling Counter Offers from Current Employers

When faced with a counter offer, it's important to remember that you are in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Be Vague:** Do not disclose details about the new opportunity, including salary, company, or job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Companies have been known to "torpedo" new opportunities behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Hear Them Out:** Listen to what your current employer has to offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, but maintain your intention to honor your commitment to the accepted new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Focus on Opportunity, Not Issues:** Frame your departure not as leaving due to an issue, but as being pulled by a new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Avoid sharing internal grievances like feeling unchallenged or not performing your best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Documentation is Key:** If, exceptionally, you consider a counter offer, demand a formal offer letter from HR detailing a new job title, level, responsibilities, and pay range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Without a new job title and level, you might just become a more expensive version of your current self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Red Flags of Counter Offers

Accepting a counter offer can carry significant risks:
*   **Target on Your Back:** You may be viewed as a "flight risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> and become the most expensive person in your department, making you a potential target for future layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. There will be a higher level of expectation, and any mistakes could be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Prior Recognition:** A sudden generous pay bump after tendering resignation highlights that you weren't valued enough before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The company may have taken you for granted and is only trying to buy time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Promises:** Sudden "big plans" for your career advancement (e.g., leadership roles, C-suite levels) are often hollow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Reputable companies have succession planning programs, development plans, and mentorship in place for future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. If you weren't part of these programs already, the sudden offer is suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Career advancement often takes a long time, especially in smaller companies where people wait for others to retire or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Insincere Offers:** Executives making counter offers may be out of touch with ground-level realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Offers that feel like they're "making something up" on the spot (e.g., suggesting a new team without a clear job description) are major red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Company-Centric View:** If the counter offer is framed as "we can use you" rather than "we want to help you grow your career," it indicates the company is acting purely from its own needs, not yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

## Evaluating New Job Offers

When [[evaluating_job_offers_and_company_culture | evaluating job offers]], especially a new one, consider these points:
*   **Market Rate:** Regularly check the open market and take interviews to understand your market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Career Growth:** Look for opportunities that offer expanded experience and will strengthen your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut:** Your intuition is a powerful tool when making significant career decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Past Performance Indicator:** Just as behavior-based interviewing suggests past performance indicates future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, the same applies to companies. Consider how your current company has treated you and others in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. A new company is more of a gamble in this regard, but you can [[evaluating_job_offers_and_company_culture | assess company culture]] during the interview process.
*   [[assessing_overall_job_offer_value_including_benefits_and_perks | Assessing overall job offer value including benefits and perks]] is crucial, not just salary.

### Negotiating Terms for New Offers

When you have a new offer, you should [[negotiation_strategies_with_recruiters_and_employers | negotiate the best possible terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This includes [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | salary negotiations and expectations]]. The goal is to secure terms that truly benefit your career trajectory.

## The Decision to Move On

Ultimately, the individual in the Reddit scenario decided not to accept the counter offer, acknowledging that nothing truly changes with the existing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. They decided to accept the new offer and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, demonstrating an effective approach to [[navigating_job_offers_and_employment_strategies | navigating job offers and employment strategies]].

While there might be rare exceptions where a counter offer is beneficial, it's important to trust your gut and fully understand the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 
The initial impression a resume makes on recruiters and hiring teams is crucially important in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. A clean, concise, and well-crafted resume is essential to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. As a corporate recruiter, certain elements are consistently seen as mistakes that can hinder a candidate's chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Irrelevant Work History

Employers generally focus on a candidate's last 10 years of work experience, and often more recently, the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

*   **Age of Experience**
    *   Work history older than 10 years is typically no longer relevant, as skills and the market change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:47">[07:48:47]</a>. Unless a senior executive position specifically requires 20 years of experience, including an elaborate long work history is unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   **Industry-Specific Jargon and Acronyms**
    *   Avoid using industry-specific jargon, job titles, or acronyms that are not universally understood outside of a particular company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers should not have to work harder to understand what a candidate does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Omitting this specific language improves discoverability and clarity, increasing the chance of being hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Unnecessary Details

Including too much detail or irrelevant personal information can negatively impact a resume by distracting recruiters or leading to unintended discrimination. These elements fall under [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid]].

### Visual Distractions
*   **Bright Graphics, Colors, Graphs, Charts, and Clip Art**
    *   Avoid bright graphics or excessive colors, sticking to simple options like blues, blacks, or possibly magenta for elements like job titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. The goal is to keep the resume clean and concise, avoiding distractions from assessing a candidate's background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
    *   Graphs, charts, and clip art should generally be avoided as a resume is a professional document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. While some might consider them "cute" or personality-revealing, they can lead to judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The only exception is for creative fields like art director or graphic designer, where such elements demonstrate creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Infographics for Skill Proficiency**
    *   Using infographics to demonstrate skill proficiency (e.g., a bar chart showing "3 out of 10" for a skill) can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This explicitly highlights a weakness and can lead to self-elimination from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. It's better to let skills be assessed during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. While vagueness is preferred, lying about skills is not advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Columns**
    *   Multiple columns on a resume can cause issues with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which often parse left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. An ATS might only read the first column, making other listed skills invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This can prevent a candidate from being discovered in later searches using keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Removing columns is a simple fix to ensure discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Personal Identifiers and Unprofessional Elements
[[avoiding_personal_identifiers_and_unprofessional_elements_in_resumes]]
*   **Photographs**
    *   In the US or North America, including a photograph on a resume is not customary and can lead recruiters to assume a candidate is not US-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. While some countries may have different customs, it's generally best to avoid photographs in these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Protected Class Information**
    *   Avoid including personal identifiers such as gender, race, creed, color, marital status, or details about having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This information is not work-related and could be used by an unscrupulous employer for discriminatory purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Omitting details that fall under protected classes removes "low-hanging fruit" for discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Unprofessional Email Addresses**
    *   Email addresses should be professional and neutral (e.g., using a full name or a moniker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Unprofessional or "colorful" email addresses can lead hiring managers to judge or make assumptions about a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Full Residential Addresses**
    *   Only the city and state are needed on a resume; a full street address is obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Full addresses can lead to discrimination based on commute distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. For remote work, city and state are still important for time zones and company taxation/business setup requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

### Unnecessary Educational Details
*   **Excessive Degree Information**
    *   Avoid providing too much detail about degrees or specific college courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Simply listing the university and degree type is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Minor Degrees and GPAs**
    *   Minor degrees are not heavily weighted by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. While a nice keyword, they shouldn't consume much resume space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
    *   For candidates more than three years out of college, GPA is largely irrelevant and can be omitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. It's only worth including for entry-level candidates or those with less than three years of total work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Internships (for experienced candidates)**
    *   Internships can be dropped from a resume if a candidate has been in the workforce for longer than three years, as they are not typically counted as total years of experience and serve primarily as "vanity stats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

### References and Salary History
*   **References**
    *   Listing actual references or stating "references available upon request" is unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Recruiters will ask for references if needed, and most employers are moving away from routinely checking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Salary History/Expectations**
    *   Never include previous salary history or expected compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Disclosing this information can lead to a lowball offer, as an employer might offer less if they see a candidate's previous earnings were lower than their potential range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Salary discussions will occur during the first interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

### Generic Skills and Clichés
*   **Universal or Generic Skills**
    *   Avoid wasting valuable resume space on universal skills like Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, as proficiency in these is generally assumed for professional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Recruiters can ask about these if necessary during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. The same applies to generic "soft skills" like leadership and organizational skills; it's better to demonstrate these through bullet points describing accomplishments rather than listing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   **Cliche Jargon**
    *   Generic or cliché jargon, such as "team player" or "fast learner," should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. These phrases do not add value as no one would admit to not possessing these qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. Resume space is better used for more impactful, "meaty" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

If you are applying to jobs and not receiving callbacks despite being qualified, it is almost always a [[common_mistakes_in_resume_design_and_content | resume issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Optimizing your resume for recruitment teams is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

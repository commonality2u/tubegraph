The "tell me about yourself" or "introduce yourself" question is a common and often anxiety-inducing part of a job interview due to its ambiguous nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While it might seem like a simple icebreaker, it serves as a critical opportunity to make a strong [[first_impressions_in_job_interviews | first impression]] and set the tone for the entire interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Purpose of the "Tell Me About Yourself" Question

Hiring managers use this question to assess two primary areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
1.  **Competency:** Does the candidate possess the necessary skills to perform the job effectively? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
2.  **Motivational Fit:** Beyond skills, is the candidate a good motivational fit for the role? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

It is your chance to shine and tell the interviewer why you are a good fit for their position, making it one of the first questions you'll be asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This question offers a massive blank canvas, requiring a strategic approach rather than a blind answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## What Not to Say

When answering this question, avoid common pitfalls that can detract from your [[improving_job_interview_performance | performance]]:

*   **Do not rehash your resume:** The purpose is not to go line-by-line through your past jobs; the interviewer can read your resume for that detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Do not give a life summary:** Stick to the script and keep your answer related to the position you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Avoid personal stories like overcoming childhood adversity, European adventures, or hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Do not ramble:** Be concise, aiming for a response that is three to five minutes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Long-winded answers can be detrimental and should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Do not highlight irrelevant information:** Skip details about side hustles or other activities not directly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Focus on demonstrating why you are a great fit and genuinely interested in the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## How to Prepare and What to Include

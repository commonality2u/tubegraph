### Other Notable Professions

## Considerations for Career Choices

When considering [[career_plans_and_their_impact_on_interviews | career plans]], it's important to weigh earning potential against lifestyle, stress levels, and personal calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Some fields, like social work ($46,000/year), are explicitly noted for not being financially lucrative and are best pursued out of passion rather than for the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. In such cases, supplementing income with [[exploring_alternatives_to_traditional_9_to_5_employment_and_the_role_of_side_hustles | side hustles]] might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

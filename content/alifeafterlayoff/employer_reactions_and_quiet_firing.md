The employment market has seen a series of significant trends, including the [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | Great Resignation]], [[concept_of_quiet_quitting_in_the_workforce | quiet quitting]], and most recently, [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | quiet firing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These trends reflect the evolving power dynamics between employers and employees.

## Employer Reactions During the Pandemic Downturn

During the major economic downturn in 2020, which was a result of the pandemic, many employers had a "knee-jerk reaction" and conducted layoffs that they likely should not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This had a ripple effect on the workforce, as remaining employees were required to take on the additional work burden of those who were "forcibly exited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

During this period, a pervasive mantra in the employment market was, "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Employers were demanding more from their employees and cutting back on expenses to maximize their gains from the pandemic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This led to widespread burnout among workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Pendulum Swings: From Employee Power to Employer Regain

The period following the pandemic saw a significant shift in the power dynamic, often described as a "pendulum swing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Initially, the pendulum was "buried with the employer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### The Great Resignation and Quiet Quitting

The [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | Great Resignation]] began as a phenomenon where burnt-out employees reevaluated their lives and what they wanted from work, leading to mass resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This forced industry to react to a sudden lack of available talent, causing the pendulum to swing "forcibly the other way" towards an "extreme job seeker buyer market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

During this "Heyday of job seeking," some employees who didn't leave their jobs adopted [[concept_of_quiet_quitting_in_the_workforce | quiet quitting]] as an option. These individuals were burnt out but didn't want to leave, and the risk of scaling back their effort was low due to abundant job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### The Rise of Quiet Firing

As the pendulum began to swing back towards a more neutral position, employers started to regain power in the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:55]</a>. This shift led to the concept of [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | quiet firing]].

> "If we don't want to outright fire somebody but we want to encourage them to quit... there's a concept called a phenomena called quiet firing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

### Current Market Outlook (December 2022)

As of December 2022, the market remains shaky, with the pendulum seemingly swinging further towards the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. While the overall labor market shows some strength, specific industries, such as tech, have been heavily impacted by [[corporate_layoffs_and_employee_treatment | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

A study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers surveying 722 executives revealed significant trends:
*   Despite concerns about hiring and retaining talent, companies are streamlining their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Fifty percent of respondents are reducing their overall headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   Companies are "right-sizing," correcting for potential over-hiring during boom periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   There's evidence of widespread [[corporate_layoffs_and_employee_treatment | layoffs]] in major tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   Companies are instituting hiring freezes, further reducing headcount, and dropping sign-on bonuses and other perks that were common during the hiring boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   Furthermore, 44% of companies are rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

These indicators suggest a potentially "rocky 2023" for the employment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

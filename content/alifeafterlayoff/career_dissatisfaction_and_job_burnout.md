The concept of whether one "works to live" or "lives to work" is a frequent topic in career consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While individuals often appear satisfied with their careers externally, many harbor a sense of dread about work, especially on Monday mornings, and lack a burning passion for their professional lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Spending 20-30 years in a job without passion is considered a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Prevalence of Dissatisfaction

A majority of people seeking career consultations struggle with the direction of their career or are simply not satisfied with their current work, lacking motivation and drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It is suspected that many more people feel this way but do not outwardly express it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

When asked about their philosophy on work, a significant majority of the working population (estimated at 70%) work in order to afford a lifestyle, rather than viewing work as their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This is often highlighted by asking if they would continue their current job if they won the lottery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Many express simply hating their job or career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Causes of Career Dissatisfaction

Several factors contribute to widespread [[evaluating_career_dissatisfaction | career dissatisfaction]]:
*   **Workplace Culture**
    *   Issues with workplace culture that do not align with personal core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   Office politics, where getting on the wrong side of a boss or coworker can sidetrack a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Lack of Fulfillment**
    *   Being in career paths that do not provide deep, core satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, leading people to "power through" the work week looking forward to the weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Job Overloading and [[employee_burnout_and_boundaries | Burnout]]**
    *   Many people deal with job overloading, where 40-hour work weeks are a myth and 60-70 hour weeks are the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   Fear of taking vacation due to the amount of work that will pile up or accountability for dropped tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   This environment indicates a lack of resources and a need for more hires to spread the workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Such conditions can lead to being "worked to death" spiritually, physically, and emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Work-Driven Culture**
    *   The United States, for example, has a work-driven culture that makes it difficult for people to achieve work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   This cultural emphasis perpetuates career dissatisfaction, creating a perpetual cycle where being overworked leads to bitterness and a toxic workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## The Path to Dissatisfaction

Most people enter the workforce without a clear "end game" or goal in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Often, individuals take the first job available after college to gain experience, which then inadvertently places them on a specific career path or industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Promotions or opportunities can further solidify one's role in a vertical they never planned for, or had no idea they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Through a series of job changes, individuals become "branded" by the type of work they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. They progress in their careers and become accustomed to a certain lifestyle and salary range, which can lead to feeling trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The realization that they dislike their career often hits between the 10-20 year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, making a career shift very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

The core symptom of this situation is a lack of a "guiding light" or definitive career goal from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Without a true plan, careers are often pursued "willy-nilly," leading to the realization 20 years in that time has been "wasted" on unfulfilling work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Strategies for Addressing Dissatisfaction

### For Those Early in Their Careers
Individuals early in their careers or just out of college have a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. They have the ability to:
*   **Establish a Guiding Principle**: Put a plan in place with calculated steps towards what they truly want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Afford Risks**: The "power of time" allows them to take risks, try different things, and "cut bait" on roles they don't like without getting stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This prevents being promoted into a career vertical that isn't interesting or passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### For Those Later in Their Careers
Pivoting a career after age 40 is possible, but it requires a more calculated decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The objective is to think bigger and find a career that leads to living one's true best life, rather than just returning to an unsatisfying job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### General Advice
The most important step is to take action and make a definitive plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. It's crucial not to tolerate bad situations like toxic work cultures, poor pay, or unaligned industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Staying in such situations will only make career progression harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Without a plan, individuals risk living a perpetual lifestyle of dissatisfaction for 10, 20, or even 30 years until retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

The concept of "work to live versus live to work" is a frequent topic in career consultations, often arising when individuals are [[career_dissatisfaction_and_changes | unsatisfied in their career]] or the type of work they are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. A significant majority of people seeking career guidance struggle with the direction of their career or are simply dissatisfied with their current work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. They often lack the motivation and burning drive they feel they should have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Unseen Dissatisfaction

Many individuals who appear outwardly satisfied with their career progression may harbor a sense of dread about going to work on Monday mornings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Spending 20 to 30 years in a career without passion for that aspect of life is considered problematic, as it's difficult to sustain motivation for decades without an intrinsic drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## "Work to Live" Philosophy

A core question posed to clients is their philosophy on work: "Are you a work to live, or do you live to work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It is estimated that approximately 70% of the working population works primarily to afford a lifestyle, rather than viewing work as their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This perspective suggests that if they won the lottery, most would pursue entirely different endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. There is nothing inherently wrong with being someone who works to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Not everyone is suited for or desires to climb the corporate ladder or work excessively long hours to achieve satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## [[reasons_for_employee_dissatisfaction | Reasons for Employee Dissatisfaction]]

Many people experience [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | dissatisfaction in their careers]] due to various factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>:
*   **Cultural Issues**: Workplaces with cultures that do not align with an individual's core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Office Politics**: Navigating political landscapes, where inadvertently crossing the wrong person can sidetrack a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Unfulfilling Career Paths**: Jobs that do not provide deep, core satisfaction, leading individuals to merely "power through" the work week until the weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Job Overloading and Burnout**: Working 60-70 hour weeks is often the norm, making a 40-hour work week seem like a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This can lead to [[job_burnout | job burnout]], where employees are essentially "worked to death," indicating insufficient resources and a need for more staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Most people desire a work-life balance to spend time with family and pursue passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The work-driven culture in the United States often prevents this balance, contributing to perpetual [[career_dissatisfaction_and_changes | career dissatisfaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## How People End Up in Unfulfilling Careers

Often, individuals enter the workforce without a clear "end game" or goal in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. After college, many take the first job available for experience, which then places them into a particular career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Opportunities or promotions can further steer them onto career paths they never initially planned, especially if they had no idea what they wanted to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

As one progresses through job changes, they become "branded" by the type of work they do, making them sought after for similar roles based on their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This progression can lead to feeling "trapped" due to accustomed lifestyle and salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The realization of disliking their career often hits between the 10-to-20-year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Pivoting at this stage can be very difficult, risking a step backward in salary or discovering a new path is equally unfulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## The Importance of a Guiding Light

A common reason for career dissatisfaction is the lack of a "guiding light" or definitive career goal from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Without a true plan, individuals often wander aimlessly through their careers, only to realize decades later that they've spent years on something they're not passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Strategies for Career Satisfaction

### For Those Early in Their Career
Individuals early in their careers have a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. They have the ability to:
*   **Establish a Plan**: Put a guiding principle or plan in place early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Take Calculated Steps**: Make intentional decisions about career moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Afford Risks**: Leverage the "power of time" to take risks, try new things, and "cut bait" if a path isn't fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. It's crucial not to stay in an unfulfilling role too long, as it can lead to being stuck in an undesirable career vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### For Those Later in Their Career
For individuals on the "far side of their career," pivoting requires more calculated decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. It is possible to pivot in a career post-age 40, and it is often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. When facing an adverse employment situation like a layoff, it's an opportunity to think bigger and pursue a truly best life, even if it means not returning to a previously unfulfilling career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Take Action

It is crucial to take action and develop a definitive plan if you are in an unsatisfactory career situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Tolerating a bad situation, such as a toxic work culture, poor pay, or unaligned industries, will only make it harder to change in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Continuously living a lifestyle of dissatisfaction without change is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Working 10, 20, or 30 years in something you are not passionate about is considered awful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

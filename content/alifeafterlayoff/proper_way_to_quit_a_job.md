Brian from Life After Layoff, an HR professional and corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, shares insights on the correct and most proper way to quit a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He has experience with people entering and leaving organizations, and has personally faced the decision to quit a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The goal is to quit in the most graceful possible way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Why Quit Gracefully?

Regardless of the reason for leaving, whether it's a promotional opportunity, career advancement, or exiting a bad situation, the rules for quitting remain the same: leave with grace and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. If you are in a toxic work environment, considering leaving is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Wrong Way to Quit

Storming out, damaging property, or using offensive language is the wrong way to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This approach will likely result in being ineligible for rehire and burning all bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. In some extreme cases, it could even lead to legal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Spectacularly quitting only offers temporary personal satisfaction and can damage your reputation with current and future employers, as well as with colleagues who might see you as a "loose cannon" and be hesitant to refer you for future roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## [[preparation_before_quitting_a_job | Preparation Before Quitting]]

*   **Secure a New Opportunity**
    If you are unsatisfied with your job, boss, or the situation, it's best not to tell anyone you are looking until you have another opportunity lined up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Informing your boss too soon could lead to a faster departure than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It's generally easier to find a new job when you are currently employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Confirm All Details of the New Job**
    Once you have a new job lined up, ensure all your "ducks are in a row" before giving notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This includes having drug screens completed with results back, background checks cleared, references verified, and all pre-employment steps finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Crucially, have a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Giving notice prematurely without these confirmations can result in an offer being pulled due to unforeseen issues (e.g., background check problems), leaving you without a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Background checks can sometimes take several weeks to complete, especially if you have lived in many locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

*   **Maintain Confidentiality**
    It's tempting to share news with close work friends, but it's highly recommended to keep your job search and new opportunity confidential until you are absolutely ready to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. If rumors get out, it can create awkward situations and potentially "bite you" if something unexpected happens with the new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Keep everything discreet and professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## [[communication_with_employer_when_quitting | Notifying Your Boss]]

*   **Set a Meeting**
    Once you have a confirmed start date, schedule a meeting with your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This should be done face-to-face or via a video call (e.g., Zoom), not by email or text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   **Keep it Brief and Professional**
    Provide only the minimum information necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   **Example Script:** "Hey, I just want to let you know that I've got another opportunity that came my way, and it's really the best move for my family. I just wanted to thank you for all the time, but I am giving my two weeks' notice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    *   Avoid elaborating on negative reasons for leaving (e.g., "you're a bad boss," or "I hate the job") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Such discussions can escalate emotions and serve no productive purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Your decision to leave should be firm, and you should not be swayed by counter offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Maintain an "emotion zero point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Take the high road, be courteous, thank them for their time and the opportunity, and give your two weeks' notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Giving Two Weeks' Notice

You should always give two weeks' notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This allows you to tie up loose ends and facilitates a smooth transition for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. While there's no legal requirement to give notice in many places, it's a courtesy primarily for your fellow coworkers and, if applicable, your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. It prevents "screwing over" colleagues who would otherwise have to scramble to cover your workload and reassigned tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Communicating with Coworkers and Clients

*   **Get Your Boss's Blessing:** Let your boss know first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Don't let them find out through the grapevine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. After informing your boss and giving notice, ask them when it is appropriate to start sharing the news with your team members, clients, or customers to discuss a transition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Wait for their green light to follow proper protocol and leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Be Mindful of Impact:** When informing coworkers and clients, remember that your departure will create a workload void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Be graceful and appreciative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

*   **Last Day Huddle:** On your last day, if you work with a local group, call a quick huddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Target influential people and inform them of your departure, citing a better opportunity that is good for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Keep the message positive, expressing enjoyment of working with the team and appreciation for the career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Do not trash the company, job, or boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Building Your Network

Directly contact or call people who were instrumental in your career (e.g., trainers, mentors, those who gave you opportunities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Give them a personal thank you and ask them to join your personal network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Connect with them on LinkedIn to build your professional network, which is a powerful way to find future jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Leaving professionally ensures these networking opportunities will be available to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Maintaining Relationships

It's always better to leave the door cracked open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. You can even ask your current boss if you would be considered for rehire if things don't work out at your new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Maintain good terms with former bosses, as they can serve as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Also, if your former boss moves to another company, they might call you to join their new organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Your [[risks_of_quitting_a_job_without_a_clear_plan | employment brand]] is defined by how you treat people when you leave an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Leave on good terms and leave a great impression, as this will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

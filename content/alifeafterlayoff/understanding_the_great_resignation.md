The [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | Great Resignation]] refers to a phenomenon where people are voluntarily leaving their jobs in mass. This wave is a direct result of global events over the past 18 months leading up to late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is considered a legitimate phenomenon impacting the global workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Key Statistics and Observations

*   **Microsoft Research**: Up to 41% of currently working individuals were planning to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **U.S. Labor Department**: A record four million people voluntarily quit their jobs in April 2021, marking the start of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This statistic is startling given the uncertain labor market at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Job Seeker Poll**: A poll revealed that a majority of respondents were employed but actively considering a job change, indicating widespread dissatisfaction even among those with jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Recruiter's Perspective**: As a recruiter, the speaker observes that a significant number of people seeking career coaching are gainfully employed and have strong career paths, but are dissatisfied with their current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. They are no longer willing to "play the game" with antiquated company practices and seek faster career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift

Several factors contributed to the mass exodus:

### Recalibrated Priorities and Remote Work
The pandemic forced individuals to re-evaluate their lives, realizing how much time was spent commuting and in traditional office settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Commute Time**: Individuals realized the significant time spent on commuting, with some spending 4.5 to 5 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, and that much of the work could be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Stigma of Remote Work**: Before 2020, remote work often carried a stigma, suggesting a lack of dedication or team involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The pandemic disproved this, showing that many positions, especially professional white-collar roles, can be effectively done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Forced Adaptation**: Companies, previously reluctant to adopt remote models, were compelled to adapt quickly in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Homeschooling**: The sudden closure of schools and the need for homeschooling further highlighted the need for workplace flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Corporate Practices and Employee Burnout
*   **Return-to-Office Mandates**: Some CEOs and leadership teams are pushing employees to return to the office without clear business reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, leading to employee frustration.
*   **Location-Based Pay**: Companies proposing to pay remote employees less if they move to a lower cost-of-living area, despite performing the same job, is seen as punitive and illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This is especially questionable when companies save on office space and associated expenses due to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Over-Cutting Staff**: Many companies over-corrected during the pandemic by laying off staff more deeply than necessary, anticipating a greater business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. When the market rebounded faster than expected, remaining employees were burdened with significantly increased workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Digital Exhaustion**: The constant virtual meetings and digital interactions in a work-from-home model led to widespread burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

The current labor market is largely a "buyer's market" for employees, with many positions open and fewer people to fill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Companies with rigid philosophies on return-to-office, remote work, and flexibility are expected to struggle in competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Flexibility and work-life balance are no longer just competitive advantages but have become the expected standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Companies that fail to adapt will be at a competitive disadvantage in recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### The "Employment Experience"
The post-pandemic era is defined by the "employment experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes the way people work and live, including:
*   Productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>
*   Flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>
*   Well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>
*   Career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
*   Work-life balance (avoiding 60-70 hour work weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
*   Full-time employment options over contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
*   Competitive financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>

Companies must offer these elements as part of their benefits package to remain competitive in the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Failing to do so will leave them behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

The [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | Great Resignation]] signals a redefinition of priorities for individuals in the workforce, which will compel companies to adapt, ultimately leading to positive changes in the work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Many are even making complete 180-degree career changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

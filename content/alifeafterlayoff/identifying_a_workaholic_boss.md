A workaholic boss is one of several [[common_types_of_bad_bosses|bad boss types]] employees might encounter in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This type of boss is generally easy to recognize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Workaholic Boss
*   **Extreme Dedication** They are extremely dedicated to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **First In, Last Out** They are often the first person to arrive in the morning and the last person to leave at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Always Working** A key indicator is if they send emails on Saturdays or Sundays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## The Core Problem
While there's nothing inherently wrong with being dedicated to one's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, the issue arises when a workaholic boss expects the same level of dedication from their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This expectation is particularly prevalent when [[common_types_of_bad_bosses|the boss]] is the company owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

As noted by Gary Vaynerchuk (GaryVee), employees will never be as dedicated to the mission as the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Handling a Workaholic Boss
If you find yourself working for a workaholic boss and that level of dedication is not the type of environment you desire, it may be necessary to seek a different opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. While not every bad boss situation means you should quit immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>, it's crucial to have a game plan for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. A steady job should not be an excuse to tolerate a bad work situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

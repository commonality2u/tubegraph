If you have a LinkedIn profile, it's crucial to avoid common mistakes that can limit your career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. For those not yet on the platform, creating a LinkedIn profile is the first essential step to access job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

As a corporate recruiter with two decades of experience, LinkedIn is used extensively to source and find the best candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Recruiters prefer LinkedIn over untargeted job postings because it allows them to narrow down searches and find perfect matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

A recruiter highlights six major mistakes job seekers often make on LinkedIn that could be hindering their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## 1. Not Allowing Contact

LinkedIn has two main interfaces: the familiar front-facing site and "LinkedIn Recruiter," a back-channel system used by recruiters to search the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Recruiters use advanced search strategies, like Boolean searches, to find specific combinations of skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

One of the most frustrating issues for recruiters is finding the perfect candidate but being unable to contact them because they've blocked connections from anyone they don't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This prevents recruiters from reaching out with potential job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

> "If you are not allowing recruiters to contact you about opportunities, then you're potentially missing out on really great options." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

Even if you are a passive candidate (not actively looking for a job), allowing contact is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. While you might receive some unwanted emails, it only takes a few seconds to dismiss them, and it could lead to a valuable opportunity you might otherwise miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Receiving recruiter emails often indicates you are in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## 2. Missing Keywords

Recruiters use keyword strings and advanced search strategies to find targeted profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. If your LinkedIn profile lacks the specific keywords recruiters are searching for, you won't appear in their search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

> "Essentially what you should be doing is loading down your LinkedIn profile with all the keywords that I might be looking for as a recruiter." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>

To identify relevant keywords, keep a pulse on your industry and include skills commonly sought for positions in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The more relevant keywords you add, the easier it will be for recruiters to find and contact you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## 3. Not Being Active

Even with a well-optimized profile and open contact settings, if you're not active on LinkedIn, you might miss messages and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It's important to check your messages regularly or set up notifications to an email address you frequently check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. You can adjust LinkedIn settings to receive only direct emails rather than all network notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Being active also means seeing high-quality job opportunities that recruiters repost or that appear in your feed from your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Staying engaged with the platform, especially in white-collar professions, allows you to observe industry trends, what others are working on, and maintain a professional presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## 4. Not Networking

A common mistake is having a limited network, often less than 100 connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. A small network can suggest inactivity and a lack of investment in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. LinkedIn allows for a large number of connections (tens of thousands), so there's no reason not to expand your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Building a larger network increases your visibility and branding opportunities, leading to more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Start by connecting with:
*   Former employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Previous bosses and close colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>
*   Local industry professionals in similar roles or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>

These targeted networks can lead to direct job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Aim for a minimum of 500+ connections on your profile, as this is where LinkedIn stops showing an exact count and simply displays "500+" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## 5. Being a Lurker

Simply having connections isn't enough; you must engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. If you never engage on others' posts or create your own content, your name won't be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. A large network with no engagement translates to no professional brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Engaging by leaving thoughtful comments and creating good content builds your "employment brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Recruiters, who are often on LinkedIn daily, notice active and engaged members <a class="yt=timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

If you're new to engagement, start small:
*   Engage on one post a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>
*   Put out two or three posts a week, or even just one post a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>

Consistent engagement can yield surprising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## 6. Engaging in Controversial Discussions

Avoid getting involved in controversial discussions on LinkedIn, particularly regarding politics, religion, or non-work-related belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Arguing publicly can be seen by hundreds of thousands of people in your network and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Associating your professional brand with such discussions can create a negative impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. While having your own opinions is fine, LinkedIn is not the appropriate platform for getting on a "soapbox" about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

> "Keep it work related, keep it above the cuff and keep it professional." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>

Recruiters may judge your behavior, wondering if you would bring such arguments into an office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Be cautious about the content you engage with to maintain a professional image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

By avoiding these six common mistakes, job seekers can significantly improve their LinkedIn presence and increase their chances of landing new career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

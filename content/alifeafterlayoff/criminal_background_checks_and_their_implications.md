When a job offer is extended, it is almost always contingent upon the successful completion of a [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Employers typically outsource the [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] process to a third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. An authorization form is usually signed after the offer letter, allowing the company to conduct a criminal [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Components of a Criminal Background Check

The criminal [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] generally focuses on two major areas: felonies and misdemeanors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

*   **Felonies**
    A felony conviction is considered much more serious and can be a significant barrier to employment for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. If a felony occurred more than seven years ago, it might still be flagged, and the employer will need to decide whether to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Misdemeanors**
    A misdemeanor is a less serious criminal conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Generally, a misdemeanor alone will not prevent someone from getting a job, but the specific nature of the conviction is considered on a case-by-case basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Human Resources department makes the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Pending Court Cases and Active Warrants**
    Employers will also check for pending court cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Additionally, criminal [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background checks]] can reveal active warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**
    Typically, criminal [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background checks]] go back about seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Juvenile Infractions**
    Criminal [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background checks]] generally do not report on juvenile infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Verification Process

To verify criminal backgrounds, third-party companies examine all locations where an applicant has lived for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. They contact local courthouses in each of those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Delays in the process are often due to courthouses, especially older ones that may still rely on physical files rather than electronic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Importance of Disclosure

If an applicant has a criminal background, it is advisable to disclose it at the time of the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This ensures transparency, prevents surprises, and provides the employer with a full understanding of the situation before the [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] is conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Similarly, any potential red flags in an applicant's background should be disclosed early in the offer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Consequences of Failing a Criminal Background Check

If an applicant fails the criminal [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]], the employer receives a detailed report listing what was verified or what could not be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Exceptions are usually noted and explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. At this point, the employer may either ask the applicant for further verification or potentially withdraw the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. It is in the applicant's best interest to respond proactively to help the company obtain the necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Falsifying information on a [[importance_of_honesty_in_job_applications_and_potential_consequences_of_falsifying_information | job application]], which is considered a legal document, can lead to termination for cause, even after employment has begun, if the employer later verifies credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Lying about credentials or having someone falsely act as an employment verifier can lead to the job offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Being forthcoming with one's background and ensuring all stated credentials are accurate is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, but certain interview questions can signal that an employer might be [[low_quality_employers | low quality]] or have an ulterior motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. By paying close attention to these [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]] during the interview process, you can discern whether an opportunity is worth pursuing or if it's best to [[tips_for_avoiding_lowquality_employers | walk away]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Specific Interview Questions to Watch For

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
While seemingly innocent, this question can indicate a hyper-focus on attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. It suggests the employer has likely dealt with attendance issues previously and will be overly particular about attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This can imply an inflexible workplace and a culture where employees might face repercussions for calling off sick, even if they don't abuse attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

> üí° If asked this question, consider asking the interviewer about their expectations around unplanned absences. If they indicate a strict crackdown, it may point to a toxic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
This question can indicate that the employer is trying to determine "how cheap" they can acquire your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. It suggests a lack of flexibility in compensation and implies that the company will likely attempt to lowball you from the start. This could lead to struggles in maintaining a competitive salary or receiving promotions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
This question can be a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] for potential turnover issues within the company or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. If an employer needs to ask this, it suggests people are leaving quickly, indicating a possible larger cultural problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. The focus on length of stay over potential success in the role can also reflect an employer's bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### "Have you ever been fired?"
An employer's inquiry into whether you've been fired is generally not their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Past employment status, particularly an adverse employment decision, is not always the best indicator of future performance, as it could have been a bad situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

> üó£Ô∏è If this question comes up, consider redirecting the conversation to focus on your accomplishments and future ability to do the job. If the interviewer persists, withdrawing your candidacy might be advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

### Accusation of Exaggerating or Embellishing Your Resume
Assuming your resume is accurate, an interviewer accusing you of exaggerating or embellishing it indicates a fundamental lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This suggests the employer assumes applicants are lying or has a general distrust towards candidates. This behavior is a strong indicator of a toxic work environment and an unhealthy company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
This question is often seen as a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. While the intent might be to understand how you overcome adversity, focusing on past failures can lead to biases against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. There are better ways for an employer to phrase questions about problem-solving or resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

> üìù If you must answer, focus briefly on the failure and then emphasize how you overcame the adversity, turning it into a positive lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Asking About Availability for Off-Shifts/Weekends (for a primary shift role) or On-Site (for a remote role)
For roles with a primary shift, being asked about availability for off-shifts or weekends, especially for hourly positions, can indicate that you will likely be working unwanted overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This points to a potential work-life imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

Similarly, if a remote job posting involves questions about your availability to come on-site regularly, it's not truly a remote job but a hybrid position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. If pitched as fully remote but operating as hybrid, there's a high likelihood it could eventually transition to a full-time in-office role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
This question is a significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] because it immediately suggests that the workplace has existing issues with rude colleagues or managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. If rudeness is an acknowledged issue, it indicates a cultural problem that could make the job challenging and undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

### Lack of Opportunity for You to Ask Questions
If, at the end of the interview, the interviewer does not provide an opportunity for you to ask your own questions, or if they dominate the entire conversation, it is a significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. An interview should be a two-way street where you also assess the company and the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. If an employer takes offense to you asking questions, it suggests they believe they are "above you" and should not be assessed, indicating an undesirable company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While one or two of these questions might not definitively label a company as [[low_quality_job_postings | poor quality]], they serve as important [[red_flags_in_job_applications | data points]] that indicate potential underlying cultural issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Always ask good probing questions to ensure you fully understand what you're getting into before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

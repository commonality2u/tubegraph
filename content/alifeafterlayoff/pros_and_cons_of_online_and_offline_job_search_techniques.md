A corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience interviewing and hiring thousands of people for major companies has ranked 15 different job search methods by their effectiveness, from least to most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The ranking is subjective, based on personal experience, and assumes the job seeker wants to secure a job quickly with the best return on investment for their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Each method is assigned a score between 1 and 10, with 10 being the best "bang for your buck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>.

## Least Effective Job Search Techniques (Score 1-3)

### Cold Calling (Score: 1/10)
Cold calling involves soliciting a job without knowing if the employer has an opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. This can include physically dropping in unannounced, calling switchboards to ask for HR, or sending unsolicited notes on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Type**: Primarily offline, but can have online components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>.
*   **Cons**: As a corporate recruiter, this method "almost never works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a> and is generally not a good use of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:07">[02:23:07]</a>.

### Social Media Engagement (Score: 1/10)
Engaging with a company's social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) in hopes of being noticed by a hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.
*   **Type**: Online.
*   **Cons**: The chances of this leading to an interview are "very very slim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>. HR and talent acquisition typically do not manage social media; marketing departments usually handle it, especially in larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>. Recruiters rarely see engagement from job seekers on these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

Attending job fairs, often organized by unemployment centers or universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>.
*   **Type**: Offline.

The recruiter has hired people from job fairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:09">[03:54:09]</a>.
*   **Cons**: From an employer's perspective, finding a well-qualified candidate is "pretty slim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:04">[04:03:04]</a>. Job seekers face stiff competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:07">[04:48:07]</a>, and it's generally an "untargeted way to look for a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:06">[05:01:06]</a>.

*   **Cons**: Generally an "untargeted way to look for a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:01">[05:31:01]</a>, often involves awkward small talk, and the chances of someone having an immediate, suitable job opening are slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:03">[05:40:03]</a>.

*   **Cons**: Not very [[effective_job_search_strategies | targeted recruiting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:05">[06:37:05]</a>. If an employer responds to a job seeker's post, it often turns into a "feeding frenzy" with high competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:08">[06:51:08]</a>. Building a knowledge repository on these platforms is not the best use of time for quick job placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

*   **Cons**: Once you're not a fit for the primary role, their interest tends to "fizzle pretty quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. Job seekers should still take ownership of their search and not solely rely on agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

### Personal Website/Blog (Score: 5/10)

*   **Cons**: Takes effort to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a> and does not offer immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:08">[11:34:08]</a>.

Some jobs receive very few applicants, allowing good candidates to be seen quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
*   **Cons**: High competition; job seekers don't know how they stack up against others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Many applicants may not be well-aligned with the role, leading to low fill rates from postings (5-10% for the recruiter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. Requires significant effort, applying to many positions, and navigating "hoops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

*   **Pros**: Recruiters fill "80 percent or more" of their jobs through this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

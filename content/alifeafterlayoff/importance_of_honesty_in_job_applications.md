Securing a job offer is a significant achievement, but it's often contingent upon successfully clearing a background check. The foundation of this process, and indeed your entire professional relationship with a potential employer, rests on the honesty and accuracy of your job application. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

## The Job Application: A Legal Document
The job application submitted through an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is considered a legal document. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> Many applications require a certification that all information provided is correct and accurate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> Once hired, this application becomes a permanent part of your employment record, and it typically includes a section authorizing the employer to conduct a background check upon a job offer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

## The Background Check Process
Employers typically outsource background checks to third-party companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> These companies verify the information provided on your application against various resources. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

### What Employers Verify
*   **Employment Records**: This is often initiated through databases like "Work Number," where millions of employers submit employee information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> They confirm if you actually worked for the company, the dates of employment, and the titles you held. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   **Job Titles**: While minor adjustments to job titles to align with industry standards might not be a major issue, drastically changing your title to imply a different level (e.g., from an individual contributor to a director) could pose significant problems and likely be a major [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
*   **Dates of Employment**: Falsifying employment dates to give yourself additional experience is not recommended. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   **Criminal Background**: Checks typically cover felonies and misdemeanors, usually going back about seven years, though felonies from earlier periods may still be flagged. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> They also check for active warrants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> It's always better to disclose any criminal background at the time of the offer to avoid surprises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
*   **Education Verification**: Employers verify claimed schools, degrees, and certifications by contacting educational institutions directly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> Claiming certifications you don't possess (e.g., a CPA license) will be flagged. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

## Consequences of Dishonesty
A discrepancy between your background and what you put on your job application can lead to serious repercussions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

*   **Offer Rescinded**: If the background check reveals inconsistencies, the job offer can be pulled. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
*   **Termination for Cause**: Even if you are hired, if an employer later discovers you lied about your credentials, you can be terminated for cause. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

It is crucial to be proactive in responding to requests for information to help the company verify your background. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>

## Recommendation: Be Forthcoming
It is generally recommended not to lie on your resume or job application. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> Given that the job application is a legal document, think carefully before falsifying anything. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> Attempting to have a friend or relative act as an employment verifier for a past job is a highly risky endeavor that can lead to your offer being rescinded. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>

The best approach is to be forthcoming with your background and ensure that you genuinely possess the credentials you claim. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> This honesty is fundamental to your success in the [[job_application_pitfalls_and_tips | job application process]] and your future career.

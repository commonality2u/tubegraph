When a recruiter asks about your [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectation]] in an interview, the way you respond is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. An incorrect answer can lead to rejection, as can avoiding the question entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide provides insight into [[strategies_for_handling_salary_discussions_during_job_interviews | how to answer the salary expectation question]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters typically ask about [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectations]] towards the end of an interview, especially for candidates they are interested in moving to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The primary reason is to determine if your expectations align with the company's established salary band for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This information is usually included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

It's generally not a trick question; recruiters genuinely want to know your [[salary_expectations and negotiation in interviews | salary expectation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The goal is to ensure that if an offer is extended, you will not only accept it but also be excited and feel satisfied with the compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Offering a salary below your expectation can lead to dissatisfaction, causing you to seek other opportunities, and employers want to avoid refilling positions shortly after hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The salary question is important for both the candidate and the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Scenarios When Discussing Salary Expectations

### Your Salary Expectation is Higher Than the Range

If your [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectation]] is too high for the role, you risk being removed from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, if the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000), there might be room for [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_employers | negotiation]] even before further interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Recruiters might propose hypothetical scenarios or different compensation packages to gauge your flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

For a significant difference (e.g., $25,000), a recruiter will likely inform you that the expectations don't align for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They might ask to keep you in mind for more enriched future roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

In rare cases, if you are a "superstar candidate," a recruiter might still submit your resume with your higher [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectations]] to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The hiring manager might then consider enriching the role to a higher level (e.g., Level 2 or 3) to open up wider salary ranges and accommodate your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This is the exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Always be honest with your expectations; attempting a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Your Salary Expectation is Lower Than the Range

When your [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectation]] is lower than the company's salary band for the role, it's generally a favorable situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Major corporations have defined salary bands (minimum, midpoint, max) based on local market wage surveys and internal equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Internal equity ensures that individuals in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

If your compensation expectation is below the lowest point of the company's range, you will automatically be raised to that minimum point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This often occurs when candidates come from smaller or less reputable companies that may not pay market value, or when stepping into a next-level role with a significant salary gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Refusing to Answer the Question

Ambiguity or refusing to provide a clear answer to the [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectation]] question will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Recruiters will not put you through the interview process with their team if they don't know if a deal can be finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Such evasiveness can also make recruiters suspect you are hiding something, casting doubt on your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## How to Prepare Your Answer

To effectively answer the [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectation]] question, you need to know three key things:

1.  **Average Salary Range for the Role in the Open Market** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>: Conduct research using tools like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Look at recently posted similar roles and ensure you compare salaries in your local area, as regional differences can be significant (e.g., Alabama vs. Bay Area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **What the Company is Expecting to Pay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>: While not always explicitly stated, recruiters may provide hints or ranges.
3.  **Your Absolute Bottom Line Salary Expectation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>: This is the minimum you are willing to accept, the point at which you would walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. While you don't necessarily share this number with the recruiter, you need to know it yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## [[Strategies for answering salary expectation questions | Strategies for Answering]]

Here are a few [[strategies_for_answering_salary_expectation_questions | ways to answer]] the [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectation]] question:

### 1. Give Your Expectation Directly

If you know your worth and are confident that the company's range is in the same ballpark, feel free to state your actual number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Remember that this number will be used throughout the hiring process, so ensure it's reasonable and something you can live with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### 2. Frame Your Answer Based on Market Research

If you are concerned the company might lowball you or your expectations are significantly higher, frame your answer like this:

> "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110 thousand. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

This approach puts the onus on the company to disclose if they are paying below market value, allowing you to decide if you still want to work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### 3. Turn the Question Back to the Recruiter

If you are interested in the opportunity and potentially willing to take a lower salary but want to avoid pricing yourself out, try asking the recruiter first:

> "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

Recruiters will often share what other candidates are being compensated at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. If they push back and insist you answer first, still have a prepared answer, but avoid completely dodging the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Important Considerations

*   **Avoid Ambiguity**: Do not go through the interview process with ambiguous salary expectations, hoping to [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_employers | negotiate]] at the offer stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This often annoys hiring managers who have invested time, especially if they cannot meet your higher expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Don't Frustrate the Recruiter**: If you sense a recruiter is becoming frustrated with your evasiveness, simply provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Pushing it too far can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Landing an interview means you are already doing something right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Knowing [[how_to_prepare_for_salary_discussions_in_interviews | how to prepare for salary discussions in interviews]] and how to handle the compensation question is key to securing your dream job and [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_employers | negotiating the perfect salary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

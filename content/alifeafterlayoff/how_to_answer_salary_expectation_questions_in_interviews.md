The question "What's your salary expectation?" is a common and often dreaded part of the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Answering incorrectly can lead to rejection, as can avoiding the question altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article provides guidance on how to best approach and [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | navigate salary expectation questions]] in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters typically ask about your salary expectations towards the end of an initial interview, especially if they are interested in moving you to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The primary reasons include:

*   **Fit within Salary Band** Recruiters need to determine if your expectations fit within the established salary band for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This data is included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Satisfaction** The question is not a trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Recruiters genuinely want to know your expectations to ensure that if an offer is extended, you will not only accept but also be excited about the position and feel you received a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Accepting a salary below your expectations often leads to dissatisfaction and looking for other opportunities, which means the company may have to refill the position quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Mutual Benefit** The [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | salary question]] is important for both the candidate and the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While some low-quality employers might try to lowball an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, reputable employers typically want to find a mutually agreeable compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. If your realistic [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | salary expectations]] scare them away, it's likely not an employer you'd want to work for anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Scenarios for Salary Expectations

### Your Salary Expectation is Higher Than the Range

If your expected salary is too high for the role, you might be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Small Gap (e.g., $10,000 difference)**: There might be some negotiation even before the full interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. A recruiter might offer hypothetical scenarios to gauge your flexibility or suggest a different offer structure that could still meet your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Large Gap (e.g., $25,000 difference)**: Realistically, an offer might not be feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The recruiter might indicate that expectations don't align and ask to keep you in mind for a future, more enriched role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidate**: If you are highly talented and a perfect fit, a recruiter might still send your resume to the hiring manager with your higher expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In some cases, the hiring manager might enrich the role (e.g., make it a level 2 or 3 position) to open up wider salary ranges and accommodate a higher compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, this is an exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3">**Warning:** Be honest with your expectations; trying a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.</mark>

### Your Salary Expectation is Lower Than the Range

This is a favorable situation for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If your compensation expectation is below the company's lowest point of the range, you will automatically be raised to that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

*   **Corporate Salary Bands**: Major corporations use salary bands, which define minimum, midpoint, and maximum compensation for a role, typically based on local market wage surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Internal Equity**: Companies also consider internal equity, ensuring that individuals in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This prevents a new entry-level person from earning significantly more than experienced employees in similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Common Scenarios**: This situation often occurs when a candidate comes from a less reputable or smaller company that doesn't have comparable salary bands, or when stepping into a next-level role where there's a gap from their previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Refusing to Answer the Question

Ambiguity or refusing to provide a salary expectation will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Recruiters will not put you through a full interview process without confidence that a deal can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. It can also make recruiters think you are hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## [[preparing_for_salary_expectation_questions | Preparing for Salary Expectation Questions]]

To effectively [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_recruiters | negotiate salary expectations]] and answer the question, you need to know three key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:

1.  **Average Salary Range in the Open Market**:
    *   Research tools like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   Look at similar roles posted recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Be realistic and compare jobs in your local area, as salaries vary significantly by region (e.g., Alabama vs. Bay Area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **What the Company Expects to Pay**: This is often harder to pinpoint but can be inferred from your research and direct questions.
3.  **Your Bottom Line Salary Expectation**:
    *   This is the absolute minimum you would accept to walk away from other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   You don't necessarily share this number with the recruiter, but you must know it for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_salary_negotiation | Strategies for Salary Negotiation]]

Once you have your research complete, here are ways to answer [[commonly_asked_interview_questions | commonly asked interview questions]] regarding salary:

### 1. Directly State Your Expectation

If you know your worth and are confident the company is in a similar salary ballpark, you can simply state your desired number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Ensure this number is reasonable and something you can commit to throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### 2. Frame it with Market Research

If you suspect the company might offer a lowball salary, or you're worried about being significantly above their expectations, frame your answer based on market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:

> "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between [lower end] to [higher end]. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

This puts the onus on the company to disclose if they are paying below market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, allowing you to decide if you want to proceed.

### 3. Put the Question Back on the Recruiter

If you're concerned about pricing yourself out of an opportunity you're genuinely interested in, and might be willing to take a lower salary for, try this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>:

> "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>

A recruiter might respond with the compensation range they're looking at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. If they push back and insist you answer first, still have an answer prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Key Considerations

*   **Avoid Ambiguity**: Never try to be ambiguous or vague with your salary expectations, hoping to negotiate only at the offer stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This often annoys hiring managers who have invested time in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Don't Push Too Hard**: If a recruiter becomes frustrated with your hedging, just provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Pushing too hard on this point can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

<mark style="background: #BBF3D6">**Tip:** Getting to the interview stage means you're doing something right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

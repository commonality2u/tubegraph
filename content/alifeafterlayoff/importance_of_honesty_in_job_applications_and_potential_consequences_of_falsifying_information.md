An offer of employment is almost always contingent upon the successful completion of a background check and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. If there are discrepancies between what is stated on the job application and the background check results, an applicant could lose their job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Job Application as a Legal Document
The job application submitted through an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is considered a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It often includes a certification requiring the applicant to confirm that all information provided is correct and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This application becomes a permanent part of an employment record once hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## What Employers Verify in a Background Check
Employers typically outsource the background check process to a third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This company verifies the applicant's information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Employment History
Background checks verify employment records by searching databases, such as Work Number, and by contacting current or most recent employers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Work Number is a database where millions of employers submit employee information, including employment records and sometimes income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The main aspects checked for employment verification are:
*   Confirmation of employment at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
*   Dates of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
*   Titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

Employers generally do not check previous income, as it is becoming an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Most background checks go back approximately seven to ten years, though some may check an applicant's entire work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

#### Job Titles
Minor adjustments to job titles to make them more commonly accepted within an industry are generally not a concern during a background check, as long as the level of the title remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. For example, changing "talent acquisition specialist" to "recruiter" would not be an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

However, altering a job title to imply a completely different level, such as claiming to be a "director of talent acquisition" when one was an individual contributor, would be a major [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] and could cause significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

#### Employment Dates
Falsifying employment dates to add extra work experience that an applicant does not truly possess is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Criminal Background
Criminal background checks usually focus on felonies and misdemeanors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Felonies**: A felony conviction is more serious and can be a barrier to employment for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Misdemeanors**: A misdemeanor is a less serious conviction and generally won't prevent employment, but this is assessed on a case-by-case basis by the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Criminal checks typically go back about seven years, but felony convictions from further back may still be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. They also check for pending court cases and active warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Juvenile infractions are usually not reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Criminal background verification involves contacting local courthouses in all locations where the applicant has lived for a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Delays often occur on the court's side due to antiquated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Education and Certifications
Education verification confirms that an applicant attended the claimed school, obtained the stated degree, and holds any professional certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This includes high school, college, and specific licenses like a CPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Verification is done by contacting the university directly, a process that is typically quick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## The Importance of Honesty
It is crucial to be honest about qualifications and accomplishments on a job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Falsifying Information**: If an employer discovers that an applicant has lied on their resume or application, even after they have been hired, they can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This highlights the [[consequences_of_inconsistencies_and_dishonesty_in_resumes | temptation and consequences of lying on a resume]] and the [[areas_where_lying_on_a_resume_is_unacceptable | impact of dishonesty in job applications]].
*   **Proactive Disclosure**: If an applicant has anything in their background that might flag during a check, it is better to disclose it early during the offer process to ensure transparency and avoid surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Responding to Flags**: If an exception is noted in the background check report, it is in the applicant's best interest to respond proactively and help the company verify the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Buddy" References**: Having a friend or family member pose as an employment verifier is a significant risk that could lead to an offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The employer can and will conduct their own verification.

Being forthcoming with one's background and ensuring that stated credentials are accurate is the recommended approach for successful job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

When writing a resume, certain elements should be left off to ensure it stands out and makes a strong first impression on recruiters and hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A clean, concise, and well-crafted resume is crucial, especially in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Graphics and Colors to Avoid

To avoid common mistakes and ensure your resume is effective, steer clear of the following:

### Bright Graphics or Excessive Colors
Avoid including any bright graphics or overly vibrant colors in your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While some color is acceptable—such as using a different color for a job title—stick to simple choices like blues, blacks, or possibly magenta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The primary goal is to keep the resume clean and concise, avoiding distractions that could shift the focus away from assessing your background and fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Graphs, Charts, or Clip Art
Your resume is a professional document, and including graphs, charts, or clip art can lead to negative judgment, even if you perceive them as "cute" or personality-showing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The only exception for using unique and splashy graphics is if you are in a creative field, such as an art director or graphic designer, where demonstrating creativity visually is an expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For almost every other career type, it's best to keep it simple and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Infographics for Skill Proficiency
Resist the temptation to use infographics, such as bar charts, to demonstrate proficiency in certain skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. While seemingly effective, indicating a low proficiency (e.g., "3 out of 10") can inadvertently highlight a weakness in a skill that might be important to the employer, potentially eliminating you from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It is generally better to allow the employer to assess your skill level during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If a skill is in high demand, focus on improving it rather than showcasing a low proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Being vague in this regard is advisable, but always avoid lying or misrepresenting your actual skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Columns
Avoid using multiple columns on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) typically parse information from left to right, and while many are sophisticated, they can struggle with reading columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This means if you list skills in columns, the ATS might only read the first column, making other relevant skills invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This can prevent recruiters from finding your resume through keyword searches later on, making you "invisible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The solution is simple: remove columns entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

As a recruiter and career coach, Brian from Life After Layoff emphasizes that the primary goal of a resume is to quickly capture the attention of the person screening it, ensuring it gets called for a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The aim is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

## Resume Presentation and Templates

Many job seekers need to improve their resume presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Recruiters typically give a resume about a 5-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

### Outdated Templates to Avoid
*   **Graphic-heavy templates** often found on sites like Canva.com or large industry resume hubs are generally a bad idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   These templates include graphics, charts, and "cute presentation" that distract from the main purpose of quickly finding relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   They are frequently designed by individuals who do not understand how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) parse resumes, making them ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Recommended Template Features
*   **Simplicity:** A very simple template from Microsoft Word is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Single-column layout:** Choose templates with one column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Minimalist design:** Avoid bright, flashy colors and graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Legible fonts:** Ensure fonts are clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Color palette:** Stick to basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   For most professions, a resume should be "relatively boring" in its design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The only exception is for graphic designers or those in creative fields where a more creative approach might be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### ATS Compliance for Contact Information
*   **Vertical alignment:** Contact information should be presented vertically, not horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. ATS systems typically do not read horizontal information well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, whereas vertical placement allows the ATS to find and correctly parse the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Troubleshooting:** If you find yourself manually entering your name, phone number, and address when applying, your resume is likely not [[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | ATS compliant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Content and Language

### Profile, Don't Summarize
*   Instead of writing a resume as a summary of all past accomplishments, think about "profiling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted approach:** Profile for a specific role, delivering exactly what the employer is looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   Focus on what hiring teams actually care about, not accomplishments irrelevant to the specific job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Conciseness and Word Choice
*   Avoid being overly wordy; large blocks of text cause eyes to "glaze over" and are often skipped by recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   Be concise and selective with your words and how they are laid out on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Language to Avoid
*   **Proprietary language:** Remove company-specific titles, project names, division names, or product types that are only known within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
    *   Boil down concepts into clear, common language for the industry you are applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
*   **Generic, fluffy terminology:** Eliminate phrases like "team player" or "great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
    *   Such competencies are typically assessed in an interview anyway, and your resume is unlikely to convey them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
    *   Focus on more actionable terms and concepts related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Adaptability and Customization

*   Stop being "lazy" with [[customizing_your_resume_for_specific_job_applications | customization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   [[customizing_your_resume_for_specific_job_applications | Customization]] is crucial, especially for competitive remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   By customizing your resume, you gain a competitive advantage over others who do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   If your resume is not getting the desired results (i.e., you're repeatedly rejected at the application level), it's crucial to revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   Continuously doing the same thing and expecting different results is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   Be realistic about your fit for jobs you apply to, and ensure your resume clearly conveys that fit to give yourself the best chance of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   If results are lacking, "plan, do, check, and adjust" â€“ make changes, mix it up, and try different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

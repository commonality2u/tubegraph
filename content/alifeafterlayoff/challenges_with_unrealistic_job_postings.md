Job seekers often feel that employer requirements are completely out of touch, a sentiment supported by the existence of "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These hidden requirements, which are typically more specific and demanding than publicly advertised roles, contribute to the [[challenges_with_job_application_processes_and_employer_expectations | challenges with job application processes and employer expectations]] and a pervasive sense of frustration in the [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | current job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## The Nature of Hidden Job Requirements

Hidden job requirements are internal selection guidelines provided by hiring authorities, typically the hiring manager, to recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These guidelines are not usually shared with job candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. When a job requisition opens, the hiring manager and recruiter discuss "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

While "must-haves" often include objective criteria like years of experience or degree requirements, the "prefers" list is where hiring manager bias often becomes evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Recruiters, especially junior ones, may not push back on unrealistic demands, leading to highly restrictive candidate searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Case Study: An Extreme Example of Hidden Requirements

An accidental email from a recruiter revealed a company's "secret internal selection guidelines" for a software development role, highlighting the [[absurd_job_requirements_and_postings | absurd job requirements and postings]] that can exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This internal memo detailed specific, often unreasonable, preferences and exclusions:

### What They Were Looking For:

*   **Education**:
    *   Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science from a "top program" (e.g., MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, University of Waterloo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   A special exception might be made for 4.0 graduates from a couple of other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Experience**:
    *   4 to 10 years of software development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Longevity in role, requiring 2+ years in each position, actively discouraging "job hopping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   Significant experience in notable startups, particularly those backed by firms like Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Technical Skills**: Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), knowledge of modern tech like Kotlin, AI, and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Demographics/Background**:
    *   Bonus for diversity hires (e.g., Black, female) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   Must be a US citizen, permanent resident, green card holder, or Canadian citizen; no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   Bonus points for being a founding engineer or having founder experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### What They Explicitly Wanted to Avoid (Red Flags for the Hiring Manager):

These criteria serve as [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags in job postings]] and candidate profiles, even if they aren't explicit in the public advertisement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Visa Candidates**: Absolutely no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Career Contractors**: Candidates who have worked as career contractors or have any contract work in their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Job Hoppers**: Individuals with frequent, short stints in roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Coding Boot Camp Graduates**: Candidates from coding boot camps like Full Stack Academy or Hacked Reactor were explicitly not considered capable of coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Consulting Background**: Those who worked at IT software development firms rather than directly at product-producing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Big Company Experience Only**: Candidates with experience limited to large companies like Uber, Intel, or Google would be rejected if they didn't also have startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This highlights the [[the_reality_of_startup_job_postings | reality of startup job postings]] versus larger corporate roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Blacklisted Companies**: Candidates who have ever worked at specific companies (e.g., Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, Dell) were deemed "scarlet-lettered" and would never be hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Fake Profiles**: Recruiters were instructed to screen candidates properly due to the increase in [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience | fake job postings and candidate experience]] and scam profiles, especially with mass AI-driven applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Impact on Recruitment and Candidates

This level of detailed and often contradictory demands makes the recruiter's job significantly more difficult, limiting the candidate pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. It justifies the frustration job seekers feel when facing [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | common red flags in job advertisements]] and seemingly impossible requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Such positions may remain open indefinitely because a "qualified" candidate meeting all these unrealistic criteria is virtually impossible to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Advice for Job Seekers Navigating Unrealistic Postings

When encountering such [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | challenges in hiring and recruitment]]:

*   **Don't Blame Yourself**: Understand that often, it's the employer's unrealistic expectations, not your capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Optimize Your Application**: Present a clean, direct resume, engage in targeted networking, and consider creating a portfolio or GitHub to showcase your skills and fit, especially in technical roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control**: The best defense is to avoid subjecting yourself to these types of restrictive rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. If no one applies to these [[job_application_challenges_and_solutions | low-quality employers]], they will eventually be forced to adjust their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

A video recently went viral featuring an account executive from Cloudflare who filmed her own layoff, highlighting issues with how [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | companies handle layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, particularly those that "can't seem to handle them in a proper fashion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The incident brought into focus the common, often "icky," experiences people have with [[corporate_layoffs_and_employee_treatment | corporate layoffs and employee treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Layoff Meeting Scenario

The account executive, a relatively new hire of only a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, was called into an unexpected meeting. Having noticed her colleagues receiving similar invites, she anticipated the reason and decided to record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The sudden, random 15-minute calendar invites for an entire team are a familiar precursor to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

A key indicator of an impending termination is the unexpected presence of HR on the call, especially if an employee has never interacted with them before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. In this case, two unknown individuals, one from HR named Rosie and a director, joined the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The company proceeded to conduct these meetings back-to-back, moving from person to person in a "ruthless" manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Face-to-Face Notifications
> While the process was cold, it was noted that at least the layoffs were conducted face-to-face, rather than through mass emails, Slack messages, or employees discovering they cannot access their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## HR's Communication and Stated Reasons

The stated reason for the account executive's layoff was not meeting "Cloudflare performance standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This claim was made despite the employee having just completed a three-month ramp-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, followed by only two productive weeks in December, sandwiched between major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. She highlighted her high activity, contracts sent out, and consistent positive feedback from her manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Disconnect with Management
> Often, managers are unaware of layoff decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Layoff decisions are typically made by higher-level management and HR, using spreadsheets and data points in a "cold and calculated" manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This impersonal approach clashes with the relationship-oriented nature of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

The employee challenged why she was being laid off by individuals she had never met, questioning why her manager was not involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. When it was clarified that she was not being singled out and that her peers were also "collectively assessed on [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, the rationale of individual performance standards seemed contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It was suggested that companies should be honest about changes in business direction rather than fabricating [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | performance-related excuses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The HR representatives consistently avoided giving specific reasons for the layoff, stating they could not go into specifics or provide data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This vagueness suggests that they may not have concrete data or are intentionally being non-committal to avoid legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The use of performance as a reason could potentially impact an employee's future rehire eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## Severance Agreements and Employee Rights

During a layoff, companies often present a severance agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Signing this agreement typically releases the company from liability, preventing an employee from pursuing legal action for unfair treatment or discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> [!TIP] Severance Agreement Advice
> *   Never sign a severance agreement on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
> *   Read through it very carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
> *   If you feel unfairly targeted, consult with an attorney before signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
> *   Companies will always give you time to consider it, despite any pressure to sign immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## [[Organizational_and_morale_impacts_of_layoffs | Impact of Layoffs on Employees]] and HR's Detachment

The employee expressed the [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | traumatizing effect]] of being fired with no explanation, emphasizing how it "completely wreck[s] their whole life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This kind of interaction highlights a perceived lack of empathy from HR, who can deliver such news multiple times a day without apparent consequence to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The language used by HR in these situations is often "targeted and calculated and very non-committal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, prioritizing legal protection over clear communication.

## Corporate Accountability and [[Hidden_costs_of_layoffs | Hidden Costs of Layoffs]]

The CEO of Cloudflare publicly acknowledged the viral video, stating it was "very painful to watch" but did not change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This highlights a broader issue: those who make decisions to over-hire are rarely the ones who face the consequences of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. If an organization hires many people only to terminate them a few months later, the planners of the headcount should be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, as their "incompetence" in workforce planning contributes to these [[departmental_shifts_and_strategic_direction_in_layoffs | situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

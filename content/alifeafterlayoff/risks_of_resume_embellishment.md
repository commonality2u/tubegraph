Resume embellishment, or fabricating and exaggerating details on your resume, is a significant [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] for potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While candidates might use this tactic to try and generate more interview calls, it carries substantial risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Exposure During Interviews

A primary risk is being exposed during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This often occurs during technical interviews where candidates are asked to demonstrate experience that they have overstated on their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The candidate may then "flounder" when asked to prove their claimed skills in front of interviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Loss of Trust and Credibility

When a candidate's experience doesn't align with their resume, employers will begin to question everything else stated during the interview and on the resume itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Even a minor embellishment can lead to all other claims being doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Getting Caught in a Lie

Being caught in a direct lie is a sure sign of a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Lying about technical experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Candidates may be exposed when asked to demonstrate proficiency they don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Lying about reasons for leaving a previous job**, especially regarding termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. While it's understandable that no one wants to admit being fired, lying about it is not the correct approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. A better strategy is to acknowledge what happened and demonstrate lessons learned from the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

> "If you put one a little embellishment in there it now causes them to question everything else in the interview and you have to ask if it's worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>

## Best Practices for Resume Content

To avoid these pitfalls, it's crucial to write an accurate resume that reflects the job you are applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This approach increases the likelihood of securing a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

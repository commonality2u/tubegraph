To advance your [[career_management_and_development | career]], it's beneficial to start acting more selfishly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means always prioritizing your best interests first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The concept of being a [[career_management_and_being_a_free_agent | free agent]] or acting like the [[how_to_be_the_ceo_of_your_career | CEO of your career]] is particularly relevant in the current labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Changing Labor Market and Corporate Loyalty

The labor market has experienced a definitive softening in the last six to eight months, with many companies, especially in the tech industry, conducting layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This trend is expected to continue into other industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Companies often handle layoffs unprofessionally and without dignity or respect for their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Examples of Unprofessional Layoffs
*   **Google Employee:** A long-time Google employee, forced to return to the office with a long commute, discovered his layoff when his badge no longer worked to enter the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. There was no prior email or call from a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **During Business Trips:** Individuals have been notified of layoffs while in the middle of business trips, away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **During Labor:** One particularly distasteful story involves a person being laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **After Short Employment:** A person who left their previous company to join Google was laid off after only 13 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This highlights a lack of accountability for how these actions disrupt people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Companies view employees as "human resources" â€“ numbers on a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. They will eliminate positions without hesitation once an employee is no longer deemed useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### The Death of Corporate Loyalty
Corporate loyalty is a concept of the past, having died with the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The idea of working for 20-40 years at the same company for a pension no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Today, companies operate on an "instant gratification" model, with layoffs occurring as soon as things get tough, followed by hurried re-hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This creates a cycle of job hopping and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Why You Must Act Like a Free Agent

Given the current corporate landscape, nobody else will look out for your career interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish in your [[career_management_and_development | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. You owe your employer nothing more than an honest day's work for an honest day's pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Case Study in Free Agency
An individual, laid off unexpectedly in early November, demonstrated the power of acting like a [[career_management_and_being_a_free_agent | free agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Their resume and LinkedIn profile were promptly updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   They learned effective networking to bypass recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   This resulted in multiple job offers, including a $50,000 raise from their previous employment within five weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Even after accepting an offer and starting a new job, they continued with final interview rounds for another company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   This led to an even stronger offer, nearly $100,000 more than their original job that laid them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   Despite having worked at the new company for only two weeks, the advice given was to "act like a [[career_management_and_being_a_free_agent | free agent]] and take the better opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

This story highlights that you must always be thinking for yourself, as a new job could quickly lead to another layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Holding Companies Accountable

Employees can hold companies accountable by carefully choosing where they accept offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If a company has not behaved properly, giving them your service is akin to casting a vote in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. For example, Zillow laid off recruiting staff in late 2022 only to post the same jobs again shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, demonstrating a lack of accountability for destroying lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

As an experienced corporate recruiter, with over 20 years of experience, the speaker demystifies the [[behind_the_scenes_of_the_offer_process | offer process]] by revealing the inner workings of talent acquisition and human resources departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. After a long interview process, candidates often experience significant delays when waiting for a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Approval Process: Why Job Offers Take So Long

One of the primary [[reasons job offers are delayed | reasons job offers are delayed]] is the extensive approval process involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Post-Interview Debrief and Consensus

After all interviews are completed, the recruiter conducts a debrief meeting with all stakeholders who interviewed the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. During this meeting, each stakeholder provides a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" regarding moving forward with an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A near-unanimous consensus is typically required to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Compiling Offer Details

Once consensus is reached, the human resources (HR) or talent acquisition (TA) group begins compiling the offer details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This involves:
*   Reviewing the candidate's stated compensation expectation from the preliminary interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Analyzing local market wage surveys and industry wage data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Consulting internal salary bands, which typically include a minimum, mid-point, and maximum (or 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   For internal equity and to allow for future increases, most candidates in large companies are offered at or below the 50th percentile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Comparing compensation with internal comparatorsâ€”other employees in similar roles within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Handling Salary Discrepancies
> If a candidate's salary expectation is significantly higher than the average for the role, the company must strategically decide on the offer amount or find creative ways to make a compelling offer without stretching internal equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Recruiters often advocate for the candidate's sake to ensure the offer is likely to close the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. In some cases, if the salary expectation is too high, HR and the hiring manager may discuss "enriching the role" to justify the higher salary, which means greater expectations from the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Multi-Layered Approval Chain

After the offer details are determined, the proposed offer undergoes a multi-layered approval process, typically involving three or four layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:
1.  **Hiring Manager** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
2.  **Hiring Manager's Boss** (Hiring Manager Plus One) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
3.  **HR Business Partner** (separate from the talent acquisition group) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
4.  In some cases, the **Recruiting/Talent Acquisition Team** may have final approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Only after these approvals are secured will the recruiter create and present the formal offer letter, which can then lead to a [[evaluating_job_offers_and_negotiating_terms | negotiation process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This entire process, even if smooth, generally takes at least a week, if not more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Factors Causing Further Delays

Several other factors can significantly slow down the offer process:

*   **Unavailability of Approvers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>: If key approvers are on vacation or in lengthy business meetings, the process is stalled until they become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Senior Manager Misalignment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>: A senior manager might step in at the last minute to re-scope or scrutinize the role, halting an offer already in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Demand for a "Full Slate of Candidates"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>: Even if a strong candidate has been identified, some managers insist on interviewing a full slate of candidates, adding weeks to the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Recruiters often push back on this, as candidate engagement typically wanes after two to three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Process Bloat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>: Depending on the company, administrative or procedural steps, slow software systems, or additional checks and balances can introduce delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Internal Slowness/Overload** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>:
    *   The recruitment team or individual recruiter might be slow to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   The hiring manager may forget or delay approving the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   The HR team might be slow to provide information back to recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   Overloaded recruiters and hiring managers often have other responsibilities, causing this position to get buried in their priority list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Recruiter Frustration
> A long offer process is a significant frustration for most recruiters, as they want to fill positions quickly and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## How to Follow Up

If you are waiting on an offer that is taking a long time, it is advisable to politely nudge the hiring team, particularly the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Checking in every two or three days is acceptable, as recruiters generally appreciate the sense of urgency to get the offer approved and into your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The advent of [[ai_technology_in_photography | AI technology]] for creating professional headshots introduces a potential dilemma for headshot photographers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Previously, professional headshot photography was a "very lucrative" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, with the emergence of apps like Remini, which can generate "pretty convincing professional headshots" from uploaded selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, there's a question about how this might [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_job_market_changes | impact]] the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Instead of spending a fortune on professional headshots, individuals can now upgrade their [[ai_generated_linkedin_headshots | LinkedIn profile]] with [[ai_technology_in_photography | AI-generated]] images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While the ethical concern of "catfishing" exists if the [[ai_generated_linkedin_headshots | AI-generated photo]] doesn't accurately represent one's current appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, the tool can provide a "clean and professional looking headshot" if source photos are representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

This shift suggests a possible change in demand for traditional professional photography services, as individuals may opt for more affordable and accessible [[ai_technology_in_photography | AI-driven]] solutions for their professional profiles.

Congratulations on landing a job interview! To ensure you make the best impression, it's crucial to avoid certain [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | common interview mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As a corporate recruiter, experience shows there are specific pieces of information that, while seemingly innocent, are not in your best interest to reveal to a recruiter or hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Navigating an interview can feel like a minefield, where one wrong step could lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Too Many Personal Facts

Oversharing personal facts is a common [[impact_of_oversharing_personal_information_during_interviews | mistake]] for candidates who are either overly nervous or simply long-winded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Both of these traits can negatively impact how you're perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

*   **Professional Impact**: Employers often link your ability to articulate yourself in an interview to how you would perform in a business setting or meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Being long-winded can suggest a lack of emotional intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Conciseness**: Aim for interview answers that are generally two to three minutes in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Bias**: Revealing too much personal information can lead the interviewer to form biases, either for or against you, based on hobbies or personal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Keep your responses strictly related to the job at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Real Reason for Leaving Your Current Employer

While you shouldn't lie, carefully consider how you package your reasons for leaving your current job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **Negative Framing**: Avoid sharing negative experiences such as disliking a boss, feeling poorly treated, or being bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   Stating "my boss was terrible" can lead an employer to perceive you as difficult to work with, which is a significant [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   Claiming the job didn't challenge you might suggest to the employer that you lack initiative to find more enriching work yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Strategic Articulation**: Figure out the true reason you're leaving and articulate it in a way that doesn't appear threatening or problematic to a potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Your Long-Term Career Plans

When asked about your career plans, such as "where do you see yourself in five years?", interviewers are looking for commitment to the career path and potential for growth within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **Deal Breakers**: Revealing plans to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely after a few years is generally not viewed positively and can be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This indicates a lack of passion for the position you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Convey Passion**: It's essential to convey a level of passion for the work you're seeking to ensure the hiring manager feels good about your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Desperation for a Job

Even if you are desperate for a job due to being laid off or fired, revealing this urgency can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

*   **Perception**: Employers may perceive desperation negatively, much like in dating, pushing the desired outcome further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Composure**: Despite difficult personal circumstances, strive to convey calmness and collectedness to avoid being placed in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Your Age

While [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | age discrimination]] is illegal, it unfortunately still occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Avoid inadvertently revealing your age.

*   **Resume/Digital Footprint**: Be cautious with dates on your resume (e.g., graduation years) and elements of your email address that could indicate your age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. An outdated contact method like a fax number can also be a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] for age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Direct Disclosure**: Never offer your age during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Years Left in the Workforce

Candidates nearing retirement (e.g., in the last five to seven years of their career) sometimes reveal their intention to work only for a short period before retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Employer Bias**: This information can become a liability, as hiring managers often seek candidates with long-term commitment to the role or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Even if the average tenure is shorter, employers often seek candidates who envision 10+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Avoid Disclosure**: Do not disclose your retirement plans or how many years you intend to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Major Medical Issues or Disabilities

Unless a medical issue prohibits you from meeting the basic requirements of the position, it is generally best not to disclose it during the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

*   **Legal Protections**: Laws exist against discrimination based on pregnancy or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Candidates do not have to disclose these conditions if they can perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Reasonable Accommodation**: If you require a reasonable accommodation that would impact your ability to perform the job, or if you want the employer to know a dynamic that might affect your work (e.g., being high-functioning autistic), the appropriate time to bring this up is at the time of an offer, not during the interview itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Ability**: Employers should hire based on your ability to meet the job description's requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Revealing such information prematurely can inadvertently create bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Political Belief System

It can be tempting to share political beliefs, especially if you feel aligned with a company's mission or a hiring manager's viewpoints, but this is a significant [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid_in_interview_answers | mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

*   **Volatility**: The political spectrum is wide and often heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**: You never know the true belief system of the hiring manager, even if the company's stated values seem to align with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: It is best to stay completely out of political discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Previous Salary

When the salary question arises, typically during the recruiter phone screen, avoid disclosing your previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

*   **Risk of Undervaluation**: Disclosing your previous salary can lock you into a lower offer than you might otherwise receive, especially if you were previously underpaid compared to market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Determine Your Worth**: It's crucial for you, the candidate, to determine your worth based on market rates for your skills, experience, knowledge, and abilities, rather than allowing an employer to dictate your value based on past earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

By being mindful of these areas, you can navigate your job interviews more effectively and increase your chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

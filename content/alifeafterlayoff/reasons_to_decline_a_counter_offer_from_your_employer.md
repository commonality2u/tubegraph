Accepting a counter offer from a current employer after tendering a resignation often does not work out well for the employee in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While there are rare exceptions, most career coaches advise against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Why You Should Think Twice About Accepting a Counter Offer

### The "Proverbial Carrot" Trap
Employers often dangle promises of future plans, promotions, or increased responsibilities only after an employee submits their resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is a common tactic to keep employees from leaving, but these promises often come to fruition very slowly, if at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Underpayment and Being Taken for Granted
If your current employer offers a significant pay increase (e.g., 30%) only after you've accepted an offer elsewhere, it suggests you were likely underpaid or taken for granted previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. They didn't see your potential until you were about to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This often implies a lack of proactive recognition on their part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Financial and Career Risks
Accepting a counter offer can turn you into a "more expensive version of the same" employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This carries several [[potential_risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | potential risks]]:
*   **Target for Layoffs** If future layoffs occur, you might be among the first considered due to your higher cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Flight Risk Label** Your employer may view you as a "flight risk" who is disloyal, having explored external opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Increased Scrutiny** There will likely be a higher level of expectation and a "target on your back." Any future mistakes or underperformance may be scrutinized more critically, linked to your increased pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Lack of Concrete Career Advancement Plans
Promises of leadership roles or career progression, particularly at VP or C-suite levels, often lack concrete documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. A reputable company with genuine plans for your advancement would typically have:
*   **Written Plans** A detailed career plan in writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Succession Programs** You would already be part of a succession planning program, receiving development, mentoring, or even further education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Internal Promotions** Evidence that such senior roles are frequently filled internally, with peers already receiving similar opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Slow Progress** In many companies, especially smaller ones, significant career advancement to senior roles often only happens when someone retires or leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Employer's Past Behavior is Indicative of Future Behavior
The way your current company or boss has treated you and others in the past is the best indicator of how they will treat you in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. If they have a history of neglecting employee development or compensation until a resignation is tendered, it's likely that pattern will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Insincere Motivation
Counter offers can be insincere, often serving merely to buy the company time to find your replacement or to avoid immediate disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Their focus tends to be on "we can use you" rather than "we would like to help you grow your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

## Navigating the Conversation

When faced with a counter offer discussion:
*   **Maintain Control** You are in complete control of the conversation because you already have an acceptable offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Listen More Than You Speak** Hear out their scenario and what they are willing to offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Be Vague** Do not disclose details about your new opportunity, such as salary, company name, or specific job title. This prevents your current employer from potentially interfering with your new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut** If your gut tells you that leaving is the best course of action, it's usually a great indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Focus on the New Opportunity** Frame your departure as being "pulled by an opportunity" rather than "leaving due to an issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Honor Your Commitment** Stating that you want to honor your commitment to the accepted offer is a perfect and professional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Documentation is Key** If, for some reason, you were to consider a counter offer, demand everything in writing, including a new job title, responsibilities, job description, and salary, all documented in an official offer letter from HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Avoid Criticism** Do not use the meeting to air grievances about workload, distraction, or lack of challenge if you've already decided to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Always Be Professional** Even if you decline, do not burn bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Maintaining a good relationship can be beneficial for future networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Ultimately, you have to act as the CEO of your own career and look out for your best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

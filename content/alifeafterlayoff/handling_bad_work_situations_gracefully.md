When facing a difficult or [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]], or simply an unsatisfactory job situation, the best approach to leaving is with grace and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. This ensures you maintain a positive professional [[managing_workplace_relationships_for_career_growth | relationship]] and protect your employment brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

## Why Leave Gracefully?

Leaving a job in a spectacular or negative way, such as storming out or telling a boss off, is considered the wrong approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Such actions will only:
*   Make you ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   Burn bridges with the employer and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   Potentially lead former work friends to view you as a risk or "loose cannon," making them unlikely to provide future referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   Provide only momentary satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

It is always better to take the high road and be the professional in the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. How you treat people when you leave an organization will reflect on you and follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## Preparing to Leave

If you are unsatisfied with your job, boss, or a bad situation, it is recommended not to tell anyone until you are absolutely ready to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. It is better to leave on your own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, as it is easier to find a job when you are currently employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Secure Your Next Opportunity

Before giving notice, ensure you have your "ducks in a row" for your new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Completing drug screens and receiving results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   Finalizing background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   Confirming any references have been processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   Having a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

It's crucial to wait for these confirmations because offers can sometimes be rescinded due to background check issues, leaving you without either job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### Maintain Discretion

Keep your job search very discreet and professional, even from close work friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Rumors can spread and "bite you" if something changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. It's better to be in the driver's seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## How to Give Notice

### Inform Your Boss First

Once you have a confirmed start date for your new role, schedule a meeting with your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This meeting should ideally be face-to-face or via a Zoom call; avoid emails or text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

When informing your boss:
*   Keep it short and sweet, providing only the minimum necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   You can state you received another opportunity that is the best move for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   Thank them for their time and the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   Avoid elaborating on negative reasons for leaving, such as "you're a bad boss" or "I'm quitting because of this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This can create a volatile situation where emotions boil over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   Approach the conversation with "emotion zero point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>, as your decision should already be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   Give your two weeks' notice with courtesy and a high degree of professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Thank them for their time and the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### Two Weeks' Notice

Always give at least two weeks' notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This allows you to tie up loose ends and primarily benefits your colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Quitting on the spot burdens your coworkers, who will have to scramble to pick up your workload and support customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. It's considerate of the people who will have to pick up the pieces after you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Communicating with Others

After informing your boss, ask for their blessing on when to tell coworkers, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Follow proper protocol to leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

When speaking with colleagues and clients, acknowledge that your departure will create a void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Be gracious and appreciative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

On your last day, if possible, have a quick huddle with your team or call influential people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. Share a high-level, generic reason for leaving, such as a better opportunity that is better for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Avoid:
*   Focusing on negative aspects ("the company sucks," "my boss was terrible") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   Trashing people as you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

Instead, keep it positive, express gratitude for working with them, and highlight how it was a great time to grow your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Professional Relationships

*   **Personal Thank You:** Contact individuals who were instrumental in your career—those who trained you, provided guidance, or offered opportunities—and give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   **Networking:** Ask these individuals to join your personal network, especially on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Building strong networks is crucial for future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Keep Doors Open:** Always aim to leave on good terms and maintain good relationships with former bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. You may need them as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>, or they might call you back for future opportunities at their new company or the old organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. You can even ask your current boss if you would be considered to return if things don't work out at your new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

Leaving a great impression will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

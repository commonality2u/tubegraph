[[quiet_quitting_explained | Quiet quitting]] is a concept that gained significant traction in the workforce as an extension of the [[great_resignation_explained | Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. While some might view it as laziness, it is a deliberate decision made by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?

[[quiet_quitting_explained | Quiet quitting]] is defined as effectively quitting your job without actually quitting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This involves reducing output to the minimum acceptable standard required for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Employees do just enough to get by, avoid taking on additional tasks or burdens, and relieve themselves of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Why Employees Quiet Quit (The "Pros" from an Employee's Perspective)

Employees opt to [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quit]] for several reasons, often as a response to feeling exploited and to regain personal well-being:

*   **Re-evaluation of Work's Role** During the pandemic, many professionals began to view their jobs simply as a source of income to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. The shift is from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Response to Exploitation** After years of feeling exploited by employers through late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty, employees are "done letting companies squeeze free labor out of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This represents a "secret resistance against the status quo" of "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Market Conditions** A hot labor market provided job security, while the increase in remote work made it more difficult for managers to monitor effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Pendulum Shift** The power dynamic in the employment market has shifted significantly towards the employee, a change not seen since the 1930s with the Fair Labor Standards Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Companies that made "super deep cuts" during the 2020 pandemic layoffs found demand "screaming back," leading to burnout for remaining employees who had to pick up the slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Establishing Boundaries** Employees are no longer willing to be overloaded with work, work long hours, or work on weekends, finally establishing employment boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Generational Shift** The mentality of Generation Z, now entering the workforce, is "completely different" from previous generations, and they are less likely to be loyal to a single company for 20+ years, which has become "antiquated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Staying long-term can also lead to falling behind on compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Inability to Backfill** Employers may be unable to backfill positions if employees quit, making "some output...better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## Criticisms and Alternatives (The "Cons")

Despite the perceived benefits for employees, [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quitting]] is not without its criticisms:

*   **Perception of Laziness** Many Americans might label employees engaging in [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quitting]] as "lazy, unambitious, shiftless, and loafers who are unwilling to go the extra mile or even potentially burnouts who are unable to do so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **Speaker's Stance** The speaker explicitly states they are "not an advocate taking the quiet quit route" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Instead of [[quiet_quitting_explained | quiet quitting]], the speaker suggests a more proactive approach:

> It is recommended to treat yourself like a free agent and strategically plan your exit to upgrade your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. This involves keeping your resume up to date and re-evaluating your work situation if you're unhappy with treatment, compensation, or hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

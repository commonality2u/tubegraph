The current job market presents conflicting data, with claims of a robust market and record job openings alongside numerous major corporate layoffs, leading to a sense that "something doesn't seem to be adding up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This confusion is exacerbated by the rise of "ghost job postings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## What are Ghost Job Postings?
A "ghost posting" is a job advertisement that an employer has no real intention of ever filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These are a significant part of the [[issues_with_the_current_job_market_and_hiring_practices | current job market's issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The phenomenon has increased, adding to the challenges faced by job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Pipelining Requisitions (Wrecks)
A common form of ghost posting is a "pipelining wreck," which is posted solely to collect resumes for a future date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Employers use this strategy to build a candidate pool, theoretically gaining a head start when they decide to recruit again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This practice is considered "pretty shady" due to its optics, especially when a company has recently had massive layoffs but continues to post jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Leaders in talent acquisition have been known to suggest posting these "pipelining wrecks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This practice is seen as providing a very poor [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Job seekers invest time in creating targeted, custom resumes as part of their [[job_application_process_and_strategies | job application process and strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, expecting a genuine consideration for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Reasons for Ghost Postings

A survey conducted by Clarify Capital between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, questioned 1,045 managers involved in the hiring process about ghost jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Key findings include:
*   68% of managers had job postings active for more than 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   1 in 10 managers had a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. These are often "aging wrecks" that might indicate an overly particular [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]], a unique skill set, or a lack of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   1 in 5 managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   50% of managers keep job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, essentially "window shopping" for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

The most common reasons cited by employers for not actively trying to fill a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>:
*   **Always open to new people** (50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This is seen as deceitful, as it involves tricking employees into thinking relief is coming when it isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This practice is deceitful to both job candidates and investors and might have legal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Such a company is not desirable to work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **The job was filled, and they forgot to remove the posting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This is attributed to lazy recruiters or HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates/applicants in case of turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **In case an "irresistible candidate" applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data=t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This is considered lazy and irresponsible recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **To placate overworked employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This is deemed particularly sinister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **No particular reason; they simply don't care** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and Impact on Job Seekers
Many of these [[employer_selection_criteria_and_expectations | employer strategies]] are considered unethical. The practice of posting jobs with no intent to hire is often described as "shady" and "deceitful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Employers are criticized for losing sight of the [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, failing to put themselves in the job seeker's shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This behavior contributes to a "perfect storm" for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, who are already struggling to find employment amid conflicting job market data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It reflects a concerning trend in [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employer-employee relationship dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Ghost Postings
To avoid falling victim to a ghost posting, job seekers should:
*   **Check the posting date**: If a job has been up for over six months, or keeps getting reposted repeatedly, it's likely a ghost wreck or indicates a low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Conduct reverse reference checks**: Research if the company recently had major layoffs, especially in the same roles being advertised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If a company has shown disloyalty to a particular job type through layoffs, it's likely not a stable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Examine the job description**: A highly detailed job description with specifics about accomplishments and support indicates a more serious, legitimate requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Generic or "salesy" descriptions that lack specific role details are often red flags for pipelining wrecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Consider recency**: A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an active, legitimate recruiting effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

Focusing on high-quality roles with ethical employers is crucial to a successful job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

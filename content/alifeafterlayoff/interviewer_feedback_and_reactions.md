Based on available information, understanding interviewer feedback and reactions can be challenging, as direct indicators are not clearly detailed. One general statement notes that someone will be held "responsible for interviews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

While specific feedback mechanisms or clear [[signs_your_interview_went_well | signs an interview went well]] are not explicitly described, some phrases *could* be interpreted as very general, albeit unclear, reactions:
*   "The candidate is that is torn apart I love you just wild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>
*   "receiving your love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
*   "Say You're interested in geniuses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>
*   "You can see your house Your Best Wishes For You Together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>
*   "Something fun to the cynical segmentation fault of Future Past present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>

However, these mentions are highly ambiguous and do not provide concrete insights into typical interviewer feedback or specific reactions.

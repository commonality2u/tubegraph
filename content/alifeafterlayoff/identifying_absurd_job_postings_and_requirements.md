This article highlights various examples of absurd and [[common_red_flags_in_job_descriptions | ridiculous job requirements]] and [[identifying_lowquality_job_postings | low-quality job postings]] found online, aiming to help job seekers recognize when to value themselves and avoid applying for "garbage" opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Unacceptable Compensation and Demands

### Accounting Role with Poverty-Level Pay

A remote accounting job listing offered $1,400 per month, which breaks down to $8.75 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This position required two years of accounting experience with US-based businesses, a Bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field, and preferred experience in property management trust accounting and specific software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

At this pay rate, it is below minimum wage in some areas and would make it impossible to pay off student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For an entry-level accounting job, candidates should realistically expect to earn between $45,000 to $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Employee Handbook Charging Fees for Leaving

One restaurant's employee handbook outlined a series of charges against an employee's final pay if they left the organization before a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. These charges included:
*   Handbook fee ($10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   Training manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   File processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   Payroll processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   W-2 processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Uniform costs (e.g., $12 for a t-shirt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   Training costs ($25 per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   Hiring processing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>

This practice is unheard of in the industry and is indicative of an anti-employee stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Unpaid Work or "Test" Periods

Some employers ask candidates to perform actual work as part of the interview process without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. When a candidate questioned if they would be paid for a "test work day," the hiring manager responded with a passive-aggressive rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This highlights a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

#### Free Consultative Services

Companies may also require candidates to complete projects or case studies that address real business scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Job seekers should be reluctant to provide such work without compensation, as companies have been known to use these ideas without hiring the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. [[recognizing_red_flags_in_job_postings | No reputable company]] should demand free intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Unpaid "Startup" Role

A Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) position at a "chat memoir" startup required candidates to initially work on a part-time, unpaid basis until the company secured VC funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The role would then transition to a paid full-time position with potential for executive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

This is a significant [[red_flags_in_job_descriptions | red flag]], especially for a senior-level role, as it relies on an uncertain future funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Startups often lack proper business acumen, leadership experience, or HR processes, leading to absurd demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Unrealistic Expectations

### Overly Broad Salary Ranges

In states with pay transparency laws, some companies post an extremely wide salary range, such as $150,000 to $890,000 for a base salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This tactic is seen as an attempt to be shady and avoid true transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. It provides little useful information to job seekers and can indicate a deceptive approach by the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Combining Disparate Job Duties

A part-time position in Calgary, Canada, offered $20-$25 CAD per hour for a "website business developer" and "landscaper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. The role required redeveloping website advertising, promoting eco-friendly landscape services, and up to 50% physical labor for landscaping and snow removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. It also required the candidate to be registered with a Canadian post-secondary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. This combination of highly technical and manual labor duties is unrealistic for one role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Demanding Expert-Level Qualifications for Internships

A four-month student internship position required candidates to possess:
*   Advanced knowledge of insurance and wealth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>
*   Understanding of advisor compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>
*   Knowledge of internal administrative systems (proprietary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>
*   A post-secondary education in a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>
*   Professional designations such as CPA, CFA, or CSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>

The employer was expecting expert-level analytical skills (Power BI, Microsoft Excel, Tableau) for what is typically an entry-level learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Such demands are unrealistic for an internship and demonstrate employers' skewed expectations from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Bizarre Application Requirements

### Photo of Your Fridge

One job application included a requirement to attach a photo of the inside of the applicant's fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The criteria for what type of fridge condition is desired (messy vs. meticulously neat) was not specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. This is an example of a nonsensical and intrusive requirement that indicates an unprofessional or unserious employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

### Overly Detailed Application Questions

Some hiring managers try to embed extensive, behavioral-based interview questions directly into the job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. This is inefficient as applications should primarily be for expressing interest and providing basic qualifications for a recruiter to assess fit, with detailed questions reserved for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Such requirements can signal a cumbersome interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

These examples of [[fake_job_postings | absurd]] and [[scam_job_postings_warning_signs | predatory job postings]] are a disservice to job seekers. They are indicators of [[lowquality_job_postings | low-quality employers]] or those with [[common_red_flags_in_job_descriptions | unrealistic expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. Recognizing these [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags in job applications]] is crucial for job seekers to maintain self-respect and avoid investing time in roles that will not lead to career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. Often, these employers are doing job seekers a favor by clearly indicating their problematic nature upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Maintaining a high degree of [[professionalism_and_engagement_in_interviews | professionalism]] in the workplace is crucial for career stability and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. It requires extreme caution in what you disclose to co-workers, as inappropriate communication can lead to significant trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Drawing from a former HR perspective, here are key areas to be cautious about:

## Confidentiality and Personal Information

### Your Job Search
Avoid discussing an active job search with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Word spreads quickly, potentially reaching your boss, senior leaders, or HR, which could prematurely expedite your departure from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Additionally, be extra careful where you upload your resume online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If your resume lists your current employer, uploading it to public databases like Indeed or setting your LinkedIn profile to "available to work" could alert your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Your Salary
While salary transparency is generally beneficial for a level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, discussing your salary directly with co-workers within your company is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Such discussions can lead to colleagues feeling underpaid, causing them to quit or demand higher compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This can erode trust with your boss, potentially hindering your chances for promotion, regardless of legitimate reasons for pay differences (e.g., skill, experience, market changes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

If you wish to share salary information, do so anonymously on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind (for tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This allows others to gauge fair compensation without personal blowback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Maintaining Positive [[Workplace Relationships and Dynamics | Workplace Relationships]]

### Negative Comments About Your Boss or Co-workers
Refrain from making negative comments about your boss, even if you feel justified or confiding in a trusted "work ally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Such remarks frequently "come back to bite you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, as the boss always seems to find out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Similarly, avoid gossiping about other co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Having a reputation as a gossip can lead to complaints to management and unwanted attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Borrowing Money or Business Ventures
Never borrow money from or go into business with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This can create sticky situations that often end poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Asking for money can also make co-workers uncomfortable, potentially leading them to report it to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Professional Conduct

### Compliments on Physical Attributes
Avoid complimenting co-workers on their physical attributes, even if you intend it innocently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The perception of the compliment by the recipient is what matters, and it can easily make them uncomfortable, leading to HR complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Keep compliments professional, such as acknowledging a new hairstyle, and then move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Pregnancy Announcements
Never assume or ask if a co-worker is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. If they are pregnant, you might be forcing them to disclose it before they're ready. If they are not, you risk offending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Always let the individual take the lead on disclosing such personal news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Discussing Legal Issues
If you are involved in or planning litigation against your company, do not discuss it with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Sharing details about your case or grievances can allow the company to take proactive measures to defend themselves, potentially jeopardizing your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Keep such matters confidential and discuss them only with your attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Off-Color Jokes
Avoid telling off-color jokes in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Even if you consider a joke innocent, the recipient may interpret it offensively, leading to complaints to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Stick to "dumb dad jokes" or refrain from jokes altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Politics
Refrain from discussing political topics at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Political discussions are often "hot buttons" and can easily lead to arguments, causing offense regardless of your stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Such conversations rarely change minds and can lead to interpersonal conflicts or even legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure you treat your co-workers with a high degree of [[professionalism_and_engagement_in_interviews | professionalism]], avoid unnecessary drama, and protect your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

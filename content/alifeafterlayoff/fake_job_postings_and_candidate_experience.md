The current job market often feels challenging, with many job seekers not experiencing the "overabundance of positions" reported in labor reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. One significant reason for this difficulty is the prevalence of fake job postings, which negatively impact the [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Prevalence of Fake Job Postings

Many jobs posted online are not legitimate openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. As a corporate recruiter for over 20 years, the speaker has observed hiring managers publishing jobs with no intention of filling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The market feels more akin to 2020 post-pandemic, where hiring was difficult, and available jobs were often "low quality" contract positions that applicants might normally ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

A key indicator of market conditions is the recruiter market; when recruiters are laid off, it signals a lack of jobs to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. For example, Google specifically targeted recruiters in recent layoffs, which is considered a bad sign for the broader job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## [[employer_motivations_behind_fake_postings | Employer Motivations Behind Fake Postings]]

Companies and hiring managers engage in publishing fake job postings for several reasons, often stemming from "old school ways of approaching Talent acquisition" that do not prioritize the [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>:

*   **Building a candidate pipeline:** Some companies post jobs to "collect some applications" so they have a "slate of candidates" ready when they do decide to hire six to nine months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, candidates typically find other jobs and do not wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **"Fishing expeditions":** Hiring managers might post job requisitions simply "to see if there was somebody that maybe would land in their lap that was particularly strong," even if they are not actively looking to fill a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This means they are only looking for an "absolute perfect fit" and not necessarily to fill an existing need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Impact on [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | Candidate Experience]]

Fake job postings and flawed hiring processes lead to a frustrating and often demoralizing experience for job seekers:

*   **Unnecessary effort:** Candidates are forced to jump through "unnecessary Hoops" with only a "very, very slim chance" of even receiving a phone call back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Increased competition:** With increased layoffs over the past 18 months, competition for jobs has skyrocketed. A role that might typically receive 100 applications can now get 1,000, or even 2,000-3,000 applicants for a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This makes it "nearly impossible to stand out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Employers' pickiness:** High competition allows employers to be "abnormally picky" with their requirements and demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Job seekers applying for roles they are seemingly qualified for still face rejections without even a recruiter phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Indecisive hiring:** Employers are often indecisive, with hiring managers frequently changing their minds about candidate profiles or cancelling headcounts at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This can lead to job offers being rescinded due to "change of the market conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Cumbersome application processes:** Candidates face "convoluted and cumbersome" application processes, including uploading resumes only to manually re-enter information, taking multiple assessments, enduring six or seven rounds of interviews, preparing company projects, and sometimes even working for free <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Often, this culminates in being "ghosted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

The speaker notes that "most corporations hiring processes completely suck" and, despite significant investment in talent acquisition, major companies have not managed to improve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. While many recruiters genuinely care about the [[evaluating_the_candidate_experience_in_job_applications | candidate experience]], a few "bad apples" or indecisive hiring managers can undermine these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Combatting the Challenges

To navigate this difficult market, candidates must make their applications stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This includes:

*   Ensuring resumes are "airtight" and tailored to the jobs being applied for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Leveraging targeted networking to potentially bypass recruiters and connect directly with hiring processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Strategically using platforms like LinkedIn to get past recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Preparing thoroughly for interviews to take advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

By being consistent, open-minded, and adaptable, job seekers can still successfully find new job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

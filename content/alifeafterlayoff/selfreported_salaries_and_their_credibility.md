This article explores real-life self-reported salary data, primarily sourced from a Reddit thread, offering insights into various professions and their associated incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The information is presented by a corporate recruiter, who shares personal reactions and thoughts on the reported figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Credibility Disclaimer

It is important to note that the data originates from Reddit, which is described as the "wild wild west," meaning anyone can post information, and results should be taken "with a little bit of a grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Additionally, while efforts were made to eliminate non-North American entries for better comparison, there's no 100% guarantee that all self-reported salaries are from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, some salaries are confirmed to be accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

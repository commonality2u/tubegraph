When an employee receives a job offer from another company and informs their current employer, the employer may scramble to present a counter offer, promising things like a new job title or a larger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, accepting a counter offer comes with significant [[potential_risks_associated_with_accepting_a_counter_offer | potential risks]] and is generally not advised by experienced corporate recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## High Likelihood of Departure

Statistics indicate a high probability that employees who accept counter offers will still leave their company relatively soon after. According to LinkedIn, an overwhelming majority—80% or more—of people who accept counter offers will not be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This figure increases to 93% for those who won't be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Recruiters have observed this trend firsthand: candidates who accept a counter offer from their current employer often reach back out within a year, back on the market and looking for a new position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Underlying Issues Persist

One of the primary [[reasons_to_avoid_accepting_a_counter_offer | reasons to avoid accepting a counter offer]] is that the initial motivators for seeking new employment generally remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If the reasons for looking elsewhere included:
*   A bad boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Poor company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Work-life balance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
*   A difficult commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   Terrible benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

These problems are unlikely to resolve themselves simply because a counter offer was accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Even if a "honeymoon period" occurs where conditions seem to improve, it will eventually wear off, and the same issues will resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. If concerns about overall business stability motivated the job search, accepting a counter offer is unlikely to change that stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Employer's Motivation and Trust Issues

Employers typically make a counter offer because they were caught off guard and want to buy themselves time to find a replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This suggests that the company either undervalued or took advantage of the employee until they threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Damaged Relationships and Redundancy
Upon accepting a counter offer, relationships within the company are likely to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. By broadcasting an intention to leave, the employee has essentially made themselves redundant in the eyes of their employer, who will now focus on creating a contingency plan for their departure and potentially searching for a replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Increased Risk for Layoffs
Accepting a counter offer can label an employee as not long-term committed to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. When the company faces a rough patch, employees who have previously shown dissatisfaction, especially if they now have a higher salary, may be among the first considered for layoffs or other adverse employment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Stifled Career Progression
Even if a promotion or expanded responsibility is offered as part of the counter, [[impact_of_accepting_a_counter_offer_on_career_progression | long-term career prospects]] can be negatively affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Senior leaders may view the employee as less dedicated, passing them over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The promised role may merely be a temporary measure to keep the employee satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Even if promoted to a new role with a new boss, the employee will still have to work alongside the old boss—the person they effectively threatened to quit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Conclusion
Accepting a counter offer can be a stressful decision, but it's important to be selfish with one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Companies may lay off long-tenured employees with little warning, emphasizing the importance of looking out for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Leaving a bad boss, poor work culture, or a dying industry is not only the right thing to do but also the smart thing for one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

A recruiter shared a firsthand account of a candidate who turned around a moving truck mid-journey to accept a counter offer, only to call six months later admitting it was a big mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
When considering a counter offer, it's advised to think long and hard about whether it will truly help your career in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It's often compared to an old relationship: look back fondly, but remember it ended for a reason, and look forward to new beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

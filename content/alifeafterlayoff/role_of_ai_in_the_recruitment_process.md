The current labor market is experiencing significant shifts, making job searching more challenging than in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A major factor contributing to this difficulty is the rapidly evolving [[impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_employment | role of artificial intelligence in the job market changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Companies are actively exploring how [[impact_of_ai_on_job_security | AI will affect their workforce]] and considering replacing human workers with AI solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## AI's Influence on Hiring Decisions
Employers are taking a hard look at their workforce and considering whether roles previously open can be filled by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. An AI "robot" is seen as a more cost-effective solution that can operate 24 hours a day and potentially output three to five times more than a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This perspective is leading many employers to "pump the brakes" on hiring, making it harder to find jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Automation in Recruitment
Necessity has driven companies to automate more of their recruitment processes, especially after laying off many of their human [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. As a job seeker, you are increasingly dealing with AI during the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Impersonal Candidate Experience
The increased use of AI makes the application process more impersonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. AI systems operate in a "black and white" manner, leading to more rejections because there is no human interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This means if you don't precisely meet the AI's criteria, you are filtered out, which is not advantageous for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### AI in Interviewing
AI is even integrating into the interview process. Job seekers might find themselves interviewing with a robot for their first-round interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. There is also an increase in one-way video interviews, where candidates speak to a camera with no human on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. These recordings may then be assessed by an AI system looking for specific keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This further dehumanizes the process, as candidates cannot receive feedback from a human until potentially later stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### The Challenge for Career Changers
For individuals attempting to move into a new industry, job type, or changing careers, the reliance on AI presents a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. They typically need a human to give them a chance and offer an interpretation of their skills that might not be immediately obvious to an automated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers
The shift towards AI in recruitment contributes to a difficult labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Job seekers are applying to 40% more jobs compared to a year ago, yet are facing fewer opportunities and more rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This environment emphasizes the need for job seekers to develop strong application and interviewing skills to stand out against increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Top Questions to Ask Your Hiring Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>

Here are 10 [[essential_questions_to_ask_during_an_interview | questions to ask]] to gain critical insights and ensure a good fit:

1.  **"Why is this position open?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>
    *   This question provides insight into the department's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>.
    *   If the previous person was terminated, laid off, or quit, it cues you to prod further to understand the underlying reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
    *   If it's a new headcount, it signals department or company growth, which is generally a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

2.  **"What is your vision for this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>
    *   Understanding the hiring manager's long-term vision helps you cater your answers throughout the [[job_interview_experiences | interview]] to align with their needs and reasons for creating the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

3.  **"What's one weakness that you currently have in your department?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>
    *   This flips the script and allows you to understand where your skills might fit in, especially if you also ask about departmental strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. (A previous video discusses [[how_to_respond_to_tricky_interview_questions | how to answer this question]] when asked of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>).

4.  **"How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>
    *   This takes the previous question a step further, helping you determine if your capabilities align with their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

5.  **"How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
    *   This is critical to ensure that expectations are reasonable and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
    *   If the hiring manager's expectations seem unrealistic, it's an opportunity to push back and ask further questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Unreasonable expectations can lead to failure and quick turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

    > [!WARNING] Red Flag Employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>
    > This question can help determine if you're dealing with a "red flag employer" if their expectations are out of sync with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

6.  **"What is it about the previous person that made them so successful in this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>
    *   If the previous person was promoted or moved on, this question provides a roadmap for your own success in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

7.  **"Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>
    *   While you should show enthusiasm for the current role, it's reasonable to inquire about long-term career paths to avoid a dead-end position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

8.  **"What would you describe your leadership style as?"** (or "If I was to go out into your department and ask some of your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>
    *   Vetting your potential boss's leadership style is crucial for determining if you'll align well and if it's a long-term fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

    *   This strategic question helps determine the organization's direction and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
    *   A reputable company will be aware of competitors and have a strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. If they don't, it's a red flag warranting more questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

10. **"If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>
    *   This "fun" question encourages strategic thinking and provides deep insight into the true behind-the-scenes concerns of the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

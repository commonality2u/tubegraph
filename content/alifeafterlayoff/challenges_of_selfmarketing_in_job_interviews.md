Even if a candidate is the "best person on paper," it doesn't automatically guarantee they will be hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. It can be particularly baffling to be overlooked for a job you felt confident about, especially when the hired candidate's background seems less qualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This happens because the hiring process isn't just about qualifications; it's about who [[strategies_for_demonstrating_competence_and_motivation_during_interviews | sells themselves most effectively]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## Interviewing as Marketing
Interviewing is essentially a marketing exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Candidates must market their skills and convince the interviewer that they are the best fit for the role through salesmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. The challenge arises when candidates believe their excellence should be self-evident, feeling they shouldn't have to explicitly state they are the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Presentation
The brutal truth is that [[interview_skills_and_selfpresentation | how you present yourself]] in an interview is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. If a candidate is not adept at marketing themselves, their superior qualifications "on paper" may not matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Equipping oneself with the necessary tools for effective self-presentation is crucial to secure job offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[improving_job_interview_performance | improving job interview performance]] and [[preparing_for_job_interviews | preparing for job interviews]] with a focus on [[strategies_for_successful_job_interview_responses | successful job interview responses]].

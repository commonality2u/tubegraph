This article explores the personal journey of an individual who experienced significant [[Career stagnation and regret | career stagnation]] and offers insights into how to avoid similar pitfalls by taking ownership of one's career progression. The speaker shares his own story as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of acting like the "CEO of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Early Career and Unfulfilled Promises

Early in his career, the speaker was recruited into a relatively small company in the railroad services industry, which had about 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His official title was Staffing and Development Manager, a role that largely focused on recruiting and employee relations, effectively turning into a Human Resources Manager position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The work was "meaty" and provided great experience, allowing him to impact the business and see people grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The primary reason for accepting the role was a clear promise: he was supposed to learn from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was slated to retire in 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The expectation was that he would be promoted into the VP role after this period, running HR for the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The boss was described as particular with an "old school" approach to HR, but also possessed a high degree of empathy for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The company fostered a "family-oriented atmosphere," with supportive owners and a laid-back work environment that offered a high degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The Reality of Prolonged Stagnation

Despite the initial promise, the speaker's boss, along with other senior leaders across different divisions, delayed their retirements significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. After 18 months, it became evident that his boss had no intention of retiring, as he had established a "little kingdom" with considerable influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. These leaders were reluctant to let go, partly due to the "really nice bonuses" they received annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The speaker continued to "bide his time," believing he would eventually get the promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. He was part of a leadership development group, designed to groom future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, members of this group, his peers, began to leave the organization one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For example, one peer became president of a competitor company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Ultimately, only about one out of eight or ten people from that succession group achieved the expected level in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The senior leaders often told their potential successors they were "not ready yet," despite not providing adequate development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### The Apathy of Comfort

The speaker, unlike his astute peers, remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He had a steady job, was well-regarded, and had a supportive boss (in terms of being family-oriented) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He felt no high degree of pressure and figured his boss would eventually retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. What was supposed to be 18 months turned into nine years total at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

This period led to profound [[Career dissatisfaction and job burnout | career dissatisfaction]] and [[impacts_of_being_too_comfortable_in_one_job | impacts of being too comfortable in one job]]. The speaker became very apathetic and comfortable, "just collecting a steady paycheck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. He admits he was not acting like the [[Career advancement and company loyalty | CEO of his career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. By staying too long, he "became Joe" as described in his video on [[why_a_steady_job_can_be_bad_for_your_career | why a steady job can be bad for your career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The speaker realized he should have taken cues from his peers who left, but instead he "let the work come to [him]" and waited for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This resulted in him falling "further back in [his] career" compared to his peer group, who were advancing to director levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Constantly being told "you're not ready" made him start to believe it, when in reality, it was often due to the insecurities of the existing managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

He lost passion for the human resources role, going into "autopilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. He stopped caring about going "above and beyond" or being considered for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Being too comfortable led to a cessation of active career decisions, focusing only on the steady paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This also meant he stopped trying to learn, keep up with industry trends, or new technologies, causing him to fall behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. When he eventually re-entered the job market, he found himself behind his peer group in terms of skills, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## The Shift and the Aftermath

Around seven years into his tenure, another senior leader noticed his lack of enthusiasm and recognized his talent in marketing, photography, and creative areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This led to a transition out of HR into a different part of the organization for his final two years there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. His old boss eventually hired a replacement two years after the speaker left HR, but still "hovered" over the new person for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It took his boss nine years to retire, instead of the promised 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Looking back, the speaker doesn't regret working for the company but deeply regrets [[Dealing with unfulfilled career promises | how he handled his career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He describes his approach as "playing checkers" instead of "chess" with his career, lacking a plan or strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

When he left the organization, he had to take a step downward in responsibility to gain the specific recruiting experience he desired, rebranding himself to focus on that component of HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This occurred while his peers were moving into senior director roles, setting him back by "probably a decade" in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. He also discovered he was significantly behind the market in terms of [[Wage stagnation and career progression in the job market | compensation]], costing him "thousands and thousands of dollars in lost income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Advice

The moral of the story is the critical importance of taking your career seriously and learning how to "play chess" with it, acting as the CEO of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This means taking ownership and not letting opportunities simply come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

For those who are stuck, not satisfied, or frustrated with their career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>:
*   **Act like the CEO of your career**: Don't spend too much time waiting for recognition from an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Avoid being "too good at your job" in one role**: If a company keeps you stuck because they can't lose you in that position, you need to take control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Continuously test the open market**: A true "free agent" and CEO of their career should consistently entertain other opportunities to stay available for the best options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Develop a clear plan and strategy**: Don't just "play checkers" with your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Stay current with skills and industry trends**: Actively seek to learn and grow, rather than falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that career runway shortens quickly, and being apathetic or passively waiting for things to happen wastes valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

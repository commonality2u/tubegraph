When you are actively looking for a new job while still employed, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution with what you disclose to co-workers and where you post your resume. Maintaining discretion can prevent your current employer from discovering your [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search]] efforts, which could expedite your exit from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Confidentiality in Your Job Search

> The first thing you want to avoid saying to your co-worker is if you're in an [[effective_job_search_strategies | active job search]] and you start telling them that you're in an [[effective_job_search_strategies | active job search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Information about your [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search]] can quickly spread through workplace whispers and gossip, potentially reaching your boss, senior leaders, or the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This can lead to undesirable consequences, including an early departure from your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Managing Your Resume and Online Presence

If you do not want your current employer to know you are looking for a new job, be particularly careful about where you place your [[updating_resumes_and_job_searching_strategies | resume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Avoid uploading your [[updating_resumes_and_job_searching_strategies | resume]] to public databases like Indeed if it lists your current company or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Similarly, refrain from uploading your [[updating_resumes_and_job_searching_strategies | resume]] to your current LinkedIn profile and setting your status as "available to work," as this can alert your employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

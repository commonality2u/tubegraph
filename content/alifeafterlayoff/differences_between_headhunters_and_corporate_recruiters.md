There are two primary types of recruiters involved in the hiring process: headhunters and corporate recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. Understanding their distinctions is crucial for job seekers to navigate interviews effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

## Headhunters

Headhunters are third-party recruiters who are contracted by companies to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   **Compensation:** They operate on a contingency basis, meaning they are paid only upon successful placement of a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. This payment is typically a portion of the placed candidate's first year's salary, usually ranging from 15% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **Role Knowledge:** Headhunters generally do not possess the same depth of knowledge about a specific role as an internal corporate recruiter would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Corporate Recruiters

Corporate recruiters, also known as internal recruiters, are full-time employees of the company they are hiring for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>. The speaker, with over 20 years of experience, is a corporate recruiter who has hired thousands of people for well-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Organizational Structure:** They typically work within a Talent Acquisition department, which might be under the HR umbrella or a standalone department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   **Compensation:** Corporate recruiters are paid a salary, not on a contingency basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>.
*   **Primary Goal:** Their main objective is to find the best possible fit for their hiring manager, as this is the metric by which they are evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>.
*   **Specialization and Relationships:** They often support specific functional groups and work repeatedly with the same hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. This fosters strong relationships and allows them to have good alignment on position requirements and hiring manager expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.
*   **Interview Focus:** The first interview with a corporate recruiter is usually a screening interview to assess baseline competencies for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>.

The Human Resources (HR) department is widely known for its intense focus on documentation, often earning it a controversial reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This obsession with documenting every aspect of an employee's journey is not arbitrary; it serves a specific, foundational purpose for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Pervasive Documentation
[[Human Resources Myths and Reality | HR]] departments are "utterly obsessed" with documenting every single event in the employment arrangement, particularly securing an employee's signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This process begins the moment an individual interacts with the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:45">[01:56:45]</a> and continues through various stages of employment:

*   **Application Process** The employment journey starts with an application that includes disclaimers and legal language requiring the applicant's signature to confirm understanding and truthfulness of information provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Offer Letter** Similarly, the offer letter contains terms and conditions with extensive legal wording, all requiring a signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Background Checks** Consent for background checks also requires a signature, continuing the documentation trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Orientation and Training** During orientation, new employees go through training courses and policy reviews, signing off on a multitude of documents and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Employee Handbook** The employee handbook typically includes a section for the employee's signature, acknowledging receipt and understanding of its contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Performance Appraisals** Performance appraisals also require an employee's signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Coaching Sessions** Any "documented" coaching sessions will also require a signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Exit Process** Even upon exiting the company, employees are asked to sign additional documents, especially those pertaining to severance packages, which come with their own terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## The Underlying Motivation: Limiting Liability
The fundamental reason behind [[Human Resources Myths and Reality | HR's]] extensive documentation, particularly collecting signatures, is to "limit their liability and potentially build a case against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These collected documents are stored in an employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Should the need arise in the future, the company can reference these documents to defend its decisions against an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Therefore, employees should always remember that the [[Human Resources Myths and Reality | HR]] department's primary function is to limit the company's liability first and foremost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Employment ghosting is a common and frustrating experience for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Even experienced professionals, including the speaker, have been ghosted, and it "sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## What is Employment Ghosting?

The speaker defines employment ghosting as occurring when an employer or company representative moves a candidate into a formalized interviewing process and then fails to follow up on the application's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>. It is not considered ghosting if a candidate applies to a role and does not receive a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## The Experience of Being Ghosted

The typical scenario involves applying for a job, getting contacted by a recruiter, becoming excited about the opportunity, and then moving through multiple interview rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. After being told, "we'll get back to you shortly," candidates enter a waiting game that can last weeks or even months, leading to the realization that they have likely been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This phenomenon is considered poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Why Ghosting Happens (Briefly)

While the full [[Reasons why employers ghost candidates | reasons why employers ghost candidates]] are complex, common factors contributing to ghosting include:
*   Lazy recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>
*   Bad work processes within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>
*   Overloaded recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>
*   Recruiters simply forgetting to follow up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>
*   Hiring manager indecisiveness or delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>
*   Positions being placed on hold or re-scoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>
*   Another candidate being hired without formal closure for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>

## What to Do If You Suspect You've Been Ghosted

Unfortunately, there isn't "a whole lot" a candidate can do once they suspect they've been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:57">[09:51:57]</a>.

The primary recommended action is to:
*   **Send a nudge to the recruiter** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. A quick follow-up message can prompt the recruiter to check the application status and provide an update or properly close out the candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:15">[10:00:15]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> The speaker does not advocate for ghosting, stating it's "the worst kind of [[Impact of poor candidate experience | candidate experience]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

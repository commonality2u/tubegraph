The concept of [[employer_reactions_and_quiet_firing | quiet firing]] describes a situation where an employer attempts to make an employee's work environment so difficult that they are compelled to leave voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tactic, also known in Human Resources as "constructive dismissal," aims to push an employee out without directly [[implications_of_getting_fired | terminating]] them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## What is Constructive Dismissal?

Constructive dismissal occurs when a company makes an employee's work or employment situation so unbearable that the individual feels they have no option but to [[steps_to_quitting_a_job_properly | quit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Reasons Companies Use Constructive Dismissal
Companies may resort to constructive dismissal for several reasons:
*   **Avoiding issues after termination** If an employer perceives an employee as a potential problem, direct termination could lead to additional complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Avoiding benefit payouts** By prompting an employee to leave voluntarily, companies can avoid financial obligations such as unemployment insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[signs_of_quiet_firing_in_the_workplace | Signs of Quiet Firing]]

It is important for employees to recognize [[signs_of_potential_termination_at_work | signs]] that their employer may be attempting to "quiet fire" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While one or two of these signs might not be conclusive, a combination of several suggests a need for heightened awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Here are some common indicators:

*   **No Raises in Several Years** If an employee has not received a raise for an extended period, especially when colleagues in the same department or company have, it may indicate a lack of valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Repeatedly Passed Up for Promotion** Despite expressing interest and actively positioning themselves for advancement, an employee may be continually overlooked for promotions, even when less deserving individuals are chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This often involves behind-the-scenes discussions within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Denied PTO or Vacation Requests** Assuming requests are reasonable, properly coordinated for coverage, and not excessive, repeated denials of paid time off can be a tactic to make an employee's life uncomfortable and signal they are not valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Placement on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** Being placed on a PIP or similar performance management tool often signifies that the company is preparing to manage the employee out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. While some managers genuinely hope for improvement, a PIP with unreasonable or unrealistic expectations is typically a precursor to dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Sudden Changes to Work Schedule** This can include mandatory overtime, especially during times known to be burdensome for the employee, or, conversely, a drastic reduction in hours to the bare minimum, potentially impacting benefits eligibility and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Increased Workload** An employer might intentionally assign an unbearable amount of work, forcing unreasonable hours without additional pay, to motivate the employee to seek other employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Lackluster Performance Appraisals** A sudden shift from positive to overly critical performance appraisals, particularly when previous reviews were complimentary, can be a sign. HR departments often use performance appraisals for formal documentation, and a negative review can be a demotivating factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Boss Disengagement** A significant warning sign is when a supervisor stops communicating effectively, such as missing one-on-one meetings, rescheduling at the last minute, not prioritizing the employee, or failing to respond to emails and provide necessary information or support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Removal from Projects or Meetings** Being suddenly excluded from projects previously led, uninvited to staff meetings, or no longer privy to informal workplace discussions can indicate being marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Public shunning by the boss can also occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Options for Employees

If an employee suspects they are being constructively dismissed, they have several options:

*   **Force the Company's Hand** Continue performing duties as usual, effectively forcing the company to formally terminate employment if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Seek New Employment** Act like a "free agent" and proactively seek a new job in a more supportive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Remaining in a toxic work environment can negatively impact personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Consult an Attorney** If there is a belief that the constructive dismissal is rooted in discrimination, it is advisable to consult a local attorney to understand relevant laws and potential legal recourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

It is always a best practice to keep one's resume updated and ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Resources such as courses on resume writing or private coaching sessions can assist in this preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

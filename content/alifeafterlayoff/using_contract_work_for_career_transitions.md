When facing a challenging job search, many individuals consider whether to pursue contract work as an alternative to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there is a common stigma that contract positions are "lower quality" or merely temporary, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience suggests a strategic view of these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. From both a recruiter and [[career_coaching_and_job_transitions | career coach]] perspective, contract roles can be a valuable tool in [[career_advice_for_transitioning_to_new_job_opportunities | career transitions]] and a difficult job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[contract_work_vs_fulltime_employment | Pros of contract work]] for Transitioning

### More Readily Available Opportunities
In uncertain economic times, such as during a pandemic, companies often need work completed but are hesitant to add permanent headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This leads to a higher prevalence of contract positions, making them more accessible than full-time roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. A job seeker therefore has a greater likelihood of being considered for a contract role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Demonstrating Skills and Reducing Employer Risk
Contract positions offer a low-risk opportunity for employers to assess a candidate's abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If a hiring manager is apprehensive about a candidate or if the role requires a niche skill set, a contract can allow the individual to prove their capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Many contract roles, though not all, may lead to a full-time conversion if the individual performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It is advisable to ask during an interview if there's a likelihood of conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Pivoting Careers and Gaining New Skills
Contract work can be a strategic pathway to [[career_coaching_and_job_transitions | pivot into a new industry]], a new job type, or to gain a new skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For example, if you are looking to enter a dominant industry in your area but lack direct experience, a contract position can provide the necessary exposure to "pivot your resume" and gain experience in that new field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This is a very strategic way to fill skill or experience gaps on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Continuing Income While Searching
A contract position allows you to maintain an income stream while continuing your search for a desired full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Given that a typical job search can last six to nine months, or even up to a year in some markets, securing a contract role can "bridge the gap" financially and buy more time for a thorough search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### "Test Drive" the Company and Role
Just as a company can test drive a candidate, a contract position allows the individual to "test drive" the company, work environment, team, and type of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If the environment or role is not a good fit, it's easier to move on compared to a permanent full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Boosting Confidence Post-Layoff
For those who have experienced a layoff or an adverse employment decision, a contract position can help [[strategizing_career_moves_after_job_loss | boost confidence]], get back into the workforce, and re-establish a routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Finding a full-time job is often easier when there is already a steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Potentially Higher Hourly Pay
In many cases, contract positions can offer a higher hourly rate compared to a full-time equivalent, even allowing some contractors to take extended breaks between contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. However, this often comes without the benefits package of a full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## [[cons_of_contract_work | Cons of Contract Work]]

### "Hopping Resume" Perception
A significant drawback of taking too many contract positions, especially early in a career, is the potential for a "hopping resume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Many hiring managers view a history of short-term roles negatively, perceiving a lack of commitment to long-term projects, process improvement, or building lasting relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Lack of Benefits
In most cases, contract positions do not come with benefits packages, which are typically much more robust for full-time employees of large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While some agencies may offer benefits, they are generally less comprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This is a key [[financial_considerations_in_contract_vs_fulltime_work | financial consideration]].

### Sense of Limbo and Lack of Employer Commitment
Working on a contract can create a sense of limbo, especially if one is accustomed to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. There's an ongoing need to plan for what's next after the contract ends, and major life events requiring stable income (e.g., buying a house, having children) can feel put on pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Furthermore, there's a recognition that the employer is not fully committed to the contractor, often with no clear career opportunities or long-term loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Not Feeling Part of the Team
Contract employees may experience a feeling of not truly belonging to the team, knowing their tenure is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Discussions about future projects or long-term plans can feel detached, as the contractor knows they may not be there to see them through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Conclusion
The decision between contract and full-time work requires weighing these [[pros_of_contract_work | pros]] and [[cons_of_contract_work | cons]], considering personal preferences, the current job market, and how frequently job offers are being received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. For many, contract work can be a sensible and strategic choice, especially during a difficult job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

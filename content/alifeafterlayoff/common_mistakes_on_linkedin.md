Having an active and well-maintained LinkedIn profile is crucial for career development and job seeking. A corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience, who has hired thousands of people for well-known companies, emphasizes that recruiters use LinkedIn extensively to find the best candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25"></a>. They often find it more effective than open job postings, which can be "untargeted" and yield many unsuitable applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>. Recruiters prefer LinkedIn because it allows them to narrow down searches and find ideal matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a>.

If you don't already have a LinkedIn profile, creating one is the first step, as you may be missing out on significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>. This article outlines six common [[Common mistakes in the hiring process|mistakes job seekers make on LinkedIn]] that can limit their opportunities, as identified by recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17"></a>.

## 1. Not Allowing Contact

One of the most frustrating [[Common Interview Mistakes|mistakes]] for recruiters is finding a perfect candidate but being unable to contact them due to restricted privacy settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37"></a>. LinkedIn has a "Recruiter" platform (a back-channel site) that allows recruiters to search the database using keywords and advanced Boolean searches to find specific skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38"></a>. If a candidate blocks connections from unknown users, recruiters cannot reach out, even for ideal opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45"></a>.

It is strongly recommended to keep your contact options open, especially if you are an active job seeker or wish to receive career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17"></a>. Even for "passive candidates" (those not actively seeking a job), allowing contact is worthwhile, as it only takes a few seconds to review emails, and you might discover a life-changing opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52"></a>. Receiving emails from recruiters indicates that your profile is in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16"></a>.

## 2. Missing Keywords

Recruiters use advanced search strategies, such as Boolean searching, with strings of keywords to find very specific profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45"></a>. If your LinkedIn profile lacks the specific keywords recruiters are looking for, it will not appear in their search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54"></a>.

It is crucial to load your LinkedIn profile with all relevant keywords a recruiter might search for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06"></a>. To determine which keywords to add, keep abreast of your industry's common skills and terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18"></a>. The more keywords you include, the easier it will be for recruiters to find and contact you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31"></a>.

## 3. Not Being Active

Having a great profile with keywords and open contact settings is ineffective if you don't regularly check your LinkedIn messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39"></a>. To avoid [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid|missing out]], it's essential to:
*   Keep a pulse on what's happening on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53"></a>.
*   Check your emails occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57"></a>.
*   Set up notifications for direct messages to an email address you frequently check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59"></a>. You can adjust LinkedIn settings to receive only InMail notifications and avoid excessive alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10"></a>.

Being active allows you to see job opportunities reposted by connections and those popping up in your feed from your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44"></a>. For white-collar professions, LinkedIn is an excellent way to network, see industry trends, and maintain a professional presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21"></a>.

## 4. Not Networking

Many LinkedIn users have fewer than 100 connections, which can make them appear inactive or as if they lack a robust network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47"></a>. LinkedIn allows for a vast number of connections (up to 35,000-50,000), so there is no reason not to expand your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08"></a>. More connections mean greater visibility and more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18"></a>.

To build your network:
*   Connect with previous employers, colleagues, and bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29"></a>.
*   Expand to broader circles, including people from your local industry, similar roles, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41"></a>.
*   Aim for at least 500+ connections on your profile, as this shows recruiters you are active and invested in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27"></a>.

## 5. Being a Lurker

Simply having a large network isn't enough; you must also engage with it. If you never interact with posts or create your own content, your name and brand won't gain visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44"></a>. Engagement is key to building your professional brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14"></a>.

By leaving thoughtful comments, creating good content that sparks discussion, and actively participating, you build your employment brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18"></a>. Recruiters, who are on LinkedIn daily, notice active users whose names frequently appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47"></a>. Even starting small, such as engaging on one post a day or putting out one to three posts a week, can yield surprising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13"></a>.

## 6. Engaging in Controversial Discussions

A critical [[Common mistakes to avoid when introducing yourself|mistake]] to avoid is engaging in controversial discussions, especially concerning politics, religion, or other non-work-related belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37"></a>. Such arguments are visible to your entire network and beyond, potentially reaching hundreds of thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16"></a>.

Associating your professional brand with contentious dialogue can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37"></a>. While having independent opinions is fine, LinkedIn is not the appropriate platform to air them publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50"></a>. Recruiters may judge your professionalism based on your online conduct, even if they agree with your stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15"></a>. Always keep your interactions work-related, professional, and "above the cuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05"></a>.

By avoiding these common pitfalls, job seekers can significantly enhance their presence and opportunities on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32"></a>.

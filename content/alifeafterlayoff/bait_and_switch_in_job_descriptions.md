[[Fake job postings and hiring practices | Poor quality employers]] often employ a [[bait_and_switch_salary_tactics | bait and switch]] tactic where the job advertised does not match the actual position offered or discussed during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:59">[03:14:59]</a>. This is considered a major [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] in the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:09">[03:42:09]</a>.

## Identifying the Bait and Switch

The [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | bait and switch]] scenario typically unfolds as follows:
*   **Initial Appeal** A candidate applies for a position after reading a job description that seems like a great fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>.
*   **Shifting Role** During the interview, the job described by the hiring manager "seems to have shifted to something completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>. This new role might be "completely unrelated to what the job title is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.
*   **Misleading Promises** The employer might [[misleading_promises_by_employers | promise]] that if you work in the initially described, different role for "six months or nine months," you will then be shifted into the job you originally applied for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:16">[03:37:16]</a>. However, the chances of this actually happening are "very slim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:59">[03:44:59]</a>.
*   **Hiding Undesirable Aspects** [[Employer strategies behind fake job listings | Low quality employers]] use this tactic to "get people in the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:06">[03:50:06]</a>. They tend to "hide the undesirable aspects of the job" or "sugar coat them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:40">[04:02:40]</a>.

## Consequences for the Candidate

If there is an "obvious disconnect" between the hiring manager's expectations and the external job advertisement, accepting the position will likely lead to "a lot more problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>. These positions are often "bad job[s]" that candidates should avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:44">[04:08:44]</a>. This practice is a form of [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory hiring practice]] that aims to draw candidates into undesirable roles.

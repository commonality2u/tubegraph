[[high_turnover_rates_and_their_red_flags | High turnover rates]] are a definitive indicator that something is amiss within a workplace, often signalling a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While some employee churn is natural and even healthy for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, an abnormally [[high_turnover_rates_and_their_red_flags | high turnover rate]], either across the company or specifically within a department, points to significant issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Voluntary Turnover

Focusing on voluntary turnover – instances where employees choose to leave rather than being terminated – is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Generally, people do not leave well-regarded companies unless they have exhausted opportunities for growth within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. In healthy companies, employees might seek roles in different departments or work with the company to develop career growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The best companies typically boast significantly lower [[high_turnover_rates_and_their_red_flags | turnover rates]] than the industry standard of 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

If you observe a "revolving door" of employees from the moment you join an organization, it is a significant warning sign that demands close attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This should prompt investigation during the job application process.

### Investigating Voluntary Turnover

When considering a new job or assessing your current environment, investigate the reasons behind employee departures:
*   **Ask during interviews** When in a job interview, always ask "Why is this position open?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This question helps vet [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | job opportunities]] thoroughly before committing to a new organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Consult review sites** Check company reviews on platforms like Glassdoor and Indeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Look for common themes or threads regarding why people are leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Listen and observe** Keep your ears open and observe dynamics within departments you might be exposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Informal conversations can provide insights into turnover reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Understand review bias** Be aware that people often leave reviews when they are unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. However, look for recurring issues such as leadership behavior, realistic expectations, competitive benefits, compensation, respect for employees, and [[work_life_balance | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Beware of fabricated reviews** Some unscrupulous companies have been known to incentivize employees to post false positive reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. If you notice a suspicious clump of positive reviews, take them with a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The act of fabricating reviews itself is a sign of a toxic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Good companies actively focus on exit interviews to gather data and identify trends related to employee departures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Involuntary Turnover

Excessive involuntary turnover, where employees are terminated or "let go" by the company, is another significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. If an organization has a reputation for:
*   Terminating individuals for minor infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Firing employees for failing to meet difficult-to-achieve metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Exhibiting knee-jerk reactions to market conditions by laying people off with the expectation of recalling them later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

These practices demonstrate an inept management team or a lack of care for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. An unstable work environment, often characterized by bosses who fire on a whim or based on unreasonable standards, is considered toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

If you encounter such signs, it's essential to develop an exit strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Prioritize your well-being and career, as you are a "free agent" responsible for looking out for yourself first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

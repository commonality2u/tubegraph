The current job market is significantly different from previous years, presenting new [[challenges_of_the_current_job_market | challenges]] for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. It is generally not considered a good time to quit a job unless absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Many individuals who have quit their positions are finding it extremely difficult and time-consuming to secure new employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Even marketable professionals with strong backgrounds are struggling to get phone calls or first-round interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Increased Competition

The job market is currently extremely competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Companies often receive thousands of applicants for a single job opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This competition is particularly high for highly coveted roles, such as remote and hybrid positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It has become increasingly rare for companies to be "remote-first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, leading to an intense "feeding frenzy" when such opportunities are posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Shift from the "Heyday" of 2021-2022

The job market has undergone a significant transformation since 2021 and most of 2022, which were considered a "Heyday for job seekers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. During that period, companies were actively throwing money at talent due to difficulties in hiring people fast enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Impact on the Tech Industry

A notable example of this shift is seen in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Many individuals rebranded themselves into software development and other technical roles during the 2021-2022 tech boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. However, the tech market experienced a downturn in late 2022 and into 2023, causing once-lucrative job offers to disappear seemingly overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This has resulted in a "glut" of people who rebranded their careers now struggling to find jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### Remote Work Mandates

Companies are increasingly mandating a return to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Many who participated in the "Great Resignation" took remote positions with the expectation of a new work-life dynamic, but these opportunities have quickly dried up or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Those attempting to leave due to return-to-office or hybrid mandates are finding their phones not ringing as frequently as they did a couple of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Economic Cooldown and Salary Resets

There are increasing signs of an economic cooldown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, accompanied by a decrease in lucrative job offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Companies are resetting salaries, which negatively impacts those seeking to switch jobs primarily for a salary increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## The "Great Regret"

Many who participated in the "Great Resignation" are now feeling stuck or regretting their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This phenomenon is termed the "Great Regret," where people realize they may have made a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Career Changes

While not tolerating poor employers and reclaiming control of one's career are important, quitting a job should rarely be the first option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. A strategic approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] When to Consider Quitting
> Quitting is advisable in truly toxic situations, such as being asked to do something illegal or unethical, or experiencing bonafide harassment or a hostile work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. However, even in these cases, it's crucial to proceed with "eyes wide open" about the current labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

Given the [[current_challenges_in_the_job_market | current job market challenges]], it is recommended for gainfully employed individuals to:
*   Buckle down and focus on optimizing their resume to stand out in a competitive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   Seek the right opportunity rather than jumping for minor salary increases or due to minor workplace frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   Prioritize stability and industries with growth and strength over the next few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

Acting as the "CEO of your career" requires making smart, strategic decisions rather than knee-jerk reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Without a clear strategy, quitting a job without a new one lined up is not advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

Quitting your job right now might not be in your best interest, especially given the [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | current job market]] conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Many individuals seeking career coaching often want clarity on their job situation, frequently citing issues with management, feeling disrespected, being underpaid, or experiencing unfulfilling work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, it's often advised that quitting is not the optimal first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## State of the Job Market

The [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | job market]] is currently not very favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Many who have quit their jobs are discovering that replacing them is very difficult and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Some individuals who previously had no trouble receiving calls are now struggling to even secure a first-round interview, despite having strong backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Increased Competition

The [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | job market]] is extremely competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It's common for companies to receive thousands of applications for a single job opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This competitiveness is particularly amplified for highly sought-after roles like remote and even hybrid positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Companies are becoming less "remote-first," leading to a "feeding frenzy" of applicants, with competition doubling or even tripling compared to a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Comparison to Previous Years

Many job seekers, especially those not actively looking in the last couple of years, are realizing the [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | job market]] has significantly changed from 2021 and most of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This period was considered a "heyday for job seekers" where companies offered lucrative packages to attract talent due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### The Tech Boom and Bust

During the 2021-2022 period, many people rebranded themselves for technical roles like software developers to chase the tech boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, the bottom fell out of the tech market in late 2022 and into 2023, causing huge job offers to dry up seemingly overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This has created a surplus of individuals who have rebranded but are now struggling to find employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### The Great Resignation and Remote Work Mandates

Many individuals who participated in the "Great Resignation" secured remote positions under the premise that this would be their new work-life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. However, this trend has quickly reversed, with more companies now forcing employees back to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Those who quit their jobs seeking new remote or non-hybrid roles are finding their phones are not ringing as frequently as they did just a couple of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and the "Great Regret"

There are increasing signs of an economic cooldown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Parallel to this, lucrative job offers are becoming rarer as companies reset salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This situation makes it challenging for those looking to switch jobs for a salary increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Consequently, many who participated in the "Great Resignation" now feel stuck or regret their decisions, leading to a new phenomenon termed the "Great Regret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Strategic Career Decisions

While it's important not to tolerate poor employers and to reclaim control in your career, quitting your job should rarely be the first option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Decisions need to be made more strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] When to Consider Quitting
> Quitting might be necessary in a *truly* toxic situation, such as being asked to do something illegal or unethical, or experiencing bona fide harassment or a hostile work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Even in such cases, it's crucial to enter the [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | labor market]] with "eyes wide open," recognizing it's not the same as it was previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Recommendations for Job Seekers

If you are currently gainfully employed, the recommendation is to buckle down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Focus on preparing your resume to shine for the open market, ensuring you can compete effectively and get noticed by recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. It's vital to jump for the right opportunity, not just for a small salary increase or because of minor workplace annoyances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

> [!TIP] Focus on Stability
> Over the next few months, stability and finding a job or industry with growth and strength will be paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

To act like the CEO of your career, it's essential to make smart decisions rather than knee-jerk reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This may mean waiting for the perfect opportunity instead of quitting impulsively, as quickly landing another job is not a reality for many today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Most people approach their career without a strategy, which is not recommended before quitting a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Resources for Job Seekers

For those struggling to find luck in the job market, resources exist to help navigate the employment waters more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This includes training on:
*   Writing strategic resumes that attract recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
*   Approaching a job search strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
*   Navigating interview processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
*   Leveraging targeted networking via LinkedIn to potentially bypass recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>

An "ultimate career blueprint" framework can help in making the best decisions and acting like the CEO of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

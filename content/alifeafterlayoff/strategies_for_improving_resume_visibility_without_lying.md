In a challenging [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search]], it can be tempting to embellish a resume to gain an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, but outright [[temptation_and_consequences_of_lying_on_a_resume | lying on a resume]] can have severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Instead, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience suggests "massaging" or "manipulating" resume information to position oneself advantageously without fabricating facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The primary goal of a resume is to capture a recruiter's attention, who typically spends only five seconds scanning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Acceptable Resume Adjustments ("White Lies")

These adjustments aim to optimize a resume for recruiter visibility and improve the chances of receiving an interview call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

*   **Job Titles**
    *   If your previous job title was proprietary, it is acceptable to change it to a more common, generic market equivalent that aligns with the role you are applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This helps match what recruiters are searching for and increases discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Recruiters typically do not verify exact job titles with previous companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Name (for Contractors)**
    *   If you worked as a contractor through a third-party agency but primarily supported a well-known "alpha company," it may be acceptable to list the alpha company as your employer on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This is advisable if you had their email address, worked as part of their team, and your direct boss was from the alpha company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. However, be prepared to explain the third-party arrangement during background checks to avoid inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Location**
    *   If you are targeting a new geographic location and are prepared to relocate without company assistance, it can be acceptable to list your address in that new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This can give you a [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_improve_visibility_and_competitiveness | leg up]] in securing local market phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. However, this may mean forfeiting potential relocation assistance if the company would have offered it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.
*   **Dates of Employment**
    *   Instead of specific month and year dates, using only years (e.g., "2017-2020") can make your employment history look cleaner and more desirable, especially if you have periods of [[effective_job_search_strategies | job hopping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. While this isn't technically lying, it omits specific details, which a recruiter might ask about during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:06]</a>.
*   **Skills**
    *   If a job description lists "preferred" skills that are easily and quickly learnable (e.g., a common software program like Google Docs if you know Microsoft Word), it may be acceptable to include them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. The key is to be able to acquire and apply the skill functionally before you start the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
*   **Reason for Leaving a Job**
    *   Avoid explicitly stating on your resume or application that you were fired or laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Instead, you can leave it blank or simply state "better opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. This prevents immediate disqualification, giving you a chance to explain the situation later if asked directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

> "The moral of the story is with these white lies is we're not lying about what happened or what we have so much as we are kind of massaging things and making it look a little more palatable for a recruiter to make that initial call and then it's up to you to sell yourself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>

## Unacceptable Areas for Lying on a Resume

Lying on an official job application form can be considered falsification of a legal document and is a terminable offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Consequences can include rescinded job offers or termination if discovered after hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.

*   **Employer You Never Worked For**: Do not fabricate an employer you have never worked for, especially if the job requires specific experience from certain company types (e.g., FAANG companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. This will be exposed during the interview or background check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.
*   **References**: Never ask a friend to impersonate a previous boss or reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. It is better to honestly explain a difficult relationship with a previous boss and offer an alternative reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.
*   **Specific Employment Dates**: Do not add extra years to your employment history (e.g., fabricating a year or two) to cover employment gaps or inflate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. This is outright falsification and will be exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.
*   **Major, Non-Acquirable Skills**: Do not claim skills that are complex or time-consuming to learn (e.g., a new programming language) if you do not possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. You will be exposed during the interview process or set up for failure in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>.
*   **Education/Degrees**: Never lie about possessing a degree or certification you do not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>. Educational claims are verified during background checks, and falsifying them will result in a lost offer and potential [[strategies_for_managing_job_applications_and_avoiding_blacklisting | blacklisting]] from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.
*   **Criminal Record**: Do not omit or lie about a criminal record, especially a felony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. This will be discovered during a background check, and it is better to be honest and explain the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.
*   **Years of Experience**: Do not inflate your years of experience to meet job requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. You will likely be exposed during the interview, and even if hired, you would be set up for failure in a role beyond your current capabilities, potentially leading to job turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. It is better to find an [[effective_job_search_strategies | experience-appropriate position]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

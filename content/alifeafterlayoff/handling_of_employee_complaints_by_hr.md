When an employee brings a complaint to Human Resources (HR) about another employee, their boss, or general workplace conditions, they may inadvertently find themselves "on a list" or gaining a negative reputation [07:07:10]. While HR might state they will investigate, their typical first action is to consult with the complainant's boss or their boss's boss to discuss the complainant's performance [07:26:28]. They will also review the employee's file for any existing history with the employer [07:37:05].

## HR's Resolution Strategy

If complaints persist, HR might attempt to separate the situation [08:08:24]. However, their ultimate goal is often to remove what they perceive as the root problem, which is frequently the person who lodged the initial complaint [08:12:06].

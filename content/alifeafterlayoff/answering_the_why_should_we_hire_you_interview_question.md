The question "Why should we hire you?" is often considered one of the most feared [[commonly_asked_interview_questions | commonly asked interview questions]] for job seekers during the [[strategies_for_successful_job_interview_responses | interview process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article, based on insights from a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, aims to provide a clear strategy for answering this critical question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A poll conducted on LinkedIn revealed that "Why should we hire you?" was the question most job seekers were afraid of encountering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Understanding the Purpose of the Question

To effectively answer "Why should we hire you?", job seekers must first understand why the question is being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers ask this to gauge whether the job seeker understands what the company is trying to accomplish with the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It's crucial to understand why the position is open and why it needs to be filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### The Hiring Manager's Perspective: Solving a Business Problem
From a hiring manager's perspective, a new position is typically created to address a business gap or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This could be to replace an employee who left, or to meet a new business need, such as launching a new division, project, or requiring a specific skill set not currently available within the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This need generates a requisition and a job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### The Recruiter's Role
Before a position is recruited, recruiters conduct an "intake call" with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. During this call, they review job specifications, identify critical tasks for success, and understand the skills needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This process helps create an "ideal candidate profile" that outlines the business problem they are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Understanding this business problem is key to effectively answering "Why should we hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### How to Discover the Business Problem
Job seekers can uncover the business problem by:
*   **Paying close attention to the job description**: Highlight major points as they provide key indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Listening closely to the recruiter during the preliminary screen**: Recruiters provide valuable insights and keys that can be used in later interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. [[preparing_questions_to_ask_in_an_interview | Preparing questions to ask in an interview]] and actively listening are crucial for this phase, demonstrating the [[significance_of_asking_questions_in_an_interview | significance of asking questions in an interview]].

The "Why should we hire you?" question is most likely to be asked by the hiring manager, rather than the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## The Three-Part Formula for Answering

To effectively answer "Why should we hire you?", a three-part formula is suggested to provide a non-generic, targeted response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This approach is part of [[strategies_for_successful_job_interview_responses | strategies for successful job interview responses]] and [[strategies_for_answering_difficult_interview_questions | strategies for answering difficult interview questions]].

1.  **Understand Why the Position is Open**: Reiterate the business problem that the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. You need to demonstrate how you would fit into solving that specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

2.  **Link Your Past Experiences to the Business Problem**: Connect your professional background and accomplishments to the specific project or program the new position will address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Frame your answer by explaining how you have already solved similar problems in previous roles, showing a track record of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

3.  **Show How You Can Solve the Same Problem for Them**: Propose specific ways you would address their current business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This encourages the hiring manager to visualize you effectively performing the required tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls and What Not to Say

Many job seekers make the mistake of providing generic responses when asked "Why should we hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. These include phrases like:
*   "I'm a team player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I give 110%" (which is physically impossible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   "I'm a fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   "I achieve results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'll jump into your team and hit the ground running" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

These types of statements are "generic and fluffy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> and do not provide any meaningful information about the candidate's specific abilities to solve the company's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This represents a [[common_interview_question_pitfalls | common interview question pitfall]].

Instead, the ideal answer connects your past business results directly to solving the interviewer's specific business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. By following the three-part formula, you can demonstrate that you are the best candidate to "hit it out of the park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

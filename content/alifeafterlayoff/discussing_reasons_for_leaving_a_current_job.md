When interviewing for a new position, it's crucial to carefully consider how you articulate your reasons for leaving your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. While honesty is important, it's not always advisable to share the *entire* truth, especially if your reasons include disliking a boss, being bored, or feeling poorly treated by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## How Employers Interpret Your Reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>

Employers often judge candidates based on how they explain their departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Criticizing a Previous Boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
If you state that your boss was "terrible" or that you "butted heads" and "needed to get out," an employer might perceive you as difficult to work with or a potential problem for their own team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This can be a "red flag" that leads them to avoid hiring you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Expressing Boredom or Lack of Challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
Admitting that your previous job didn't challenge you can also be viewed negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Recruiters may interpret this as a lack of initiative, suggesting that a "go-getter" would have sought out more interesting work to enrich their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Oversharing Career Plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
Interviewers often ask about your career plans or where you see yourself in five years to gauge your commitment to the career path and your potential for growth in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Revealing plans to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely after a few years is generally not viewed positively and can even be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This signals a lack of passion for the type of work you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Conveying passion for the role is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Strategic Communication is Key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

Your goal is to articulate your genuine reasons for leaving in a way that doesn't appear threatening or problematic to a potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. If you have plans for a career shift or starting a business, carefully prepare how you will message this during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

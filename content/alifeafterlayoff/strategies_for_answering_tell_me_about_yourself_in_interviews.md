Brian from Life After Layoff, an experienced corporate recruiter, HR professional, career coach, and hiring manager, shares insights on how to effectively introduce yourself in a job interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This initial response sets the tone for the rest of your interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Understanding the "Tell Me About Yourself" Question

The question "Introduce yourself" or "Tell me about yourself" can cause anxiety due to its ambiguous nature, presenting a "massive blank slate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While it might seem like just an icebreaker, it serves a strategic purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It's an opportunity for you to demonstrate why you are a good fit for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

For astute candidates, this question is a chance to truly impress the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. At its highest level, the question aims to answer two key things:
*   Does the candidate possess the competency to perform the job? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Are they a good motivational fit for the role? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

As one of the first questions asked, it's your chance to shine and establish a positive impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## What Not to Say

When answering "Tell me about yourself," avoid common pitfalls:
*   **Don't Rehash Your Resume**
    The interviewer can read your resume, and specific questions about your background will come later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Don't Give a Life Summary**
    Stick to information relevant to the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Avoid personal stories about overcoming adversity as a child, European adventures, or hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Don't Ramble**
    Keep your answer concise, ideally between three to five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Long-winded answers are often seen as a "kiss of death" and can quickly lead to your application being declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If you find yourself rambling, cut to the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Don't Highlight Irrelevant Information**
    Skip details not directly related to the job, such as a side hustle as a personal trainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Focus on why you are a great fit and interested in this specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

*   **Review the Job Description**
    Read the job description carefully and highlight the major areas the company seems interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. These highlighted areas should be the focus of your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Connect Your Strengths to the Role**

## Example Answer

Consider an example for a senior-level recruiting position at a technical startup looking for someone to establish new processes and best practices:

> "I'm an expert level recruiting professional with extensive experience in full lifecycle recruiting for a variety of industries and companies, including FAANG, Fortune 50 firms, and even some privately held companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. I'm particularly proud of my ability to build strong consultative relationships with my business partners at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. I've worked with everybody from frontline leaders to C-suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. As an expert sourcer, I've utilized a full arsenal of recruiting tools including Boolean, X-ray search, LinkedIn Recruiter, AI, and some aggregators and even some good old-fashioned networking to help find the best candidate and all the while advocating for an exemplary candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Furthermore, I have led process improvements for major ATS system upgrades and I've been instrumental in supporting a major hiring initiative which resulted in hiring of a hundred engineers in nine months, which was actually a full six weeks ahead of target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Now, this position is a particular interest of mine because I've been looking to expand my skill set into the startup space and I've been seeking an opportunity to apply my skills in a new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. I'm happy to dive into anything I've mentioned more deeply, so ask away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>."

This example effectively calls out major points from the job description, demonstrates competency and breadth of experience, and expresses excitement and how the role aligns with career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This sets a favorable tone and establishes goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While the answer should not sound robotic, it should be a concise summary of your experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Aim for an answer preferably in the two to three-minute range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The last 18 months have led to a significant shift in the global workforce, dubbed "The Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon describes a period where people are voluntarily leaving their jobs en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Understanding The Great Resignation
Research conducted by Microsoft indicates that up to 41% of currently working individuals plan to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A record four million people voluntarily quit their jobs in April 2021 alone, according to the U.S. Labor Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This trend is surprising, considering the uncertain labor market at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

A poll conducted on a channel revealed that a majority of respondents who were employed were considering making a move, highlighting widespread job dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Driving Factors Behind Career Changes
Individuals are re-evaluating their lives and work after the events of the past year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Key reasons for this shift include:

### Reassessment of Commuting and Office Life
Many realized how much time was spent commuting and in an office setting, much of which could be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Historically, remote work carried a stigma of being less dedicated or hardworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Despite the value of in-person interaction and relationship building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, many found physical presence unnecessary for their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Unexpected Shift to Remote Work
The forced transition to remote work in 2020 demonstrated that many positions, particularly in white-collar and professional settings, can effectively be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The sudden closure of schools and the need for homeschooling also forced many to adapt, with flexible companies supporting employees more than rigid ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Corporate Over-Correction and Employee Burnout
Companies often overcorrected by implementing deep layoffs, anticipating a greater negative impact on their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. As markets recovered faster than expected, remaining employees were burdened with increased workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This, combined with constant digital meetings and a lack of real connection, led to widespread "digital burnout" and exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## The Evolving Job Market: A Candidate's Market
The current job market often favors employees, particularly at the hourly and professional levels, due to numerous open positions and fewer people to fill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This is seen as a "buyer's market" for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Companies that remain rigid in their philosophy regarding return-to-office mandates and remote work flexibility will likely struggle to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Remote work and work-life balance are no longer competitive advantages but are becoming standard expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Job seekers are increasingly prioritizing these factors over traditional concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Companies resistant to a blended work model will need to adapt to fill positions and avoid a competitive disadvantage in the recruitment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## The Importance of "Employment Experience"
The post-pandemic era is defined by the "employment experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes the way people work and live, from productivity and flexibility to well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

For companies to remain competitive, they must offer comprehensive packages that include:
*   **Financial benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
*   **Work-life balance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
*   **Flexibility of remote work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>

Companies that fail to provide these aspects will be left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Many individuals are choosing to leave their positions voluntarily because they are fed up with antiquated thought processes and business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. A significant number of those seeking [[career advice and job search strategies | career advice and job search strategies]] are gainfully employed but unsatisfied, seeking to move up or change their career path entirely rather than stay stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

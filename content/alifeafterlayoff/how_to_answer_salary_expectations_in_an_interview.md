When you land a big interview, a recruiter will likely ask about your salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Answering incorrectly can lead to rejection, as can avoiding the question entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Recruiter's Perspective on Salary Expectations

For a recruiter, the salary question is not a trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>. They genuinely want to know your [[discussing_salary_expectations | salary expectation]] to see if it fits within the company's established salary band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. This data is included in your initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.

The goal is to ensure that if an offer is extended, you will not only accept it but also be excited about the position, feeling that you received a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. If you accept a salary below your [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | expectation]], dissatisfaction can lead you to seek other opportunities, requiring the company to refill the position later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>. Therefore, the [[Importance of salary expectations for both employer and employee | salary question]] is important for both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:41">[01:50:41]</a>.

## Scenarios When [[Dealing with salary ranges and expectations | Discussing Salary Ranges]]

Assuming you're talking to a reputable employer, several scenarios can arise when [[handling_salary_discussions_during_interviews | discussing salary]].

### Your Salary Is Higher Than the Range

If your [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectation]] is too high for the role, you might be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:36">[02:25:36]</a>.
*   **Minor Difference**: If the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000 apart), some negotiation might occur even before further interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. The recruiter might gauge your flexibility by offering hypothetical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:20">[02:36:20]</a>.
*   **Significant Difference**: If the gap is substantial (e.g., $25,000 apart), it's unlikely an offer will make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:14">[02:54:14]</a>. The recruiter might suggest keeping you in mind for a more "enriched" future role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:19">[03:00:19]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidate Exception**: For a "superstar candidate" who is a perfect fit, a recruiter might still send your resume to the hiring manager with your accurate [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>. This could lead to the role being enriched to a higher level (e.g., Level 2 or 3), opening up wider salary ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>. However, this is the exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>.
*   **Honesty is Key**: Always be honest with your expectations. Trying a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>.

### Your Salary Is Lower Than the Range

If your [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectation]] is lower than the company's band for the role, this is often a positive situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:01">[04:03:01]</a>.
*   **Company Salary Bands**: Major corporations use salary bands (minimum, midpoint, maximum) typically based on local market wage surveys and internal equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:08">[04:14:08]</a>. Internal equity ensures similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:07">[04:25:07]</a>.
*   **Automatic Adjustment**: If your [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | compensation expectation]] is below the lowest point of the range, you will automatically be raised to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:23">[04:50:23]</a>.
*   **Common Scenarios**: This often occurs when a candidate comes from a less reputable or smaller company without similar salary bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:05">[04:59:05]</a>, or when stepping into a next-level role with a significant gap from previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:44">[05:07:44]</a>.

### Refusing to Answer the Question

Refusing to answer or giving a vague response will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:17">[05:54:17]</a>. Recruiters need to know if a deal can be made and may suspect you are hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## [[Preparing to ask questions in an interview | Preparing to Answer the Salary Question]]

To effectively answer, you need to know three key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:15">[06:17:15]</a>:

1.  **Average Salary Range**: Determine the average [[role_of_salary_expectations_in_job_offers | salary range]] for this type of role in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:07">[06:20:07]</a>. Research sources like Google, Glassdoor, Salary.com, and recently posted similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:03">[06:34:03]</a>. Ensure your comparisons are realistic and based on your local area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Company's Expectation**: Understand what the company is expecting to pay for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:22">[07:03:22]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom Line**: Know your absolute minimum [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectation]]â€”the point at which you would walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:08">[07:07:08]</a>. You don't necessarily share this number with the recruiter, but you must know it yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:03">[07:18:03]</a>.

## [[Handling salary expectations and negotiations appropriately | How to Answer the Question]]

There are several effective ways to [[handling_questions_about_salary_expectations | answer the salary expectation question]]:

### 1. Give Your Expectation Directly

If you are confident in your worth and believe the company is in a similar ballpark, you can state your actual number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:07">[07:26:07]</a>. Ensure the number is reasonable and something you can live with, as you will work with it throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:03">[07:36:03]</a>.

### 2. Frame it with Market Research

If you suspect the company might offer a lowball or you are significantly above their expectation, frame your answer with market data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:26">[07:44:26]</a>:
> "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110 thousand. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:39">[07:51:39]</a>
This puts the onus on the company to disclose their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:19">[08:00:19]</a>.

### 3. Put the Question Back on the Recruiter

If you are interested in the opportunity and willing to consider a lower salary but are worried about pricing yourself out, you can try this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:07">[08:09:07]</a>:
> "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bans that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:47">[08:20:47]</a>
The recruiter may push back, so still have an answer prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:02">[08:40:02]</a>. Avoid being ambiguous or waiting until the offer to negotiate, as this can annoy hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:03">[08:49:03]</a>. If you sense frustration from the recruiter, just give them an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:01">[09:05:01]</a>.

The rise of remote work, significantly accelerated by global events in the last 18 months, has led to a phenomenon dubbed "The Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This refers to people voluntarily leaving their jobs en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Great Resignation Explained

Research by Microsoft indicated that up to 41% of currently working individuals planned to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The U.S. Labor Department reported a record four million people voluntarily quit their jobs in April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, marking the beginning of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Many individuals surveyed indicated they were employed but considering a career change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Drivers of the Shift to Remote Work

The main catalyst for this shift was the realization by employees that they were spending too much time commuting and in traditional office settings that were often unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Previously, [[the_impact_of_remote_work_and_modern_hiring_platforms | remote work]] often carried a stigma, with perceptions that remote employees were less dedicated or not fully part of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Despite this, remote workers often put in more hours than those in an office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Personal experiences, such as lengthy commutes (e.g., 4.5 to 5 hours a day for one individual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, highlighted the non-value-added time spent in offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Pandemic's Forced Adaptation

In 2020, companies with traditional work models were suddenly forced to [[adapting_to_postpandemic_work_models | adapt]] and enable most of their workforce to work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This revealed that many more positions than previously thought, especially white-collar or professional roles, could effectively be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The unexpected closure of schools and the need for homeschooling also underscored the need for workplace flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_returning_to_office_postpandemic | Challenges of Returning to Office Post-Pandemic]]

After 18 months of remote work, many employees began to question the necessity of the traditional office model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Some CEOs and leadership teams, like those in certain financial services companies, have been insistent on employees returning to the office, often without a clear business reason beyond "facetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This rigid approach has also extended to punitive policies, such as reducing an employee's salary if they move to a lower cost-of-living area while performing the same job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## [[job_market_competition_and_strategies_for_remote_positions | Job Market Competition]] and Employer Adaptation

The current job market often favors employees, particularly at the hourly level, creating a "buyer's market" due to numerous open positions and fewer applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Companies that remain rigid in their return-to-office philosophies will likely struggle to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Flexible work arrangements, including remote and [[shift_towards_hybrid_work_models | hybrid work models]], are becoming standard expectations rather than competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Not offering these options can be a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Overloaded Employees and Digital Burnout

During the pandemic, many companies overcorrected by implementing deep [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]], anticipating a greater impact on their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. When the market rebounded faster than expected, remaining employees were burdened with significant extra work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This led to increased workload, exhaustion, and "digital burnout" from constant online meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Employees became fed up with this overload and inflexible leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## The Importance of Employee Experience

Companies must now focus on the "employment experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes the way people work and live, including productivity, flexibility, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. To remain competitive and attract talent, companies must offer:
*   Clear career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
*   Improved [[impacts_of_long_commutes_and_workplace_culture_on_personal_life_and_job_satisfaction | work-life balance]] (e.g., not expecting 60-70 hour work weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
*   Full-time employment over contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
*   Competitive flexible work arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>
*   Financial benefits, work-life balance, and remote work flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>

Without these, companies risk being left behind in the [[impact_on_remote_workers_and_job_seekers | labor market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Many individuals are also making significant career changes, seeking roles that offer more satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The shift in employee priorities is forcing companies to adapt, which is ultimately seen as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

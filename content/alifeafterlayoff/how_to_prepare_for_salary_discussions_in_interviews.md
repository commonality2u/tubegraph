Navigating the interview process requires careful consideration of what to say and what to avoid, particularly when it comes to compensation. Saying the wrong thing can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## When Not to Bring Up Salary

It is important to avoid asking about salary too early in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. While it's understood that candidates want to be fairly compensated, bringing up the question "right out of the gate" is considered a "big turn off" for employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. At this early stage, you may not even know the full scope of the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Instead, allow the recruiter to initiate the discussion about salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This ensures that your motivation for interviewing is not questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Avoid Second-Round Salary Inquiries

If you progress to the second round of interviews, do not ask the hiring manager about pay ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This is considered an "even bigger turn off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Typically, the HR department, the talent acquisition (TA) team, and the hiring manager collaborate to determine a fair offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, and the hiring manager rarely has the final say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Asking again suggests you are "fishing for a better answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Answering Salary Expectation Questions

While you shouldn't initiate the salary discussion, you *must* be prepared to answer when the recruiter asks about your [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Be Prepared

Not knowing how to answer this question or responding with statements like "I don't know what the local market pays for this type of job" or "I'd have to get back to you on that after I think about it" indicates that you are "completely unprepared" for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

You should have a clear number in mind that you need to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Avoiding the question altogether or attempting to defer it to later in the process will likely prevent you from advancing to the next interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

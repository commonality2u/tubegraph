Identifying [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] in job postings is crucial for job seekers to recognize their self-worth and [[avoiding_toxic_workplace_environments | avoid toxic workplace environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These "absurd and ridiculous" job requirements often reveal underlying issues within an organization, signaling a potentially [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Common Red Flags in Job Advertisements

Several types of job postings can indicate a low-quality or [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

### 1. Extremely Low Pay for High Qualifications

A significant [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] is a job offering wages significantly below industry standards or even minimum wage, despite requiring advanced degrees and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Accounting Role
> A remote accounting role offered $1,400 a month (approximately $8.75/hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The requirements included two years of experience with US-based businesses and a bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
>
> This pay is considered below poverty level and insufficient to pay off student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. An entry-level accounting job should realistically pay $45,000 to $50,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### 2. Employee Handbook Penalties for Quitting

Employers who attempt to charge employees for leaving the organization exhibit "anti-employee" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Restaurant Handbook Charges
> An employee handbook for a restaurant listed various charges against an employee's final pay upon leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>:
> *   Handbook fee: $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
> *   Training manual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
> *   File processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
> *   Payroll processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
> *   W-2 processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
> *   Uniform costs (t-shirt): $12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
> *   Training cost reimbursement: $25 a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
> *   Hiring processing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
>
> Such practices are unheard of in reputable companies and may even be questionable legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This indicates a "super low quality employer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### 3. Rejecting Candidates for Punctuality

An employer rejecting a candidate for arriving exactly on time for an interview is an extreme [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | unrealistic employer demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Interview Punctuality
> A recruiter emailed a candidate stating they wouldn't consider them for a full-time position because they arrived "exactly on time" to an 11 AM interview, suggesting arriving earlier would "show an employer that you are keen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
>
> This reflects an "overly power-hungry" recruiter or hiring manager with ridiculous requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. While showing up a few minutes early is generally recommended for the candidate's benefit, rejecting someone for being precisely on time is absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### 4. Unpaid "Test Work" or Intellectual Property

Asking candidates to perform unpaid work as part of the interview process or to solve real business problems without compensation is exploitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Restaurant "Work for a Couple of Hours"
> A hiring manager asked a candidate to "come in and work for a couple of hours to see if you like the job." When the candidate asked if they would be paid, the manager replied "No, not for that day," then immediately rescinded the offer, stating, "it doesn't look like it's going to work out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
>
> This demonstrates a "very very [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]]" where questioning free labor is seen as a "cultural issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
>
> > [!WARNING] Free Consulting
> > Job seekers should be cautious if asked to produce a project or presentation that solves an actual business scenario for the company, as they might be seeking "free consultative services" and implement the ideas without hiring the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. No reputable company makes candidates do this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### 5. Unpaid "Startup" Roles

Startups are often [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] because they may be poorly funded or led by individuals lacking business acumen or people management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Unpaid Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
> A "legitimate job posting" for a Marketing Manager/CMO stated that "initially, you will work with the founding team as we secure VC funding on a part-time unpaid basis before coming on board full-time as a on a paid basis once we secure funding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
>
> Such a proposal asks a highly skilled individual to work for free with no guarantee of future pay or success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. This is often an attempt to take advantage of desperate job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### 6. Extremely Wide Salary Ranges

In pay transparency states, some companies list absurdly wide salary ranges to obscure actual compensation expectations, indicating dishonesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] $150,000 to $890,000 Base Salary
> A large tech company posted a base salary range of $150,000 to $890,000 for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
>
> This seven-hundred-thousand-dollar spread is a "shady" tactic by companies forced to comply with pay transparency laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. It's designed to prevent candidates from accurately assessing their worth for the role and can lead to mismatched salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Such deceit in the first interaction with a company suggests they "probably going to be shady throughout the rest of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### 7. Unrealistic Generalist Roles

Job postings that combine highly specialized, disparate roles, particularly for part-time or low-paying positions, are often signs of a disorganized or understaffed operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Website Business Developer & Landscaper
> A part-time position in Calgary, Canada, offered $20-$25/hour (Canadian) for a "website business developer and a landscaper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. The role required website development, advertising, sales of eco-friendly landscape services, and up to 50% physical labor for landscaping and snow removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
>
> This "mom and pop" operation expects a business student with web development skills to also perform manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Candidates were required to be registered with a Canadian post-secondary school and the contract was only 8 to 16 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### 8. Overqualified Internships

Expecting interns to possess professional designations or extensive experience, typically reserved for seasoned professionals, indicates a severe disconnect from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Insurance & Wealth Internship
> A four-month student internship required "advanced knowledge of insurance and wealth products," "understanding advisor compensation," knowledge of proprietary internal admin systems, a post-secondary education, AND professional designations like CPA, CFA, or CSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
>
> This highlights how skewed employers' expectations are from reality for an internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Such roles likely offer very low pay or none at all, despite demanding high-level analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

### 9. Bizarre Application Requirements

Unusual or intrusive requests in a job application, unrelated to job performance, are a strong indicator of a troublesome employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Photo of Your Fridge
> One job application asked for a "photo of the inside of your fridge" in addition to a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
>
> This could be a recruiter "gone rogue" or a hiring manager with "unrealistic expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. Such arbitrary demands signal a "cumbersome interview process at best or a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] employer at worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## Why These Red Flags Occur

Many of these absurd requirements stem from a lack of proper Human Resources (HR) or Talent Acquisition (TA) departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Smaller companies, such as startups or restaurants, often operate like the "Wild Wild West" without check and balances, leading to "stupid things" and ridiculous requirements because they "literally don't know better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## The Importance of Self-Respect

Ultimately, these obvious [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | signs of a toxic workplace]] in job postings are a favor to the job seeker, as they clearly identify "low quality employers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. It is crucial to have self-respect and avoid applying for such "garbage" jobs, as working for a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic employer]] will never help you get ahead in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

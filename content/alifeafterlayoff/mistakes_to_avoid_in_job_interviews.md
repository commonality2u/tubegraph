Navigating the interview process can be challenging, often compared to traversing a minefield, where a single misstep can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While various factors can lead to job rejection, such as motivational mismatches or a lack of relevant experience, what you say—or don't say—frequently determines if you end up in the "no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Even seemingly innocent statements can result in rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

As a corporate recruiter, the following are 10 things you should never say or do in a job interview if you're serious about getting the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## 1. Asking What the Company Does

Asking what the company does for its core business demonstrates a lack of preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Candidates are expected to conduct basic research beforehand on the company's products, divisions, competitors, and any new technology it has rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Without this research, it's difficult to convince an interviewer of your genuine interest in the company's mission, vision, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Research also helps determine if the company's core values align with your own, preventing a potential cultural mismatch that could lead to misery and turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## 2. Asking What the Role Is

While interviewers will provide some detail about the position, candidates are expected to have thoroughly read the job description and understand what the role aims to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Asking "what the position is or does" suggests minimal preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Companies seek problem-solvers, not individuals who need constant guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## 3. Inquiring About the Hours

For salaried, non-exempt employees applying for professional-level positions, asking about the hours is generally discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Even with valid concerns from previous experiences, this question can make you appear to be a "clock watcher," which is an unfavorable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, rephrase your concern by asking about the company culture, expectations for the first 90 days, or shift support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## 4. Asking About Immediate Promotional Opportunities

While a desire for career progression is reasonable, immediately asking about "when you're going to get the boss's job" suggests a lack of interest in the position you're currently interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. It's better to inquire about career paths and potential long-term growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Frame your questions to demonstrate genuine excitement for the role at hand and a desire to learn about the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## 5. Initiating Discussion About Salary

Bringing up salary questions "right out of the gate" is a significant turn-off for employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. It suggests a focus on pay before understanding the position's responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It's preferable for the recruiter to initiate this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If you advance to later rounds, avoid asking the hiring manager about pay ranges, as the HR/TA team typically handles this, and the hiring manager rarely has the final say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Doing so might make them think you're "fishing for a better answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## 6. Not Answering Salary Expectation Questions

When asked about your salary expectations, avoiding the question or stating you're unprepared indicates a lack of readiness for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. You should have a clear number in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Failing to answer this question will likely prevent you from progressing to the next interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## 7. Speaking Poorly of Previous Employers or Bosses

It can be tempting to vent about negative past experiences, but interviewers are generally not interested in hearing grievances about "crappy bosses" or "messy former companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Their focus is solely on assessing your fit for their company and role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Badmouthing past experiences reflects poorly on you; instead, be gracious, demonstrate learning, and show genuine interest in the current opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## 8. Stating How Nervous You Are

While some degree of nervousness is understandable, especially in a stressful job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, dwelling on your nervousness can hurt your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Recruiters might offer "softball questions" to help you relax, but they expect you to eventually "take ownership of the interview" and project confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Hiring managers often have less patience for pronounced nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The best advice is to be well-prepared to effectively sell yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## 9. Being Overly Casual

While a relaxed demeanor can help break the ice, being too casual can be offensive, especially if it involves "colorful language" or treating the interviewer like a "buddy" in a social setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Err on the side of caution with first names, generally mirroring how they introduce themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Avoid terms like "boss" or "bro," as they can be perceived as derogatory and create an unfavorable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Maintaining a polished and professional approach is best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## 10. Not Asking Questions

At the end of an interview, interviewers expect you to have a list of "well-thought-out, intelligent questions" about the company, culture, and how you might fit into the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Not asking any questions indicates a lack of interest or awareness regarding your potential fit for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Always come prepared with questions to show you are engaged in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

By avoiding these [[common_interview_mistakes | common mistakes in the hiring process]], you can significantly improve your chances of making a favorable impression and securing the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

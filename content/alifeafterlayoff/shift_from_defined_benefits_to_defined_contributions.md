The traditional employment model featured a [[changes_in_employment_benefits_over_generations | defined benefits plan]], most commonly through pensions, where employers paid for the entirety of an employee's retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## The Transition
A significant [[changing_employer_employee_relationship | shift]] occurred in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, moving from [[changes_in_employment_benefits_over_generations | defined benefits]] to [[changes_in_employment_benefits_over_generations | defined contribution plans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This change effectively transferred the entire burden of retirement funding onto the employee, with employers providing only a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Impact on Employee and Employer
This shift in [[compensation_and_benefits_strategy | compensation and benefits strategy]] brought several changes:
*   **Reduced Employer Commitment** Employers are now less committed to employees, as they no longer bear the primary cost of retirement programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This has allowed employers to "decouple" from the employee, making them less bound by long-term commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Vesting Periods** Companies frequently implemented long vesting periods, often four years or more, before employees could claim the employer's retirement match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If an employee was laid off before the vesting period, the employer would reclaim their matched contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Employee Financial Responsibility** Employees can no longer rely on employers to fund even a 401k, especially given the increased frequency of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This places the onus on employees to strategically plan for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This can be particularly disruptive for those nearing retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Shifting Loyalty Narrative** While older generations may lament a lack of loyalty in younger employees, the shift in benefit structures indicates that the employer-employee [[changing_employer_employee_relationship | relationship]] has changed from both sides, with employers initiating much of the decoupling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

This fundamental change means individuals must approach their careers and [[financial_planning_after_a_layoff | financial planning]] as a "free agent" or "CEO of their career," rather than relying on an employer to prioritize their best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

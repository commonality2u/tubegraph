Being careful about what you say in the workplace is crucial, as "loose lips sink ships" and can lead to significant trouble with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This requires extreme caution about what you disclose to co-workers and other people in a workplace setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A former HR professional emphasizes that many common issues arise from employees oversharing with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Political Discussions
Avoid discussing anything political in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Regardless of your political stance, these discussions are often a "hot button" issue and will likely upset someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Political conversations are prone to arguments, and you're unlikely to convince the other person to change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It's also wise to be aware of your company's general political leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Off-Color Jokes
Refrain from telling off-color jokes to co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Even if you consider a joke innocent, the recipient might interpret it as offensive, leading to complaints to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The intention behind a joke doesn't matter as much as how it is received by the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It's best to stick to "dumb dad jokes" or avoid jokes altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Complimenting Physical Attributes
Avoid complimenting co-workers on their physical attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Even if you mean it innocently, you cannot control how the person will interpret it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. HR has received complaints from employees feeling uncomfortable due to such comments, even when the giver claimed innocent intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Keep comments professional; for instance, "that hairdo looks great on you" is acceptable, but ensure it remains professional and not "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Assuming Pregnancy
Never assume someone is pregnant and call it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The two possible outcomes are that they are pregnant but not ready to disclose it, or they are not pregnant at all, both of which can offend the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Always let the individual take the lead on disclosing such personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Discussing Litigation Against the Company
If you are involved in or planning litigation against your company, keep it to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Do not "spill the beans" on the company's "dirt" or your lawsuit strategy to co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Such disclosures could lead to colleagues taking notes for the company's defense or the company taking proactive measures, which could jeopardize your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Only your attorney should be privy to this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Sharing Salary Information
While salary transparency is generally beneficial, it is not recommended to discuss your salary within your own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Sharing salaries can lead to employees realizing they are underpaid and becoming upset, potentially causing them to quit or demand higher compensation from management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This can cause management to lose trust in you, even if there are legitimate reasons for pay differences (e.g., skill, experience, or changes in the job market), which could hinder future promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For sharing salary information, use anonymous platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Borrowing or Lending Money
Avoid borrowing money from or getting into business with co-workers, similar to the adage about friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Such situations often end poorly for the person who lent the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Asking a co-worker for money can also create an uncomfortable situation for them, potentially leading to an HR report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Negative Comments About Your Boss
Do not say anything negative about your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even if you feel justified or have a "work ally" who also complains, be extremely cautious, as such comments often "come back to bite you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The boss somehow always finds out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This is part of [[avoiding_negative_discussions_about_past_employers | avoiding negative discussions about employers]].

### [[navigating_workplace_gossip and its impact | Gossiping About Co-workers]]
Refrain from [[navigating_workplace_gossip_and_its_impact | gossiping about other co-workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Developing a reputation as a gossip is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. If co-workers discover you're talking about them behind their backs, they are likely to file a complaint or inform management, bringing unwanted attention to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## General Advice

To protect your career and avoid legal issues, it is best to "take the high road" and treat co-workers with a high degree of [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. While you can be friendly, be very careful about what you say and disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Browsing job postings can sometimes lead down a "Reddit rabbit hole" of "cringe-worthy opportunities" offered by "poor quality employers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These opportunities, often described as predatory, exploit job seekers unless candidates refuse to accept their terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Arming oneself with the tools to effectively sell skills in an interview can help avoid settling for such "utter garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

[[Red flags in job advertisements | Red flags in job advertisements]] are clear indicators that a job or company might be problematic. Employers often offer "extreme incentives" like inflated salaries to compensate for a poor work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Accepting these "garbage opportunities" only enables employers to continue offering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Common Red Flags in Job Postings

### Unpaid or Underpaid Positions

Many [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] are related to compensation:

*   **Temporary Non-Paid Positions**: Some postings, like for a "Live Show Programming Assistant" in New York City, explicitly state they are "temporary non-paid positions," asking applicants not to apply if they "cannot work without pay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This is often illegal, as the Department of Labor has regulations for internships that dictate when a company can avoid paying, usually requiring the work to be related to coursework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **High Requirements for Low Pay**: Another [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | low quality job posting]] may demand a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, five years of development experience, and five total years of IT experience for a wage as low as $11 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This translates to roughly $22,880 annually, which is significantly less than the $75,000-$80,000 minimum expected for an entry-level software developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This is considered "absolute garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Unstable Compensation**: Some startups openly admit they are "not for people who need a stable and well-paying job" and confess to being in the "same situation" financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. They may state that "salaries will be slightly below market rates" in the beginning, promising an "amazing dinner" after their first fundraising round instead of fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This suggests working "80-90 hour weeks" for significantly less than market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Absurd and Excessive Application Processes

Companies sometimes expect candidates to "jump through" an obnoxious amount of "hoops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>:

*   **Multi-Hour Assessments without Interview Guarantee**: One personal experience involved a company aggressively pursuing a candidate with a high salary offer (a [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | warning sign]] in itself) but requiring three to five hours of assessments with no guarantee of even a preliminary phone interview with a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Overly Complex Pre-Interview Tasks**: An "Agile Coach" position required numerous steps before a first call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>:
    *   Sending a resume in MS Word format via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    *   Sending a LinkedIn connection request to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Reading a specific LinkedIn article about their market differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   Watching a particular video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   Ensuring Zoom video functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   Matching availability with the recruiting director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
    *   Sending a text message to the recruiting director's personal phone number confirming Zoom functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   Reviewing an entire list of interview tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This entire process is deemed a "clown show" and completely contradictory to the "agile" methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Unpaid Projects for Interviews**: For a rotational management program, candidates were asked to create a project, which takes an average of "six to eight hours," with only 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for Q&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This is an "entire work day" of unpaid effort with no guarantee of advancing, making it a "huge waste of everybody's time" for those not selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. [[Red flags in job interviews | Self-respecting employers]] generally do not ask for this, except possibly for very senior roles where presenting a business idea is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Toxic Work Environment and Lack of Stability

Job postings can reveal [[toxic_workplace_signs_in_job_postings | toxic workplace signs]]:

*   **Excessive Surveillance and Productivity Tracking**: A remote position included "tracking software," "productivity tracking," and "keyword tracking software" that monitored keystrokes and took camera pictures every 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Failure to maintain productivity or walking away from the computer could result in a call from a "productivity coach" to review "wasted time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This environment was pitched as a "great opportunity" for productivity and happiness, but it eliminates basic human needs like bathroom breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Disclaimers about Instability and Lack of Support**: Some startups explicitly state the opportunity "is not for people who need a stable and well-paying job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> and warn that "early stage startups have shifting priorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. They may even imply they cannot provide mentorship or direction, as management "probably don't know themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### Insulting Application Requirements

Some [[absurd_job_requirements_and_red_flags | absurd job requirements]] are simply insulting:

*   **Detailed Essays for Low-Level Jobs**: A part-time, contract legal administrative assistant position paying $15-18 an hour required a cover letter of no more than two paragraphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The first paragraph needed to explain the three most important qualities for the role and why, and the second why the candidate applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. The closing sentence had to be: "I have read the instructions contained in the job posting and have followed the instructions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, implying the applicant is "too stupid" to follow instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid Fake or Low-Quality Postings

If you encounter these [[strategies_to_identify_and_avoid_fake_job_postings | red flags]], it's crucial to exercise "self-respect" and avoid applying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

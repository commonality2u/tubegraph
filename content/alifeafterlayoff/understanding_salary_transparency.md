[[salary_transparency_and_disclosure | Salary transparency]] is a growing trend, particularly in certain U.S. states, where companies are mandated to publish salary ranges in job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This practice aims to provide job seekers with more data points for [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectations]] and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## States with [[salary_transparency_and_disclosure | Pay Transparency]] Laws

Several states and cities have enacted [[salary_transparency_and_disclosure | pay transparency]] laws, including:
*   Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>
*   New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>
*   Connecticut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>

More states are continuing to adopt similar legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

## Employer Approaches to [[salary_transparency_and_disclosure | Salary Range]] Disclosure

When faced with [[salary_transparency_and_disclosure | salary transparency]] requirements, companies typically adopt different strategies for publishing [[salary_transparency_and_disclosure | salary ranges]]:

### Realistic Ranges
Some legitimate companies will publish realistic ranges, for example, between $60,000 and $85,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. These ranges are often the result of internal discussions among hiring managers, who consider factors like preventing disruptions to [[understanding_employer_salary_bands_and_internal_equity | internal equity]] while still attracting high-quality candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

### Exaggerated or "Shady" Ranges
Other companies, particularly larger tech companies, may publish extremely wide and unrealistic ranges to avoid truly disclosing salary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. An example observed was a base salary range from $150,000 to $890,000, representing a $700,000 spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

This "shady" tactic is often a sign of companies begrudgingly complying with regulations they dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Red Flag Employer
> A company that publishes an excessively wide salary range in a job posting may be signaling a deceitful or dishonest character in their initial interaction with candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. This could indicate similar problematic behaviors throughout the hiring process and even during actual employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

While having [[selfreported_salary_data_and_reliability | salary data]] is helpful for job seekers, individuals who understand their own market value may not strictly need these disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. However, the character of a company willing to be deceitful in its public job postings should be a [[salary_and_benefits_issues | red flag]] for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

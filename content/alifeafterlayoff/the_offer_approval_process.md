The job offer process can feel lengthy, with weeks often passing after interviews before a formal offer is extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This article aims to [[reasons_job_offers_take_a_long_time | demystify]] the behind-the-scenes workings of talent acquisition and human resources departments concerning job offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Initial Stages and Offer Calculation

After the interviewing process concludes, a debrief meeting occurs with all stakeholders who interviewed the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. During this meeting, each interviewer provides a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" on moving forward with an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. If a near-unanimous consensus is reached, the offer process begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

The human resources department or talent acquisition group then compiles offer details, considering several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>:
*   **Candidate Compensation Expectation** Notes from preliminary interviews are reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Local Market Wage Data** Industry-standard compensation data is consulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Salary Bands** Companies typically have salary bands with a minimum, mid-point, and maximum (or 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Most candidates are kept at or below the 50th percentile to maintain internal equity and allow for future salary increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Placing a candidate at the top of the range could prevent future merit increases, which might disincentivize long-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This process is typical for large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Comparators** Salaries of other employees in similar roles within the organization are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

If a candidate's salary expectation is significantly higher than the average for the role, the company makes strategic decisions on the offer amount or creative compensation structures that don't negatively impact the existing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter's role includes advocating for the candidate to ensure the offer is compelling enough to be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## The Approval Chain

Once an offer amount is determined, it goes through several layers of approval, typically three or four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>:
1.  **Hiring Manager** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>
2.  **Hiring Manager's Boss** (Hiring Manager plus one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>
3.  **Human Resources Approval** Often an HR business partner separate from the talent acquisition team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
4.  In some cases, the recruiting or talent acquisition team may have final approval before the offer is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

After approvals, the recruiter creates the official offer letter and contacts the candidate to present it and begin any [[negotiating_a_counter_offer | negotiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This part of the process alone can take at least a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Factors Causing Delays

Several factors can cause [[reasons_job_offers_take_a_long_time | delays]] in the offer process:

*   **Salary Expectations Too High** If a candidate's salary expectation significantly stretches the salary band, the HR department and hiring manager may discuss "enriching the role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Companies expect more from candidates for whom they've stretched financially, so it's important to target roles properly scoped for one's experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Accepting a role below one's expectation can lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Unavailable Approvers** If key approvers are on vacation or engaged in business meetings, the process is stalled until they can provide their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Senior Management Misalignment** Sometimes, a senior manager may not fully agree with the hiring manager's profile choice, leading to a re-evaluation or "rescoping" of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This can halt the offer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Demand for a Full Slate of Candidates** Even if a top candidate is identified, some managers insist on interviewing a full slate of candidates, adding weeks to the recruiting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Recruiters often push back on this, as candidate engagement typically wanes after two to three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Process Bloat** Some companies have administrative or procedural "extra steps" and cumbersome software systems that slow down the process due to checks, balances, or auditing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Team Slowness and Overload** Individual team members (recruiter, hiring manager, HR) may be slow to act, forget about the offer, or be overloaded with other responsibilities, causing the offer to get buried in their priority list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

## Candidate Experience

Lengthy offer processes negatively impact the candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, and most recruiters are frustrated by these delays, as they want to fill positions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

> As a candidate, if you're waiting on an offer that's taking a long time, it's advisable to "nudge the hiring team," particularly the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Checking in every two or three days is acceptable, as recruiters also have a sense of urgency to get the offer approved and into your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

The philosophy one holds regarding work – whether to "live to work" or "work to live" – is a frequent topic in private consultation sessions, especially for individuals feeling unsatisfied or lacking motivation in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This core concept underpins much of the career advice offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Defining the Philosophies

*   **Work to Live:** This philosophy suggests that individuals work primarily to support a desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It's about earning a living to enjoy life outside of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. There is nothing inherently wrong with this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Live to Work:** This implies that work or a career is a person's primary purpose or driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. People with this philosophy often feel a burning passion for their professional lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

It is estimated that approximately 70% of the working population likely "works to live," meaning they would pursue something entirely different if they won the lottery today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Widespread Career Dissatisfaction

Many people struggle with their career direction or are simply not satisfied with their current work, lacking the motivation and burning drive they feel they should have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While externally they may appear successful and content, many secretly experience a "sense of dread" on Monday mornings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Spending 20-30 years in a career without passion is considered concerning given the significant portion of life dedicated to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Causes of Dissatisfaction

Several factors contribute to individuals feeling unsatisfied in their careers:

### Workplace Culture and Politics
Many jobs involve dealing with cultural issues that don't align with personal core values, or navigating complex office politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. In the corporate world, missteps in the "political game" or being in the wrong place at the wrong time can sidetrack a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Getting on the wrong side of a boss or co-worker can lead to significant career turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Unfulfilling Career Paths
Some individuals find themselves in career paths that do not provide deep, core satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. They may simply "power through" the work week, looking forward to the weekend, only to feel dread as Sunday afternoon approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Job Overloading and Lack of Work-Life Balance
Many jobs today demand more than the traditional 40-hour work week, with 60-70 hour weeks becoming common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This overload can lead to employees feeling "worked to death" and unable to take vacations for fear of workload accumulation or accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Such environments indicate a lack of resources and a need for more hiring to distribute the workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Most people desire [[work_life_balance_and_its_role_in_job_satisfaction | work-life balance]], wanting to do a fair job for a fair day's pay, and then spend time with family, pursue hobbies, and enjoy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. However, cultures like that in the United States, which are highly work-driven, make this difficult, contributing to career dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This perpetual cycle of being overworked, jaded, or in a toxic workplace culture leads to job burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## The Path to Dissatisfaction

Often, people enter the workforce without a clear "end game" or goal in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. They might take the first job available after college for experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The first few companies or promotions shape their career path, often leading them down an unplanned trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

As individuals progress, they become "branded" by the type of work they do, making it easier to be recruited into similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Eventually, they may feel "trapped" due to accustomed [[financial_and_lifestyle_implications_of_contracting | lifestyle]] and [[salary_growth_through_job_transitions_versus_staying_in_the_same_role | salary ranges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

The realization of disliking their career often hits between the 10- to 20-year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. At this point, pivoting to a different career can be very difficult, risking a step backward in salary or finding another unfulfilling path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Avoiding Career Pitfalls

The symptom of dissatisfaction often stems from a lack of a "guiding light" or definitive plan early in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Without such a plan, careers can unfold aimlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, leading to the regret of having "wasted 20 years" doing something unfulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Advantages for Early Career Individuals
Those early in their careers or just out of college have a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. They have the "power of time" on their side, allowing them to:
*   **Put a plan in place:** Take calculated steps towards their desired career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This proactive approach leads to [[differences_between_steady_career_paths_and_proactive_career_management | proactive career management]].
*   **Afford to take risks:** Experiment with different roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **"Cut bait" early:** If a job or path doesn't resonate, it's easier to change direction without getting stuck in a vertical that is uninteresting or unpassionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Pivoting Later in Career
While more challenging, it is possible to pivot a career after age 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. It requires a more calculated decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The goal is to move beyond merely returning to an unsatisfying career and instead focus on "living your true best life," which might involve a completely different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Taking Action

It is crucial to take action if you find yourself in a dissatisfying situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Don't tolerate bad work cultures, toxic bosses, poor pay, or unaligned industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Staying in a bad situation only makes it harder to change later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Without a definitive plan and action, dissatisfaction will continue perpetually, making the prospect of working for 10, 20, or 30 more years in an unpassionate role "absolutely awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

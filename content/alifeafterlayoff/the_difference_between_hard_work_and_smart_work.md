Many people believe that working long, hard hours is the key to career advancement and promotion. However, this is a common misconception and a career mistake that many learn the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The reality is that promotions are more often a result of working smart, rather than simply working hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Hard Work Doesn't Always Lead to Promotions

Putting in excessive hours and consistently doing hard work might seem like the path to impressing superiors and earning a promotion, but it often only results in the "dangling carrot" of advancement being pushed further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, as the speaker experienced firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. There can be pressure to work long hours, especially if you have an [[identifying_a_workaholic_boss | workaholic boss]], believing it's what's expected for recognition and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

For example, the speaker once worked 12+ hours a day, sometimes coming in on Saturdays, feeling it was necessary to reach the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Despite this effort, the plan for that division shut down about a year and a half after joining, and all the hard work never led to a promotion, only requiring a new job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

The lesson here is to stop working excessive hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## The Power of Smart Work

Promotions are earned by those who "work the smartest," not necessarily those who work the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Working smart involves strategic effort that aligns with organizational goals and ensures visibility:

*   **Focus on Relevant Projects**
    Working smartly means prioritizing projects that are important to your direct boss and, more importantly, your boss's boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. If your efforts are spent on tasks they don't value or notice, your contributions may not be recognized in crucial discussions about promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Highly visible projects are key to getting promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

*   **Self-Advocacy and Visibility**
    A critical component of working smart is letting people know about your achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. You must understand the "rules of the game" and actively participate, rather than passively waiting for promotions to come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This includes advocating for yourself to the right individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Often, the "right person" for promotion decisions is your boss's boss, not just your immediate manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Find ways to become visible to higher-level leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Be Your Own Advocate**
    No one else in the organization will advocate for your career progression as effectively as you can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. To be the "CEO of your career," you must take on multiple roles, including that of your own marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This means actively marketing your effectiveness within your company, department, and job, as well as in the open market during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This advice is especially relevant for those interested in moving up in an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

By focusing on working smartly—prioritizing visible projects, understanding who the key decision-makers are, and advocating for your own accomplishments—you can navigate your career path more effectively and avoid common pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

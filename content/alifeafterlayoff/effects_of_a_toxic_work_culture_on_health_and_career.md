Working in a [[toxic_work_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic work environment]] can be one of the most physically and emotionally draining situations an individual can experience in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Such an environment can "suck the life out of you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, affecting not only the individual but also those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Health Impacts

The stress of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] often follows employees home after work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This can lead to a range of health issues:
*   **Anxiety-related issues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Sleep disturbances** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   **Dread** when facing the work week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   **Physical manifestations of health issues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

The environment can affect individuals mentally and physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Career Impacts

Beyond personal well-being, a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] can significantly hinder one's career trajectory:
*   **Career setbacks** A [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] can set an individual back years in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The personal cost and trade-off for staying in such an environment are not worth it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Feeling like a failure** Employees may be made to feel like a failure in a job they were otherwise effective in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Unstable work environment** Companies with excessive involuntary turnover or constantly shifting targets create an unstable work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Frustrating employment experiences** Moving targets make it difficult to know one's goals, leading to frustrating employment experiences where success is elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Lack of success** When targets are unclear and colleagues work against each other, it's not a situation where an individual can truly be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Insecurity** Tying compensation to an insecure environment with ever-moving targets is an unsustainable way to exist in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Dishonesty** Being surrounded by dishonest leaders or co-workers who fabricate situations or throw others "under the bus" can derail a career instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of trust** Co-workers who go behind one's back to the boss prevent the building of necessary trust, leading to constant worry about being spied on or tattled on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Stigma from gossip** Aligning with gossips can lead to being labeled as a gossiper, a stigma that is hard to remove and can hinder upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Gossip also frequently causes HR issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Impact of bad bosses** A bad boss is one of the quickest reasons people look for new jobs, as people often "quit bosses, not jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. A bad boss can negatively impact work culture very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

If faced with a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]], it's crucial to reflect on whether it's a systematic issue or localized to one person or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. If it's a company-wide issue that cannot be easily resolved, considering an exit strategy and focusing on what's best for one's own career is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

One of the most feared questions job seekers face in an interview is "Why should we hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> Many [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_job_interviews | job seekers make mistakes]] by providing generic answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> which do not tell the interviewer anything specific about the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Why Generic Responses Are Ineffective

Recruiters are looking for specific insights when they ask interview questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. When asked "Why should we hire you?", interviewers aim to understand if the candidate comprehends the specific problem the position is meant to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Generic responses are considered "so generic and fluffy" that they fail to provide this critical information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Everyone believes they can provide these generic qualities, making them unhelpful for differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Common Generic Responses to Avoid

Avoid phrases like:
*   "I'm a team player." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
    > [!NOTE]
    > Giving "110%" is physically impossible and is a common pet peeve for recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   "I'm a fast learner." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
*   "I achieve results." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'll jump into your team and hit the ground running." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

These types of answers, while sounding positive, do not tell the interviewer anything substantive about your capabilities or how you specifically align with the role's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## The Effective Three-Part Formula for "Why Should We Hire You?"

Instead of generic responses, recruiters look for a targeted answer that addresses the company's specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience suggests a three-part formula for answering this common interview question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>:

### 1. Understand the Business Problem
The hiring manager creates a new position to solve a business gap or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This could be replacing someone, or addressing a new business need, project, or skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Your answer needs to demonstrate your understanding of this problem and how you would fit into solving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

To identify the business problem:
*   **Study the Job Description** Pay close attention to the job description, as it highlights the key indicators of what the business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Listen to the Recruiter** During preliminary screens, listen closely to what the recruiter says. They can provide valuable insights and keys to help you sell yourself in later interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### 2. Link Your Past Experiences to the Business Problem
Once you understand the business problem, connect your past experiences and successes to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If the company is looking for someone to handle a specific project, highlight how you've successfully managed similar projects before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This demonstrates a track record of success in solving similar issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 3. Show How You Can Solve Their Specific Problem
Conclude by explaining how you would apply your experience to solve *their* current business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Provide specific examples of how you would approach the task or project, allowing the interviewer to envision you successfully performing the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

By tying your past business results to the interviewer's specific business problem, you effectively answer why you should be hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

[[the_great_resignation | The Great Resignation]] is a phenomenon where people are voluntarily leaving their jobs en masse as a result of global events over the past 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This trend is considered a legitimate phenomenon that many people are experiencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

Microsoft's research indicates that up to 41% of currently employed individuals plan to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. According to the U.S. Labor Department, a record four million people voluntarily quit their jobs in April 2021, marking the start of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This statistic is particularly startling given the uncertain labor market in April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to [[the_great_resignation | The Great Resignation]]

Several factors have led to this wave of voluntary departures:

*   **Re-evaluation of Life and Work** People began to perceive their lives differently, recognizing the significant amount of time spent commuting and in traditional office settings that might not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting Perceptions of Remote Work** Prior to the pandemic, remote work often carried a stigma, suggesting a lack of dedication or team involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. However, the forced transition to remote work in 2020 demonstrated that many positions, particularly white-collar professional roles, can be effectively done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of School Closures** Unexpected school shutdowns and the need for homeschooling required major sacrifices for many employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, highlighting the importance of flexible employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Returning to Office** After experiencing remote work, many question the necessity of returning to a physical office, especially when there's no valid business reason, and some leaders are pushing for it merely "because they said so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   **Geographic Pay Discrepancies** Employees find it unfair that their pay might be reduced if they move to a lower cost-of-living area while performing the same remote job, especially when companies save on office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Workload and [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | Digital Burnout]]** Some companies "overcorrected" with layoffs during the pandemic, anticipating greater business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. When the market recovered faster than expected, the remaining employees absorbed significant extra work, leading to exhaustion and "digital burnout" from constant online meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **General [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | Job Dissatisfaction]]** A majority of people surveyed expressed being employed but actively considering a move, suggesting widespread [[employee_dissatisfaction_and_career_changes | dissatisfaction with current jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Many professionals with strong career paths are simply not satisfied and are unwilling to tolerate antiquated business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of the great resignation on employment | Impact on Employment and Companies]]

[[the_great_resignation | The Great Resignation]] has created a "buyer's market" for employees, with many open positions and fewer people to fill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

Companies that maintain rigid philosophies on return-to-office and remote work are expected to struggle with competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. Remote work, flexibility, and [[work-life_balance_strategies | work-life balance]] are no longer mere competitive advantages but are becoming standard expectations; companies not offering them will be at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Job seekers are increasingly prioritizing remote opportunities and work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Workforce Landscape

To stay competitive in the labor market, companies must adapt to this new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>:

*   **Prioritize Employee Experience** Organizations need to shape how people work and live, focusing on productivity, flexibility, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:43]</a>.
*   **Offer Flexibility** Flexible work arrangements are becoming crucial, alongside competitive salaries and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.
*   **Provide Career Paths** Employees are less willing to remain in low-level, menial jobs without clear opportunities for advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
*   **Promote Work-Life Balance** There's a growing unwillingness among employees to work excessive hours (e.g., 60-70 hours per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.
*   **Offer Full-Time Employment** Many are seeking stable, full-time positions rather than contract roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

People are also increasingly making significant [[career_dissatisfaction_and_changes | career changes]], completely shifting their professional paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. This redefinition of priorities within the workforce is seen as a positive development that will compel companies to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.

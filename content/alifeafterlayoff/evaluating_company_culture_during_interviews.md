Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, particularly when facing low-quality employers asking suspicious questions that might reveal ulterior motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, employers often provide "tells" or [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews|red flags]] that can indicate a low-quality opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. By paying close attention to certain questions, job seekers can discern potential issues and decide whether to withdraw their candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags in Interviewer Questions

When interviewers ask questions that seem off-putting or off-center, it's crucial to listen carefully, as these can indicate a low-quality employer and suggest that avoiding the opportunity altogether might be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
While seemingly innocent, this question can reveal an employer's [[Assessing organizational culture during job interviews|company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. A strong focus on attendance issues often indicates past problems and an overly particular approach to attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It can imply the employer believes the candidate will be an attendance problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and suggests a lack of flexibility in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. A healthy [[company_culture_and_worklife_balance|workplace]] should allow employees to take sick days without repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. If this question is asked, it's advisable to inquire about the employer's expectations for unplanned absences; if they indicate a strict crackdown, it could signal a toxic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:03:05]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
This question indicates that the employer is primarily seeking to pay the lowest possible amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It suggests a lack of flexibility in compensation and implies that future raises or promotions will likely involve similar attempts to lowball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This approach makes it difficult for employees to maintain a competitive salary in the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
This question is a strong indicator of a turnover issue within the company or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It prompts the candidate to wonder why people are leaving so quickly that such a commitment is necessary to assess in an [[interview feedback|interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This type of question often stems from an employer's bias or points to a larger [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value|cultural problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### "Have you ever been fired?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
An applicant's past employment status is generally not relevant to their ability to perform the current job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Past performance is not always the best indicator of future performance, as a termination might have been due to a poor situation rather than the individual's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If asked, a candidate can redirect the question to focus on future abilities and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Persistent probing after redirection could be a reason to withdraw candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Accusations of Exaggerating or Embellishing Your Resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
Assuming the resume is truthful, an interviewer accusing a candidate of exaggeration suggests a fundamental lack of trust from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This indicates a toxic employer who either believes the candidate is lying or assumes everyone is lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Such an accusation is a significant indicator of a negative [[impact_of_company_culture_on_employee_satisfaction|company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>
This is considered a "trap question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While the interviewer might intend to assess how a candidate overcomes adversity, there are better ways to phrase such a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Focusing on failures can lead to bias, as employers might use the answer against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It's more productive to discuss successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. If answering, candidates should quickly address the failure and shift focus to how they overcame it, making it a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Questions About Availability for Off-Shifts, Weekends, or On-Site Work for Remote Roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>
If an hourly role interviewer asks about availability on off-shifts or weekends, it often indicates a likelihood of forced overtime, suggesting an imbalance in [[company_culture_and_worklife_balance|work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Similarly, for remote positions, questions about coming on-site regularly imply it's not a truly remote job but a hybrid one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If a "fully remote" job is pitched but it's actually hybrid, there's a high chance it will eventually become 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This is a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews|red flag]] for those seeking remote-first positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. It's important to push back for clear expectations on actual work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
This question immediately raises concerns about the workplace environment, suggesting the candidate might be working with difficult or rude individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If the rudeness originates from a manager, it's a major [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews|red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This question directly indicates a deeper [[impact_of_workplace_culture_on_job_satisfaction|cultural issue]] within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Lack of Opportunity for Candidate Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
A significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews|red flag]] is when the interviewer dominates the conversation and does not provide an opportunity for the candidate to ask their own questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This signals that the employer views the interview as a one-sided assessment, forgetting that it's a two-way street where the candidate should also be [[Assessing Company and Role Fit|assessing the interviewer and the company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. If an interviewer takes offense to a candidate asking questions professionally, it indicates an employer who feels they are "above" being assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This attitude reflects a potentially undesirable [[Comparisons of Amazon corporate culture to startups|company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Conclusion
While one or two of these questions alone may not definitively classify a company as poor quality, they serve as crucial data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. They indicate potential deeper [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value|cultural issues]] that warrant further probing through thoughtful questions from the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It's essential to use these [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews|red flags]] to inform probing questions and ensure a full understanding of what you're getting into before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

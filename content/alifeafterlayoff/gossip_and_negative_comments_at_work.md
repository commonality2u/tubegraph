Being careful about what is said in the workplace is crucial, as [[consequences_of_oversharing_at_work | loose lips can lead to trouble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A former HR professional compiled a list of common issues that arise from oversharing with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. To maintain employment and professionalism, there are several [[things_not_to_say_to_coworkers | topics to avoid discussing]] with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Topics to Avoid Discussing with Co-workers

### Your Job Search
Disclosing that you are actively seeking new employment can lead to office whispers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This information can reach your boss, senior leaders, or the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, potentially accelerating your departure from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It is also advised to be cautious when updating resumes online (e.g., Indeed, LinkedIn) to avoid your current employer finding out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Negative Comments About Your Boss
Even when feeling frustrated or confiding in a perceived work ally, speaking negatively about your boss can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Such comments tend to find their way back to management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Gossiping About Co-workers
[[Impact of office gossip | Gossiping about other co-workers]] can damage your reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If others discover you are talking about them behind their backs, they may file a complaint with management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, drawing unwanted attention to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This behavior contributes to [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace dynamics]] and makes [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | dealing with dishonest coworkers]] more challenging.

### Your Salary
While salary transparency is generally positive for leveling the playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, discussing specific salaries within your current company is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This can lead to colleagues feeling underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, potentially causing them to quit or demand higher compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Such discussions can lead management to view you as untrustworthy, hindering future promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. If you wish to share salary information, it is best done anonymously on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Borrowing Money from Co-workers
Borrowing money from colleagues can create sticky situations and often ends poorly for the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Asking for money can also make the co-worker uncomfortable, potentially leading them to report the incident to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Complimenting Physical Attributes
Complimenting a co-worker's physical appearance, even if intended innocently, can be misinterpreted and make the recipient uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It is how the compliment is perceived, not the intention, that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While general compliments on professional aspects like a new hairstyle are acceptable, they should remain professional and brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Asking If Someone Is Pregnant
Never assume or ask a co-worker if they are pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The two likely outcomes are that they are pregnant but not ready to disclose it, or they are not pregnant at all, leading to offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Allow individuals to disclose such personal information when they are ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Discussing Lawsuits Against the Company
If you are involved in or planning litigation against the company, do not discuss it with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Sharing details about your case or the company's alleged wrongdoings can lead to the company taking proactive defensive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This information should only be shared with your attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Telling Off-Color Jokes
Avoid telling off-color jokes at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. What one person considers innocent, another may find offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The impact is determined by the recipient's perception, not the speaker's intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Stick to benign "dad jokes" or minimize jokes altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Political Topics
In today's workplace, it is best to avoid discussing politics, regardless of your stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Political discussions are often hot-button issues that can offend others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> and inevitably lead to arguments without convincing anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Conclusion
Treating co-workers with a high degree of professionalism is key to protecting your career and avoiding legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Being friendly is acceptable, but extreme caution should be exercised regarding what is said and disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This guidance contributes to a healthier work environment, reducing the likelihood of [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic workplace dynamics]] or [[recognizing_a_toxic_work_culture | toxic work culture]].

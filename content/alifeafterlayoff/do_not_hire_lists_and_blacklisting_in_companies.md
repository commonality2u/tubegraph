Being unable to secure an interview or re-hire with a company, particularly a former employer, can lead to the suspicion of being blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon is real, with companies like Meta confirming they maintain block lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Meta's Block Lists for Former Employees

An expose by Business Insider revealed that former Meta employees discovered they were blocked from re-hire, appearing on "do not hire" lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### How Discovery Occurred

The article highlighted a senior engineer impacted by Meta's 2022 layoffs, which were initially considered business decisions, not performance-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This engineer had strong performance ratings ("exceeding expectations") and had recently been promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite multiple hiring managers wanting to re-hire them, the engineer noticed a pattern of being ghosted by recruiters after screening calls were set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

The engineer eventually learned from a hiring manager that the recruiting team had deemed them "ineligible for rehire," or "scarlet lettered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This was the first indication of being on such a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

Other former employees discovered their blacklisting through third-party headhunting agencies. Recruiters would excitedly present candidates to Meta, only for the company to inform them the candidate was on a "do not hire list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Meta's Internal Systems

Meta maintains internal lists to bar some former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. These lists utilize multiple systems to track re-hire ineligibility, including:
*   "Non-regrettable attrition designation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
*   "Do not hire flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

Most companies track rehire information within their HRIS (Human Resources Information System), where employment data is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Recruiters often cannot directly see these flags but must consult HR for a "thumbs up or thumbs down" on rehire candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Criteria for Blacklisting

Meta's official spokesperson claims there is "clear criteria" for being marked ineligible, based on the reason for separation, last ratings, and other performance signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Common reasons to be put on a "do not hire" list include:
*   Violating workplace policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
*   Stealing confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   Quitting abruptly or "rage quitting" without notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>

However, former managers reported that managers had "broad discretion" to add names to this list without documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. If a manager disliked an employee, it was easy to add them to the list, with the decision effectively becoming "gospel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Once an employee is marked as "non-regrettable attrition," this status is permanently recorded in their employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This makes it impossible to "slide back in" even if previous managers are no longer with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Impact on Candidates

Candidates on a "do not hire" list often experience smooth initial communication with recruiters, which then significantly slows down or ceases after deeper engagement with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. They receive vague answers or random rejection letters without a clear reason, even if they seemingly did nothing wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Meta also shifted its layoff messaging from "business decisions" to "performance-based," effectively "scarlet lettered" those laid off, implying they were poor performers ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This creates bias from hiring managers in the broader industry against Meta's former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Informal Blacklisting for Non-Former Employees

Blacklisting can also occur for individuals who have never worked at a company, though it is more ambiguous and informal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Excessive Applications

Applying for the same job repeatedly or applying for many different, unrelated jobs at one company (e.g., 30-40 applications) can lead to an informal blacklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Staffing teams and hiring managers may view extensive application activity or a history of rejections from other teams as a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]], leading to bias against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Applying for every job available can appear "spammy," especially if the roles are unrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

### Failed Interview Processes

Companies like Amazon have "disposition statuses" for candidates who go through interview "loops" but are unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. These may come with a "recycle period," allowing the candidate to reapply for a different role after a set time (e.g., six months for lacking a technical skill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. However, if a candidate fails on "leadership principles" (behavior-based interviews), there is often "no recycling," effectively banning them permanently from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Backdoor References

A "backdoor reference" is when a hiring team member contacts someone they know at a candidate's previous company to get an informal opinion on the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. These references happen behind the scenes and can "sink" a candidate's chances, potentially leading to blacklisting altogether, especially in small industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This is an example of [[common_mistakes_in_the_hiring_process | common mistakes in the hiring process]] from the employer's side or [[hidden_job_requirements in recruitment | hidden job requirements]].

## Conclusion

While "do not hire" lists and blacklisting exist, they are not believed to be a widespread practice across all industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Individuals are encouraged to focus on reclaiming control over their careers rather than being at the mercy of employers with such policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

Interviewing for a new role can be a complex process, and how you articulate your reasons for leaving a previous job is critical. It's important to be strategic and avoid common pitfalls that can lead to negative impressions with recruiters and hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Don't Reveal the "Real" Reason (Without Care)

While it's not suggested to lie, you should carefully package and message the reasons for your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Employers will often judge you based on these explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

*   **Badmouthing a Boss or Company**
    *   **What to avoid**: Saying things like "my boss was terrible," "I didn't like working for them," or "the company treated me poorly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Employer's interpretation**: They might hear that you are difficult to work with, or could potentially become a problem for their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Expressing Boredom**
    *   **What to avoid**: Stating that you were "feeling very bored" or "the job didn't challenge you very much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   **Employer's interpretation**: A hiring manager might conclude that if you were a true "go-getter," you would have found more interesting work to enrich your previous job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This feedback has been heard by recruiters hiring thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

**Recommendation**: Figure out the true reason for your departure and articulate it in a way that doesn't seem threatening to a prospective employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Don't Overshare Career Plans

When asked about your career plans, such as "where do you see yourself in five years," employers are looking for commitment to the career path, long-term interest, and the ability to grow within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

*   **What to avoid**: Stating that your five-year plan is to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Employer's interpretation**: This generally isn't viewed positively and can be a deal breaker, as it suggests you lack passion for the work you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Convey a level of passion for the work you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. If you do have plans for a career shift, ensure you have an idea of how to message this carefully in your interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Don't Reveal Desperation

Even if you're in a situation where you were laid off or fired and have an urgent need for a paycheck, you should avoid revealing this desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Employer's interpretation**: An employer will hear that you are desperate, which can push the desired outcome further away, similar to the dating world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Convey a calm and collected demeanor, appearing as a "cool customer," to avoid being put into the "no" bucket for being overly eager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

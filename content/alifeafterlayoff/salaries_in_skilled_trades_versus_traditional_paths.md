## Traditional Paths and Unexpected Salary Lows

Some roles, despite requiring significant education, high responsibility, or being critical to public service, exhibit surprisingly low salaries, contributing to [[income_disparities_among_various_professions | income disparities among various professions]] and potentially [[disenchantment_with_traditional_career_paths | disenchantment with traditional career paths]].

*   **Research (Master's Degree Holder)**: A researcher working with brain cells, HIV, cocaine, and fentanyl reported earning $29,500 per year, or $14 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*   **Air Ambulance Pilot**: An air ambulance (life flight) pilot reported making $80,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This was considered "shockingly low" for a pilot, especially one in a critical medical role, as the medical industry generally pays low unless one is a doctor or physician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Air Traffic Controller**: Claiming around $100,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

An advanced EMT with 20 years of experience in Tennessee was reportedly making only $10.50 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This is highlighted as a significant disparity given that these individuals are "saving lives" and are "first-line defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Aircraft Cleaner**: Making $17 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. While the job includes a "sweet perk" of free flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, the low wage may limit its usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

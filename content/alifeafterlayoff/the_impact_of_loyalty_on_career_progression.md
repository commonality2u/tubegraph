## Career Mistakes Learned the Hard Way

Everyone is likely to make career mistakes, and these lessons are often learned through difficult experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A significant mistake, often not realized until much later in a career, is making a critical error early on without recognizing its impact until years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This could involve [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | staying too long in a job]], missing out on job opportunities, or accepting a role that wasn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Many individuals later discover they focused too long on a specific job type or career vertical, only to realize it wasn't fulfilling, making a change much harder later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Career coaches often identify early career decisions as the point where a career went "off the rails" when clients express dissatisfaction with their progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Loyalty Rarely Pays Off

A major lesson often learned the hard way is that [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | loyalty rarely pays off]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. One common mistake is [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | staying in a role for too long]] due to loyalty to a leader or an organization, under the belief that "paying dues" will eventually lead to advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. However, this often results in a "dangling carrot" that never materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Staying too long can lead to the market moving past an individual, leaving them behind their peers in terms of leadership roles, responsibility, level, and [[understanding_the_impact_of_salary_and_benefits_on_career_growth | compensation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This misplaced loyalty can significantly hinder [[importance_of_career_progression_and_fair_compensation | career progression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Hard Work vs. Smart Work

Another extension of this lesson is that hard work alone does not guarantee promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Putting in long hours and paying dues, especially under a workaholic boss, might not lead to recognition or promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The key is not to work the most hours, but to work the smartest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Working smartly means focusing on highly visible projects that are important to senior leadership (your boss's boss), not just your direct manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Self-advocacy and marketing one's effectiveness within the company are crucial for [[strategies_for_proactive_career_advancement | moving up in an organization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### The Ever-Changing Value of Skills

While being skilled in a specific area can be an advantage, [[market_trends_and_career_progression | relevant skills matter more]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Employers value certain skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This means skills that were highly valued by one employer or industry might not be transferable or relevant elsewhere, potentially leading to a resume full of outdated skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This can cause individuals to get stuck or settle for jobs beneath their potential, creating a chain of low-quality roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The focus should be on developing relevant skills that are highly in demand by multiple employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### "What Have You Done for Me Lately?"

The painful reality, especially evident during periods of layoffs, is that an employee is often only as good as their most recent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Goodwill built up from past major projects is typically very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. If an employer feels an individual is no longer contributing or cannot contribute in the future, past loyalty or contributions hold little weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This "cold and cutthroat" approach by senior leaders, who prioritize future production, explains why employees baffled by layoffs often held a strong sense of [[changes_in_employeremployee_loyalty | loyalty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Be the CEO of Your Career

To navigate these challenges, individuals must act as the "free agent" of their own career, prioritizing themselves first and the employer second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This involves wearing multiple hats, including acting as one's own marketing department to showcase effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This proactive approach allows individuals to [[strategies_for_proactive_career_advancement | reclaim control]] and take ownership of their [[changing_perspectives_on_career_loyalty_and_stability | career with strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

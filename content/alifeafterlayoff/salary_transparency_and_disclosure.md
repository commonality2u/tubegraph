This article explores various self-reported salaries and the concept of [[understanding_salary_transparency | salary transparency]], offering insights into different career paths and their potential earnings based on anecdotal data from online sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Importance of Salary Transparency

[[understanding_salary_transparency | Salary transparency]] is highlighted as a way to increase equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For job seekers, knowing potential earnings can help in career planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Data Reliability

The salary data discussed is primarily [[selfreported_salary_data_and_reliability | self-reported salary data]] from Reddit, which is described as "the wild west of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Therefore, it should be taken "with a bit of a grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Efforts were made to filter positions seemingly from North America, specifically the United States, and those that appeared legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Self-Reported Salary Examples

Below are various roles with their self-reported earnings, along with details on job responsibilities and environments:

### Bridge Operator
A bridge operator reported earning $35,000 to $40,000 annually, depending on overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This income allows them to pay bills, live comfortably, and do what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While not "big bucks," the position offers great benefits and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Much of the time is spent indoors, away from the elements, often engaged in leisure activities like playing Xbox, watching TV, taking naps, or reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. They can go hours without seeing a boat, though sometimes it can be busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The job is described as "pretty chill" due to 12-hour shifts alone without a boss present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Union Journeyman Plumber and Pipefitter
A union journeyman plumber and pipefitter reportedly earns $46.33 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This is a union job, so union dues apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Skilled trades, such as plumbers, electricians, or carpenters, can generate significant income, especially when self-employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. For example, a local plumber reportedly charges no less than $300 per house call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Jet Engine Builder
Someone who builds jet engines claims to make $43.13 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This translates to roughly $90,000 per year without overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The work is considered highly skilled, as incorrect assembly could lead to catastrophic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Software Sales
A software sales professional reported a base salary of $110,000 with a potential bonus of around $110,000, leading to a total compensation of approximately $220,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Commissions in software sales, particularly in Software as a Service (SaaS), can be very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Dental Assistant
A dental assistant claimed an hourly wage of $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This equates to about $62,500 annually before overtime, and potentially $70,000 to $75,000 with overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This income is noted as good given that dental school is not required for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Car Sales
Earnings in car sales can range widely from $30,000 to $120,000 per year, depending on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The market conditions, such as car shortages, can affect income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Software Engineer
A software engineer reported making $133,000 a year, not including bonuses or discounted stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This base salary is considered relatively low for a seasoned engineer, who might expect $150,000 to $170,000 at a reasonably sized company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Total compensation could be much higher due to stock incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

This individual reported earning between $25 and $50 per hour, averaging $75,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The job offers a relaxed dress code, flexible hours, no stress, and a feeling that it's not "work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While benefits are self-funded, the lifestyle is attractive for animal lovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Starting one's own business in this field can be lucrative, potentially earning $25-$50 per hour, whereas working for someone else might yield closer to $12 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Working approximately 45 weeks a year at this rate would result in earnings of around $229,000-$230,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This profession is currently high-demand and lucrative, though it can be high-stress and involve frequent travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Railroad Freight Conductor
A railroad freight conductor reported earning $70,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

Challenges of this job include limited positions and significant time spent away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

### Garbage Man
A garbage man reported earning $95,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The shift towards automated trucks with robotic arms reduces the need for multiple workers per truck, raising questions about the future of these jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Last year, they claimed to have made approximately $360,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Minor League Baseball Player
Minor league baseball players earn roughly $2,000 per month for six months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. There is no guarantee of advancing to the major leagues, as the percentage of players who make it is "astronomically small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. It is advised to have a Plan B for this career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### Corporate Development
A person in "corporate development" reported earning $350,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. The exact nature of the role is unclear, but such a high salary would suggest a director or senior director position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Options Investor
An options investor claimed earnings of $125,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. While the "sky's the limit" for traders, there's also significant risk of losing money quickly without proper knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Benefits include healthcare, a pension (rare for modern jobs), and six weeks of paid vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. The high wage and extensive vacation suggest long tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### 9-1-1 Operator
A 9-1-1 operator reported earning $28 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This is considered a reasonable wage for a high-stress job that is not for everyone due to the nature of emergency calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

### Animator (Video Games)
An animator with 16 years of experience in video games reported earning $28 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This is noted as less lucrative than video game bug testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Social Worker

As a recruiter and career coach, it's clear that many resumes need improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While there isn't a single "right" way to write a resume, the ultimate test is whether it achieves the desired results, such as landing job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The advice offered comes from a corporate recruiter's perspective, considering how resumes are screened quickly (often in 5 seconds) and feedback from hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The goal is to capture attention quickly and secure that first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Outdated Templates and ATS Compatibility

One of the most critical steps in [[optimizing_and_customizing_resumes_for_job_applications|resume optimization]] is to stop using outdated templates, particularly those designed by graphic designers found on sites like Canva.com or large industry resume hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Why Avoid Graphic-Heavy Templates?
*   These templates often include graphics, charts, and "cute presentation" elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   They distract from the primary purpose of a resume, which is to allow recruiters to quickly and concisely find the information they are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Graphic-designed templates are typically ineffective because their creators often do not understand how [[job_application_process_and_strategies|applicant tracking systems]] (ATS) parse resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Recommended Template Features
*   **Simplicity:** Opt for a simple template, such as those available in Microsoft Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Column Structure:** Choose a one-column template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Color Scheme:** Avoid bright and flashy colors and graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Basic colors like blue, black, or dark green are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Fonts:** Ensure fonts are clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Overall Aesthetic:** For most professions, a resume should be "relatively boring" in its design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The only exception is if you are a graphic designer or in a creative field where a more creative approach is expected, though even then, using a template designed by another graphic designer might not be the best representation of your own skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Contact Information Formatting for ATS

A crucial tip for ATS compatibility is to format your contact information vertically instead of horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. ATS typically struggles to read and parse horizontal information effectively, leading to errors in data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Testing ATS Compliance
*   If you find yourself frequently performing manual data entry for your name, phone number, or address when applying for jobs, it's a strong indicator that your resume is not ATS-compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   While incorrect contact information parsing isn't the primary reason for not getting contacted, ensuring it's clean and correctly read can significantly speed up your [[job_application_process_and_strategies|job application process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Content and Language Best Practices

### Profiling vs. Summarizing
Instead of writing your resume as a summary of every accomplishment in your career, focus on "profiling" for a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This means delivering exactly what the employer is looking for, rather than hoping they stumble upon something they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. [[how_to_effectively_convey_information_in_resumes|Focus on what hiring teams actually care about]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Conciseness and Clarity
*   **Avoid Wordiness:** Recruiters and hiring managers often skip resumes with massive blocks of text because they are difficult to scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Be concise and selective with your words, ensuring they lay out clearly on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Proprietary Language:** Do not use proprietary language, project names, or division names that are only understood within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Boil down concepts into clear and common language relevant to the industry you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Remove Generic Terminology:** Phrases like "team player" or "great organizational skills" are generic and make recruiters roll their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Important competencies will be assessed in an interview anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Focus on actionable terms and concepts related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job to get an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Adaptability and Continuous Improvement

### Stop Being Stubborn
If your resume isn't yielding results, don't be stubbornâ€”redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. If you're consistently getting rejected at the application level, your resume is likely not working for you, especially if you believe you are a clear fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Be Realistic About Fit
It's important to be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Take a close look at the job posting and honestly assess if you truly stack up, especially when there are potentially thousands of other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Ensure your resume clearly conveys your fit to maximize your chances of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Plan, Do, Check, Adjust
If your resume isn't getting the results you want, make changes and try a different version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This iterative process of "plan, do, check, and adjust" is key to improving your [[job_application_tips_and_strategies|job searching strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

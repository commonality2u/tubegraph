When seeking a job, candidates are often asked to provide professional references. Recruiters and human resource professionals use these references as a component of the [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | hiring process]] to gain insights into a candidate's past performance and suitability for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## When Are References Checked?

While not all companies require reference checks, they are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Reference checks are generally seen more frequently in [[how_smaller_and_larger_companies_handle_reference_checks | smaller companies]] or with agencies that are submitting candidates to larger corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In these scenarios, the references provided will likely be followed through on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## What Information is Sought from References?

When a reference is contacted, the checker will typically go through a series of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These questions often relate to:
*   The job position being applied for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   The candidate's work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Attendance (especially for hourly positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   Any concerns the employer should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Eligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

A standard form with about three to five questions is often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## [[Challenges and strategies for providing effective references | Challenges in the Reference Check Process]]

One of the [[challenges_and_strategies_for_providing_effective_references | challenges]] faced by recruiters is tracking down references and getting them to return calls, which can [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | delay the hiring process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Liability Concerns in Larger Corporations

Many larger companies are reluctant to provide detailed references due to [[liability_concerns_associated_with_giving_references | liability concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Providing a negative reference, even if truthful, could open the previous employer to claims of slander or legal action if it's perceived to have prevented the candidate from getting a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Human resources professionals prioritize limiting a company's exposure to liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This also extends to limiting feedback during the interview process, often advised by legal teams to be very generic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

As a result, most major corporations:
*   Do not give out references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Instruct their employees, especially those with direct reports, to filter reference calls back to the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   When contacted by another company, HR typically only confirms "name, rank, and serial number" â€“ the individual's name, dates of employment, and job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   They will not disclose compensation, rehire eligibility, or reasons for termination, as this information could be used against the company in an adverse hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Due to these policies, candidates from larger corporations may find that their references have less luck getting detailed feedback than those from [[how_smaller_and_larger_companies_handle_reference_checks | smaller companies]], which may not be as stringent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## [[Best practices for selecting and notifying references | Best Practices for Providing References]]

If you are asked to provide references, take the request seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Here are key [[best_practices_for_selecting_and_notifying_references | best practices]]:

1.  **Select Legitimate and Relevant References**:
    *   Aim for at least one direct manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   Three managers are ideal for the most valid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   If you can't provide all managers, include someone you directly supported, such as a customer (internal or external) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Avoid peers doing the same job as you; their reference is less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Someone one or two levels above you who can speak to your performance is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

2.  **Ensure a Positive Reference**:
    *   Only provide references from individuals who will give you a good recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   A negative reference can complicate the hiring decision for the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Reflect on who you have strong working relationships with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

3.  **Obtain Permission and Inform Your References**:
    *   Always ask for permission before listing someone as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Inform them that you are interviewing and that they might receive a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   Pre-notifying references helps ensure they take the call and do not mistake it for spam, preventing delays in the [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | hiring process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Importance of References in the Final Stages

For many employers, especially major ones, reference checks are often a final "check-off" rather than a heavily weighted factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. As long as the manager gives a decent reference indicating they would work with you again, it's usually sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Reaching the reference check stage typically means an offer is likely to be extended soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The start of 2024 has been challenging for job seekers, with widespread layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, which are now extending to other industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A common justification for these layoffs is an increased investment in [[impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_employment | Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. What was once speculation about AI taking over jobs is now a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Evidence of AI-Driven Layoffs

Several companies are reducing their workforce, with AI being a significant underlying factor:

*   **Cisco Systems** announced a major layoff on February 14th, affecting 5% of their global workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The company plans to shift its focus to key priority areas like [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_job_market_changes | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. CEO Chuck Robbins stated they would align investments with future growth opportunities, particularly as customers adopt AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   A Yahoo Finance article indicates that AI is a major reason companies are laying people off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Analysts suggest that more companies will double down on AI investment to improve productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Google** laid off hundreds in their ads division in January due to a switch to AI-powered sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Generative AI features, including natural language chatbots, are making customer service and sales roles redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Previously, humans provided sales guidance, but AI can now perform these tasks thousands of times a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **IBM** announced a hiring freeze in May 2023, with plans to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI, primarily in back-office functions like Human Resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Thirty percent of non-customer-facing roles (e.g., finance, accounting, HR) are expected to be affected over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   A CEO in India replaced 90% of support staff with AI chatbots, citing increased efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   A survey by Resume Builder found that 44% of companies anticipate AI replacing employees in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   An article from last year noted that AI eliminated nearly 4,000 jobs as businesses rapidly adopted advanced AI technology to automate tasks like creative work, writing, administrative, and clerical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The AI industry is projected to grow to over $1 trillion, fueled by advances like the launch of ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Roles Most Susceptible to AI Displacement

AI is particularly adept at tasks involving data entry, administrative duties, and standardized processes. This poses a significant threat to various job categories:

*   **Clerical and Administrative Roles**: Bots are already proficient at generating Human Resources letters, boilerplate text, and some advertising copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This means junior and mid-level workers in these areas are especially vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Creative and Writing Professions**: While humans still do ad campaigns, AI-powered tools can create photorealistic portraits and ad content from simple prompts, negating the need for models, permits, or usage rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This raises concerns for photographers and graphic designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Customer Service**: Chatbots are already taking over online customer service roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, making it harder for consumers to speak with a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Legal Industry**: Tasks like whipping up standard legal documents or serving as a paralegal or legal assistant can be done very efficiently by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. There is even an AI-powered robot lawyer that can represent a defendant in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Technology Jobs**: This includes coding, computer programming, software engineering, and data analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. AI tools can produce good, clean code efficiently and accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Media Jobs**: This encompasses advertising, content creation, technical writing, and journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Many publications are already laying off editorial staff in favor of AI-driven content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Market Research Analysts**: AI is highly effective at quickly analyzing and compiling large datasets into usable formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Teachers**: ChatGPT can already teach classes, and some educators use it for lesson planning and grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Financial Jobs**: Financial analysts, personal financial advisors, accounting roles, and even traders are at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. AI can analyze trends, predict market movements, and execute investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Recruitment**: The [[role_of_ai_in_the_recruitment_process | role of AI in the recruitment process]] is also expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. AI robots can scan resumes and make analytical decisions, which may lack the human ability to interpret transferable skills or consider career changers, potentially making it harder for many to get hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

<h5>The Reality of AI Automation</h5>
<p>Mi here Shuka, CEO of Automation Anywhere, predicted at Davos that 15% to 70% of work done in front of a computer could be automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. While AI claims it will "assist" and "improve" jobs by automating mundane tasks, companies are prioritizing cost savings over creativity, leading to job replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.</p>

*   **Develop New Skills and Niche Areas**: Seek out roles or specialize in areas that are not easily replaceable by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Regularly check job postings for common trends in skills or tech stacks that are in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI to Your Advantage**: Become proficient in using AI tools within your job. Figuring out how to leverage AI to make yourself more efficient can be a valuable proposition for your role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

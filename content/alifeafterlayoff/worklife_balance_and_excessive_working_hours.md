The lack of [[importance_of_worklife_balance | work-life balance]], especially due to excessive working hours, is a significant sign of a [[effects_of_working_in_a_harmful_environment | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This issue often stems from companies or bosses who pride themselves on requiring employees to work excessive hours to complete tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Identifying Excessive Working Hours
Most jobs should be performed satisfactorily within 40 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. If an employee is routinely expected to work 60-plus hours a week, it indicates that the company is either understaffed, overworking its employees, or a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

While some industries have a culture of excessive hours, it's crucial to assess if this aligns with personal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. A [[dealing_with_a_workaholic_boss | toxic boss]] might also value "face time" over actual productive work, leading to unnecessary long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. A good boss will not routinely call employees on nights, weekends, or during vacation for updates that can wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Impacts of Poor Work-Life Balance
Working in an environment with a severe lack of [[importance_of_worklife_balance | work-life balance]] can be one of the most physically and emotionally draining career situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It can "suck the life" out of an individual and negatively affect those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Symptoms of this [[workplace_burnout_and_its_effects | workplace burnout]] include:
*   Anxiety-related issues, even after work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Difficulty sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Dreading going to work, especially on Monday mornings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Mental and physical health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Feeling like a failure, even if previously effective in a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Career setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

## Considerations and Solutions
While occasional long hours for specific projects may be necessary, routinely working excessive hours as a normal part of the work culture points to a [[effects_of_working_in_a_harmful_environment | toxic environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

More and more individuals are demanding a [[importance_of_worklife_balance | work-life balance]] as a key consideration when accepting a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This is because time and personal memories lost due to overwork cannot be regained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

If routinely expected to work 60+ hours a week, it's important to evaluate if the job is the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's crucial to take proactive steps and look out for one's own career best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

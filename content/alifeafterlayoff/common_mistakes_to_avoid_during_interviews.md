When approaching a job interview, it's crucial to understand not only what to say but also what to avoid. Certain pitfalls can derail your chances, particularly when answering common questions like "Tell me about yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter, HR professional, career coach, and hiring manager shares insights into [[common_interview_mistakes | common interview mistakes]] to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Why "Tell Me About Yourself" Is Asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>

The question "Tell me about yourself" often causes anxiety due to its ambiguous nature, presenting a "blank canvas" for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. While it might seem like an icebreaker, it's a strategic opportunity to demonstrate your suitability for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Hiring managers typically don't have a strict agenda for this question but are looking to ascertain two key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>:
*   Whether the candidate possesses the necessary competency to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   More importantly, if they are a good motivational fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

This initial question is your chance to shine and set a positive tone for the rest of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## [[common_interview_mistakes | Common Mistakes to Avoid]] When Introducing Yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>

When answering "Tell me about yourself" or introducing yourself, steer clear of these [[common_interview_mistakes | common interview mistakes]]:

### Don't Rehash Your Resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>
The interviewer has already reviewed your resume, and the purpose of this question is not a line-by-line recitation of your past job duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Specific questions about your background will follow later in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Don't Give a Life Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>
Stick to the script and keep your answer relevant to the position you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Avoid delving into personal history such as overcoming childhood adversity, adventures abroad, or hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Don't Ramble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>
Conciseness is key. Aim for an answer between three to five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Long-winded answers can be detrimental and are a quick way to be placed in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. If you find yourself rambling, cut to the chase and wrap up your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Don't Highlight Irrelevant Information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>
Focus solely on aspects directly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. For example, skip details about a side hustle (e.g., as a personal trainer) and instead emphasize why you are a great fit and particularly interested in *this specific* position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Preparation is key!
> Before your interview, carefully read the job description and identify key areas of interest for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Tailor your answer to focus on how your strengths align with the job and the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Also, articulate why you are interested in the position, linking it to your long-term career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Show genuine interest and explain how this role represents a valuable challenge and a logical next step in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

While having a concise, summarized way to present your experience is important, avoid sounding robotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Speak in your own voice to maintain authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

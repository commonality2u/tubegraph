Interview questions about salary can be a significant hurdle in your job search, acting as a "trap" if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The way you discuss salary expectations can lead to a lower offer or leave money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Conversely, stating too high an expectation might deter employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Understanding the "Trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>

The question "What's your current salary?" or "What are your salary expectations?" is often included in a list of common interview traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Its purpose can be to anchor you to a lower offer, potentially resulting in you leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Handling "What's Your Current Salary?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

Some states prohibit the question about your current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. If this question comes up, it's advised to deflect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Instead, focus on the value of the role itself and shift the focus back to the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Answering "What are Your Salary Expectations?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>

When asked about your [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_an_interview | salary expectation]], a strategic approach is key:
1.  **Ask Them First** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>: Initially, ask the interviewer if they can share the salary range for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
2.  **Provide a Range** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>: If they insist on you providing a number first, state your "minimum acceptable salary" and then add 10% to 20% above that to form a range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Your minimum acceptable salary is defined as the amount you would need to feel genuinely positive about the offer and not immediately continue your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Preparation is Key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

Before the interview, conduct thorough [[factors_influencing_salary_decisions_in_job_offers | salary research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. It's also crucial to be realistic about your true skills and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Reclaiming Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

The goal is to reclaim control over your career and not allow the company to solely determine your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. If a company attempts to lowball you, be prepared to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Avoiding the Question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>

Attempting to avoid answering the salary expectation question can lead to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Employers may reject you or place you in a "limbo" status until a number is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Companies are reluctant to invest time with hiring teams and executives if there's a significant disparity in [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Similarly, you don't want to go through an entire interview process only to find out the company's offer is much lower than your expectations, as it wastes your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

A corporate recruiter with two decades of experience interviewing and hiring thousands of people ranks 15 different ways to look for a job from least to most effective based on personal experience and the goal of getting a job as quickly as possible with the best return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The ranking is subjective, with scores from 1 (least effective) to 10 (most effective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Some methods may favor blue-collar workers, while others are more effective for white-collar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Least Effective Job Search Methods (Score 1-3)

### Cold Calling (Score: 1/10)
Cold calling involves soliciting a job without knowing if the employer has an opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This includes physically dropping in unannounced or sending unsolicited notes on LinkedIn asking for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. As a corporate recruiter, this method almost never works due to the energy spent versus the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Social Media Engagement (Score: 1/10)
Engaging with a company's social media (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) in hopes of getting noticed by a hiring team is very unlikely to yield an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. HR and talent acquisition departments typically do not manage social media accounts; marketing departments usually do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. A recruiter is unlikely to see such engagement, and it's considered a form of cold calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Job Fairs (Score: 2/10)
Job fairs can be effective, particularly for blue-collar roles or entry-level university students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, from an employer's perspective, finding a well-qualified candidate is slim, and job seekers face stiff competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They are not considered the best targeted way to look for a job, especially if seeking quick employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Industry Events / In-Person [[importance_of_networking_in_job_searching | Networking]] (Score: 3/10)
Similar to job fairs, industry events or networking mixers are generally untargeted for immediate job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While awkward small talk might lead to long-term contacts and potential future opportunities, it's not the best use of time for quick job attainment, especially for introverts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Online Forums (Score: 3/10)
Online forums, including tech forums or LinkedIn groups, are generally not targeted for active recruiting, leading to "feeding frenzies" when opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. However, recruiters might find individuals who demonstrate expertise and engage in the community, making it a way for recruiters to discover passive candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. It's not ideal for [[job_searching_while_employed | quick job searching]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Professional Associations (Score: 4/10)
Joining professional associations, like the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), can help brand oneself as an expert, particularly in a specific local labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This method is more geared towards white-collar professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Company Website Direct Application (Score: 5/10)
Applying directly on a company's website ensures the resume is seen by a recruiter and filtered into their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Headhunter or Agency Recruiter (Score: 5/10)
Headhunters or agencies are third parties contracted by employers to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. While they might have multiple roles, opportunities tend to fizzle out quickly if the initial fit isn't there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Job seekers should use agencies as a supplement, not as their sole [[networking_and_job_searching_tips | job search strategy]], as they need to take ownership of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Personal Website / Blog (Score: 5/10)
Setting up a website or blog to brand oneself as an expert is powerful, especially for creative roles (design, photography) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Writing niche content can attract companies interested in specific expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This requires effort and is a longer-term strategy, not yielding immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### [[effective_use_of_job_boards_for_a_fast_job_search | Job Boards]] (Score: 6/10)
Applying through [[effective_use_of_job_boards_for_a_fast_job_search | job boards]] like LinkedIn or Indeed is common, but it means competing with many other applicants, sometimes thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Recruiters fill only a small percentage (5-10%) of their jobs through active [[effective_use_of_job_boards_for_a_fast_job_search | job board]] postings because many candidates are not well-aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Despite the effort and hoops, it's worth doing, as only one offer is needed to become employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Most Effective Job Search Methods (Score 7-10)

### Advertisements (Score: 7/10)
Responding to external advertisements (e.g., billboards, truck signs, "help wanted" signs) is often effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. These indicate a company is actively struggling to find candidates, increasing the chance of a resume being seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This method is more effective for blue-collar roles than white-collar ones, as major corporations rarely use such visible signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Internships or Co-ops (Score: 7/10)
For entry-level candidates, internships or co-ops are powerful ways to land a first job, especially without relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. They provide a significant advantage over competitors, offer a foot in the door, and build goodwill with the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Online [[networking_effectively_on_linkedin | Networking]] (Score: 7/10)
Online [[importance_of_networking_in_job_searching | networking]], typically on platforms like LinkedIn, is less intimidating than in-person events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Targeted online [[importance_of_networking_in_job_searching | networking]] is powerful, but requires proper etiquette to avoid being seen as cold calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. A training course called "Unlocking LinkedIn" teaches effective strategies for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Industry Contacts (Score: 8/10)
Leveraging past working relationships with industry contacts (former bosses or close colleagues) is a powerful way to get a foot in the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. These contacts can often pull individuals into their new organizations, bypassing deep interview processes and securing fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### Employee Referrals (Score: 8/10)
If you know someone working at a target company, seeking an employee referral is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Referrers often receive a bonus, and referred candidates typically get preference over external applicants, frequently skipping to the front of the interview line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

### Outbound Sourcing / [[maximizing_discoverability_for_job_seekers | Maximizing Discoverability]] (Score: 10/10)

Being discovered means being pulled directly to the front of the line, bypassing the extensive application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Understanding how recruiters source candidates is the single best thing a job seeker can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

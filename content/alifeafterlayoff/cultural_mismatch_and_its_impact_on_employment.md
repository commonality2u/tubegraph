## Record Terminations of Gen Z Workers

Recent data indicates that bosses are terminating Gen Z workers at a record pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A survey conducted by Intelligent.com in August involved 966 business leaders engaged in hiring decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The survey revealed that 75% of companies had hired Gen Z, and a significant 60% admitted to firing a recent college graduate within the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Overall, 75% of companies reported at least one issue with their recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

This trend suggests that employers are quick to terminate those they perceive as a [[impact_of_company_culture_on_employee_satisfaction | cultural mismatch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This rapid turnover is expected to continue as generational shifts occur in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

### Key Reasons for Gen Z Firings

The survey highlighted several frequently cited reasons for these terminations, reflecting a significant [[impact_of_workplace_culture_on_job_satisfaction | cultural disconnect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>:

*   **Lack of motivation or initiative**: Cited by 50% of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of professionalism**: Reported by nearly 46% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational skills and communication skills**: Perceived as lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Challenges with feedback**: Gen Z employees are seen as not taking feedback well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of relevant work experience**: An interesting point, as entry-level positions often require experience, creating a [[mismatch_between_job_description_and_reality | disconnect]] between employer expectations and the [[job_market_changes_and_employee_impacts | job market reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Poor problem-solving skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Insufficient technical skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Bad [[impact_of_company_culture_on_employee_satisfaction | culture fit]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Difficulty working in a team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

### Employer Perceptions of Recent College Graduates

Hiring managers hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:

*   **Entitlement**: Around 65-70% believe Gen Z is entitled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, often trying to get promoted too quickly without demonstrated experience or wanting high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Offended easily**: Approximately 65% believe they get offended easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of work ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Unprepared for the workforce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of technological skills**: Surprisingly, 28% cited a lack of technological skills, despite Gen Z growing up with modern devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. This suggests a disconnect between academic preparation and real-world workplace demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Workload management and professionalism**: About 20% state they often can't manage workloads and are unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Punctuality and appearance**: 20% report frequent lateness and not dressing professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Communication**: 19% observed inappropriate language use at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Meeting etiquette**: Often late to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Manageability**: 17% find them difficult to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a> and hand in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Education Disconnect
> Universities and schools are seen as not adequately preparing individuals for success in the modern workplace, leading to a significant [[impact_of_workplace_culture_on_job_satisfaction | cultural disconnect]] and insufficient transition training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This is particularly discouraging given the significant financial investment in college degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Case Studies and Anecdotal Evidence

Real-world examples from social media and comments sections corroborate these survey findings, showcasing behaviors that lead to termination.

### TikTok Cases: Getting Fired

*   **Case 1: Frequent Phone Use and Micromanagement**
    A Gen Z individual shared her experience of being fired from two accounting roles within the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Her first termination was due to excessive phone use in a "boring" role with a "sucky" company culture where colleagues "snitched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Management eventually moved her desk to be directly in front of her manager's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. She expressed disliking being micromanaged and the "high school vibe" of the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Case 2: "All-Star Employee" and Flexible Hours Misunderstanding**
    In her second accounting role, she was fired after an "all-star employee" allegedly badmouthed her to HR, claiming she came in "whenever I felt like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The employee had a contract allowing flexible start times (6-9 AM), but the colleague was unaware of these terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This highlights a need for clear communication of expectations and mirroring team norms, especially early in tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Case 3: Chronic Tardiness and Entitlement**
    Another individual was terminated for consistent tardiness and absenteeism, including multiple instances of clocking in 12 to 32 minutes late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. She even had a "no call, no show" on her birthday, which she felt justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Her inability to recognize the problem and her sense of entitlement were noted as significant red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Case 4: "Quiet Quitting" Revelation**
    One individual was fired because they "didn't do anything for 15 months and they found out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This reflects a "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place" mentality that employers are no longer tolerating, especially in a competitive [[impact_economic_conditions_on_employment_strategies | job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

### Employer Comments and Observations

Feedback from employers in various sectors echoes the survey results:

*   **Construction Company Owner**: Observed that young people under 30 (with few exceptions) are "the most entitled and uneducated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. He cited a lack of communication skills, critical thinking, motivation, and a need for constant supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. A key complaint was their inability to put down phones and focus for more than 10 minutes, leading to short attention spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Emergency Department Supervisor**: Described a new nurse graduate who wouldn't stay off her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and texted friends about patients in the emergency room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. When her phone was confiscated, she had a tantrum and ultimately chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:34">[01:1:34]</a>. This led to the department ceasing to hire new nurse graduates, unfairly impacting motivated individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:54">[01:1:54]</a>.
*   **Government IT Professional**: Reported that computer science graduates hired for entry-level IT admin positions all failed to last more than six months due to issues like lack of focus, poor attention, communication skills, urgency, and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Employer Hesitancy and Future Outlook

Due to these pervasive issues, one in seven companies may not hire any college graduates in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. One out of six hiring managers is already hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, believing a stronger work ethic and better attitude would make them more hirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The "Few Bad Apples" Effect
> It's crucial to acknowledge that this negative perception of Gen Z is often driven by "a few bad apples" rather than the entire generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Many Gen Z individuals are highly motivated, driven, and strategic, eager to succeed in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Recommendations for Gen Z Success

To combat these perceptions and succeed in the workplace, employers are seeking:

*   **Initiative and positive attitudes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
*   **Strong work ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   **Adaptability and openness to feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   **Punctuality and reliability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   **Solid technical and interpersonal skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   **Internship experience**: Actively sought by recruiters in college programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Professional social media presence**: Employers actively check social media to assess [[assessing_organizational_culture_during_job_interviews | culture fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. It's important to separate personal and professional life on social platforms and avoid posting content that could negatively impact one's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Avoiding political topics at work**: Discussing politics can lead to termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Broader Context
> Gen Z is entering the workforce during one of the most challenging [[job_market_changes_and_employee_impacts | job markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, they are also driving positive changes, such as a greater emphasis on [[impact_of_workplace_culture_on_job_satisfaction | work-life balance]], which is a welcome shift in increasingly unhealthy workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. It's also important to remember that every generation has faced similar criticisms upon entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

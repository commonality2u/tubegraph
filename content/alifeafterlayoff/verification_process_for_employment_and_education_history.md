Securing a job offer is exciting, but often it's contingent upon successfully passing a background check. This process involves employers verifying information provided by candidates, particularly their employment and education history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Background Check Process

Job offers are almost always contingent on the successful completion of a background check, and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Employers typically outsource this process to a third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The [[job_application_process_and_strategies | job application]] itself is a legal document, and applicants often certify that all information is correct and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Once hired, the application becomes a permanent part of the employment record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. After signing an offer letter, candidates usually complete another form authorizing the company to conduct [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | employment background checks]], including criminal background checks, employment verification, and potentially drug screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This information is then sent to the third-party company for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

It is crucial that the information verified in the background check matches what was submitted on the [[job_application_process_and_strategies | job application]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Any discrepancy can lead to the withdrawal of the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Employment Verification

Employers use various resources for [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background checks]], including searching databases and directly verifying employment records with current or most recent employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The most common starting point for employment verification is "Work Number," a database where millions of employers submit employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This database can verify not only employment records but sometimes income as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, employers generally do not check previous income, as it is becoming an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

If the information in the database is insufficient, the third-party company may contact the employer directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The main aspects checked during employment verification include:
*   Confirmation of employment at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Dates of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Job titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Most background checks go back roughly seven to ten years, though some companies may check a candidate's entire work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Job Titles and Employment Dates

When it comes to job titles, minor adjustments to make them more commonly accepted in an industry (e.g., "talent acquisition specialist" instead of "recruiter" if they are the same level) are generally not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. However, significant changes, such as claiming a director-level title when you were an individual contributor, would pose major problems and likely be a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | major red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Falsifying employment dates by adding extra months or years of experience is also not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Education Verification

The final common check employers conduct is education verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This verifies that you attended the schools and obtained the degrees you claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

This verification includes:
*   High school attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   Any claimed college degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   Certifications, such as a CPA license if claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

These checks are typically done by contacting the university directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This process is usually quick because universities are accustomed to these inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Consequences of Failing a Background Check or Falsifying Information

If a candidate fails the [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]], the employer receives a detailed report highlighting any discrepancies or unverified information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The employer may then seek further clarification from the candidate or, potentially, withdraw the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. It is in the candidate's best interest to respond proactively to help verify their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Importance of Honesty
> The [[job_application_process_and_strategies | job application]] is a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. [[importance_of_honesty_in_job_applications_and_potential_consequences_of_falsifying_information | Falsifying information]] on a resume or application can lead to a rescinded job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Even after being hired, if an employer discovers discrepancies in credentials, the employee can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It's always advisable to be forthcoming and ensure you have the credentials you claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

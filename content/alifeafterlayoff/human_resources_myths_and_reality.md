The speaker, Brian, has 20 years of experience in [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resources]] functions, specifically in human resource management and recruiting for both large, well-known companies and smaller organizations [00:00:26]. He aims to share his perspective on the true function of [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resources]] within an organization [00:01:26]. While he does not agree with everything [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resources]] does, he identifies as an employee advocate when employees are acting properly [00:01:34]. He notes that the vast majority of [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] professionals are compassionate and believe strongly in doing the right thing and being an employee advocate [00:01:58].

## Common Misconceptions About HR
There is a common misconception that [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resources]] is solely an advocate for employees and is "on their side" [00:01:07]. Many individuals express bitterness, anger, and a jaded view towards the [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] function, often after experiencing an [[impact_of_hr_decisions_on_careers | adverse employment decision]] [00:00:50]. The speaker stresses the importance of self-reflection and taking ownership of one's contribution to such situations, rather than solely blaming [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] [00:04:05].

## The True Hierarchy of HR's Purpose
At its core, the [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resources]] function is a business department, not originally set up solely for people [00:07:36]. The speaker expresses dislike for the term "human resources" itself [00:07:46].

The speaker outlines a hierarchy of purposes for [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]]:

### 1. Primary Purpose: Risk Mitigation and Compliance
The ultimate driving mission of all [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] departments is to mitigate risk, implement risk avoidance, and ensure compliance with legal requirements to keep the company out of legal trouble [00:09:02]. This focus on risk avoidance means that if an [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] department hears something that presents a risk, they are required to act on it to minimize liability [00:17:14].

### 2. Secondary Purpose: Strategic Business Alignment
[[human_resources_and_employee_relations | Human resources]] functions as a strategic business partner to senior leadership, often having closed-door meetings with presidents, CEOs, and executive teams to align with business strategy [00:08:04]. The [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] department's purpose is to align talent with the overall business strategy, ensuring the right people are in place to achieve the executive team's goals [00:09:37].

This strategic alignment is often where [[impact_of_hr_decisions_on_careers | layoffs]] and [[impact_of_hr_decisions_on_careers | adverse employment decisions]] occur, as positions or contributions may not align with the company's new strategic direction [00:09:53]. At this level, decisions are purely business-oriented, leading to a perceived coldness or calculated approach by [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] [00:10:23]. During workforce planning, employees are often viewed as data or numbers on spreadsheets based on core competencies and metrics, rather than individuals [00:10:47].

### 3. Tertiary Purpose: Talent Attraction, Development, and Retention
The final purpose of [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] is to attract, develop, and retain talent through functions such as recruitment, establishing business practices and policies (which also fall under compliance/risk), hiring, developing employees, and benefits administration [00:11:55]. This "service-oriented" [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] function, which handles issues like paychecks, benefits, or time off, is where most employees are familiar with [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] [00:12:27].

The speaker notes that compassionate [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] professionals are typically found at these lower, "employee level" positions, such as local [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] representatives who are genuinely interested in helping employees [00:12:52]. However, as one moves higher in the organization, the function becomes more strategic and calculated, making it harder for individuals to separate their emotions from business decisions, leading to feelings of betrayal [00:13:24].

## When to Engage HR (and When to Be Cautious)
Employees should approach the [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resources]] department for legal issues, such as harassment or other illegal activities, to protect themselves [00:02:41]. Similarly, contacting [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] for issues related to benefits, paychecks, or policy interpretation is appropriate [00:16:42].

However, for situations like performance issues, conflicts with a boss, or personality conflicts, employees should be cautious and try to resolve issues without [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] involvement if possible [00:03:17]. Venting to the [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] department is not recommended because they are constantly listening for legal risks in what is being shared [00:17:31]. [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] was built and implemented by the highest levels of the corporation, not by employees, to be an advocate for the business [00:17:42].

## Employee Ownership of Career
The speaker emphasizes that individuals must take ownership of their careers and avoid being complacent or allowing organizations to steer them [00:04:18]. Trusting a company to always do the right thing for an employee can lead to adverse outcomes, as companies ultimately make decisions based on business interests [00:14:07].

To thrive, individuals should view themselves as "free agents," proactively preparing and practicing to stay at the top of their game [00:14:47]. Owning one's career and having clear direction reduces the impact of corporate decisions on personal employment [00:14:49].

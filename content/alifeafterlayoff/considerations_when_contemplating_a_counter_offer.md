When faced with a counter offer from your current employer after accepting a new job, it's crucial to think twice before accepting it, as past experiences show it often doesn't work out well for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As a career coach, the primary concern is the employee's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Case Study: A Real-Life Scenario

A Reddit post highlighted a common scenario: an individual accepted a job offer, gave notice, and then their current company suddenly surfaced "big plans" to keep them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The new opportunity offered a 30% pay bump from a non-competing company for similar work, but with expanded responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Initial Observations from the New Opportunity
*   **Lateral Move & Pay Bump:** A 30% pay increase for a lateral move to a non-competing company is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Such a large bump suggests the individual was either underpaid or had stayed in their current role for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Regularly checking the open market and taking interviews can help keep salaries honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Expanded Experience:** The new role offers expanded responsibilities, which will lead to more experience and a better resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It's generally advisable to avoid jumping jobs for a similar rate of pay, the same level of experience, and the same job title, as this can weaken your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut:** The individual's gut feeling that the new offer was the best course of action is a strong indicator; trusting your gut often leads in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Employer's Reaction and the "Dangling Carrot"
Upon resignation, the current boss asked how to keep the employee, followed by higher-level management suddenly revealing plans, such as hiring four to five new people to report to the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This phenomenon, where the company "can't live without you" after you tender your resignation, is a common trap known as the "proverbial carrot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These promises often involve waiting a little longer for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Handling Discussions with Current Employer
When approached by leadership, it's important to be in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Listen, Don't Divulge:** Hear them out, but do not disclose details about the new opportunity, such as salary, company name, or even job titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Disclosing information can lead to the current employer attempting to "torpedo" your new opportunity behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **State Your Commitment:** A good response is to simply state your intention to honor the commitment to the accepted offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Frame your departure not as leaving due to an issue, but as being pulled by a new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Conditions for Potentially Considering a Counter Offer
If a current employer offers a significantly higher salary, consider it only if:
*   **New Job Title & Level:** It comes with an entirely new job title and potentially a new level that unlocks a new vertical for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Documentation:** All proposed changes—new responsibilities, job description, pay range/grade—are fully documented in an official offer letter from HR, not just promises from your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### [[potential_risks_associated_with_accepting_a_counter_offer | Potential risks associated with accepting a counter offer]]
Accepting a counter offer carries several [[potential_risks of accepting a counter offer | risks]]:
*   **More Expensive Version:** You become a more expensive version of yourself, which can make you a target for future layoffs as the most expensive person in the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Flight Risk:** The company may view you as a flight risk because you've already played that card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Target on Your Back:** There will be a higher level of expectation, and any mistake could lead to scrutiny due to your increased compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Reneging on an Accepted Offer
Even after signing an offer letter, you are generally under no obligation to start a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. While it might upset the new recruiter, you must do what's best for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Recruiters will get over it and find another candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### The "Why Now?" Question
If your current employer offers a generous pay bump only after you've given notice, ask yourself: Why wasn't I worth it last week? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> This situation often indicates the company was taking you for granted, underpaying you, or simply caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. They might just be buying time before a future layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### [[impact_of_accepting_a_counter_offer_on_career_progression | Impact of accepting a counter offer on career progression]] & Succession Planning
If the counter offer includes promises of future leadership or senior-level roles, inquire about a written career plan and existing succession planning programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Respectable companies have these programs, offering development, mentoring, and even further education to targeted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. If you're not already part of such a program, it's a strong indicator that you were not truly part of their long-term aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Assessing Company Behavior
Your current company's past performance in treating employees is the best indicator of their future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Use your experience and observations to make an educated decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The risk with a new company is the uncertainty of their true behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Case Study Update: The Decision
The individual in the Reddit post ultimately decided not to accept the counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Vague Counter Offer:** Despite meetings with high-level executives, the counter offer was vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The company offered opportunities for "Data Engineering" but didn't have a clear job, suggesting they were improvising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Company-Centric View:** The discussions revolved around how the company "can use" the employee, not how they would help the employee grow their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This indicates a lack of focus on the employee's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Promotion Timelines:** While leadership saw potential, the employee recognized that significant career advancement would likely take five years or more, often only happening due to retirement or departure of current leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This is a common issue in companies where leadership roles are "cushy" and turnover is slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   **Red Flags:** The lack of a clear plan, the sudden scramble, and the focus on the company's needs were all red flags, indicating that "nothing changes with your existing company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

Ultimately, the individual chose to accept the new offer and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

## Conclusion
While there may be rare circumstances where accepting a counter offer is in your best interest, it's generally advisable to trust your gut and proceed with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The risks of being labeled a flight risk, becoming a layoff target, and facing unrealistic expectations often outweigh the immediate benefits of a pay bump at your current company.

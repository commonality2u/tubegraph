From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

Recent surveys and observations reveal a significant disconnect between what employers expect from new college graduates and the realities observed in the workplace, particularly concerning Generation Z (Gen Z) hires. This has led to a notable trend of companies being hesitant to hire, and quick to fire, recent graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## Current Trends in Hiring and Firing Gen Z

A survey conducted by Intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders involved in hiring decisions, highlighted several key findings:
*   75% of companies reported having hired Gen Z workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   Shockingly, 6 out of 10 companies admitted to firing a recent college graduate within the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   75% of companies reported at least one issue with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   One in six companies expressed hesitancy to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   Some employers are considering not hiring any college graduates in 2025 due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

This trend indicates that companies are not tolerating what they perceive as a [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_employers | cultural mismatch]] and are making employment decisions relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Employment Issues

Employers cited several reasons for issues with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>:

*   **Lack of Motivation or Initiative**: Cited by 50% of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Professionalism**: Cited by nearly 46% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational and Communication Skills**: These skills were often reported as lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Challenges with Feedback**: Not taking feedback well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Relevant Work Experience**: Employers noted this, despite these being entry-level positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This highlights a [[challenges_with_job_application_processes_and_employer_expectations | disconnect between employer expectations]] and the realities for [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market_for_entrylevel_candidates | entry-level candidates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Poor Problem-Solving Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Technical Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Bad Culture Fit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Difficulty Working in a Team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Employer Beliefs About Recent Graduates

Hiring managers hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>:
*   **Entitled**: Believed by 65-70% of hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This often manifests as wanting quick promotions without demonstrated experience or expecting high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Easily Offended**: Believed by 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Work Ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Doesn't Respond Well to Feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Unprepared for the Workforce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Poor Communication Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Motivation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Cost More to Train** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technological Skills**: Surprisingly, 28% reported this, despite Gen Z growing up with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

Many employers feel universities are not adequately preparing students for success in the modern workplace, citing a "huge cultural disconnect" and insufficient transition training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Observed Unprofessional Behaviors

Specific behaviors reported by employers include:
*   One in five saying graduates cannot often manage workload and are unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   About 20% reporting frequent lateness to start work and unprofessional dress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   19% observing inappropriate language at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a> and frequent lateness to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   17% believing graduates are often too difficult to manage and hand in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Lateness in the workplace is identified as a fast track to a performance improvement plan and termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Social Media Impact
The rise of social media also poses [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_employers | challenges]]. Employers actively check social media profiles before hiring to ensure a cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Posting about slacking off at work or sharing too much personal/political content can negatively impact an employer's impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## Desired Qualities in New Hires

Employers are looking for recent graduates who demonstrate:
*   **Initiative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>
*   **Positive Attitudes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>
*   **Strong Work Ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>
*   **Adaptability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>
*   **Openness to Feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>
*   **Punctuality and Reliability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>
*   **Organization and Preparedness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>
*   **Solid Technical Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>
*   **Interpersonal Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>
*   **Internship Experience**: Highly valued by recruiters for college programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Social Media Presence**: Employers expect discretion regarding work-related content and political topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

## Realities of the Current Job Market
Despite these employer expectations, Gen Z is entering the workplace during one of the most turbulent and difficult [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | job markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Many college graduates find themselves applying to thousands of positions to start their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

However, the speaker emphasizes that while it's easy to generalize about Gen Z, it is only a few "bad apples" that spoil the perception for the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. Many Gen Z employees are highly motivated, driven, and strategic, capable of achieving great things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.

### Positive Contributions of Gen Z
Gen Z is also seen as driving positive change in the workplace, particularly regarding work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. This generation is expected to continue making inroads towards improving the overall health and balance of the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary of Employer Expectations
> Employers are looking for fundamental qualities in new hires, including initiative, positive attitudes, strong work ethic, adaptability, and openness to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Punctuality, reliability, solid technical and interpersonal skills, and relevant internship experience are also highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

Example Case Studies
```
> [!NOTE] Case Study 1: The Phone-Addicted Accountant
> A Gen Z individual with an accounting diploma was fired from two accounting roles within the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. Her first termination was due to excessive phone use, which she attributed to the role being "boring" and the company culture having "snitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. Management eventually moved her desk directly in front of a manager to monitor her phone use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. The second firing was due to miscommunication about flexible hours and a colleague reporting her perceived lack of interaction and adherence to fixed schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. While she later learned from her mistakes and found a more fulfilling career, these instances highlight issues of engagement and understanding workplace expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Case Study 2: Chronic Tardiness and No-Call, No-Show
> An HR representative terminated an employee for repeated absenteeism and tardiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. The employee was late multiple times (12 minutes, 21 minutes, 32 minutes) and even had a no-call, no-show on her birthday, which she felt should be excused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. Her lack of responsibility and inability to see the issue with her consistent tardiness and unannounced absence were significant red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Case Study 3: Quiet Quitting/Quitting in Place
> A male Gen Z employee was fired after 15 months for "not doing anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. This exemplifies "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place," where an employee does minimal or no work while remaining employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>. Employers are increasingly unwilling to tolerate this behavior due to the competitive [[current_challenges_in_the_job_market | job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>.

When a company attempts to "quiet fire" an employee, meaning they make the work environment so unbearable that the employee feels compelled to quit, two significant indicators are lackluster performance appraisals and disengaged management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tactic, known as constructive dismissal, is often used to avoid potential issues if an employee were terminated, or to avoid paying out benefits like unemployment insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Lackluster Performance Appraisals

A sudden decline in performance appraisals can be a significant sign that a company is trying to manage an employee out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Signs of Lackluster Appraisals
*   **Sudden change in quality** Previously positive performance appraisals become lackluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Overly critical feedback** A [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | boss]] may become overly critical about aspects they previously praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Formal documentation** HR departments use performance appraisals for formal documentation, especially if an employee is deemed a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Demotivation** Being criticized, whether the feedback is accurate or not, can be a highly demotivating factor that may encourage an employee to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Disengaged Management

A [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | boss]] who becomes disengaged from an employee is another strong indicator of quiet firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Signs of Disengaged Management
*   **Poor communication** A [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | boss]] may stop communicating, miss private one-on-one meetings, or reschedule at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Lack of prioritization** The employee is no longer made a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Unresponsive behavior** Emails may go unanswered, or the [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | boss]] may be unavailable in their office, always seeming busy or with their door closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Lack of support** The [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | boss]] may fail to provide necessary information or help clear roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Exclusion from work** Employees may be removed from projects they were leading, not invited to staff meetings they previously attended, or excluded from informal "water cooler talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Social shunning** A [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | boss]] might shun an employee in public when with other colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## What to do if you suspect quiet firing

While one or two of these signs alone may not confirm quiet firing, it is crucial to pay attention and trust your intuition if you feel your days are numbered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. If you find yourself in a situation where you suspect the company is constructively discharging you, you have a few options:

1.  **Force their hand** Continue working as usual and allow the company to terminate you if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
2.  **Seek new employment** Quit your job and find a more supportive workplace. Staying in a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic environment]] is detrimental to personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
3.  **Consult legal counsel** If you believe you are being discriminated against, seek out a local attorney to understand your legal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Regardless of your chosen path, it is always best practice to keep your resume updated and ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

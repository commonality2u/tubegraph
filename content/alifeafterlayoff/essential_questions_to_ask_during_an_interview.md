Navigating the job interview process can be challenging, akin to traversing a minefield where a single misstep can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While various factors can lead to an interview rejection, such as motivational mismatches or lack of experience, what you say or don't say often places you in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Even seemingly innocent statements can lead to being rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A corporate recruiter shares ten things you should never say in an interview if you're serious about getting the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## What Not to Ask or Say During an Interview

### 1. "What Does Your Company Do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
Asking this question reveals a lack of preparation and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Prior to the interview, candidates are expected to conduct basic research on:
*   The company's core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Products offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   New technology rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

This research demonstrates genuine interest in the company's mission, vision, and values, and helps assess if the company's core values align with your own, preventing a potential cultural mismatch and turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### 2. "What Does This Role Entail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
While interviewers will provide some detail, candidates are expected to have thoroughly read the job description and understand the position's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Asking about the role's basics indicates a lack of homework and sends a message that you are not a problem-solver who takes initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### 3. "What Are the Hours?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
For salaried, non-exempt professional positions, directly asking about hours suggests you might be a "clock-watcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If you have concerns about work conditions, reframe the [[key_indicators_and_questions_during_interview | question]] to avoid sounding like you're trying to avoid work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Instead, ask about:**
    *   The culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
    *   Expectations in the first 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
    *   Which shift you might support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>

### 4. "When Can I Get a Promotion/My Boss's Job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
It's reasonable to consider career paths, but immediately asking about promotion suggests a lack of interest in the current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Instead, ask about:**
    *   Career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
    *   Potential long-term growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

Show excitement for the position at hand and eagerness to learn about the corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### 5. Asking About Salary Too Early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
While salary is important, asking about it at the very beginning, before understanding the role, is a major turn-off for employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Allow the recruiter to bring up compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If you've already discussed salary with HR in a previous round, do not ask the hiring manager about pay ranges, as this suggests you are "fishing for a better answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### 6. Not Answering the Salary Expectation Question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
When asked about your salary expectations, avoiding the question or claiming ignorance of market rates demonstrates unpreparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. You should have a target number in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Failure to answer will likely prevent you from advancing to the next interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 7. Speaking Poorly of Past Employers or Bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
While tempting to vent about negative past experiences, interviewers are not interested in hearing about your "crappy boss" or "messy" former company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Recruiters are focused solely on assessing your fit for their company and role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Speaking ill of past experiences is unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Be gracious, highlight what you learned, and show genuine interest in the current opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### 8. Saying "I'm Nervous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
It's understood that [[job_interview_experiences | interviewing]] can be nerve-wracking, especially if unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. While a recruiter might offer "softball questions" to help you relax, you are ultimately expected to take ownership of the interview and exude confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Excessive nervousness can hurt your chances, particularly at the hiring manager level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The best advice is to be well-[[interview_questions_preparation | prepared]] and know how to sell yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### 9. Being Overly Casual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
While a relaxed demeanor can help break the ice, being too casual, using colorful language, or speaking like you're at a bar can be offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Default to using the name the interviewer introduced themselves with and never use terms like "boss" or "bro," as they can be considered derogatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Maintaining a polished and professional demeanor is crucial for a favorable [[successful_job_interview_indicators | impression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### 10. Not Asking Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
At the end of the interview, you will be asked if you have any [[significance_of_asking_questions_in_interview | questions]]. Not having a list of well-thought-out, intelligent [[asking_questions_to_interviewers | questions to ask the hiring manager during an interview]] about the company, culture, or your potential fit shows a lack of interest or awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Always come prepared with [[questions_to_ask_the_hiring_manager_during_an_interview | questions]] to demonstrate engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

By avoiding these common pitfalls and staying well-prepared, you can significantly improve your chances of succeeding in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Upon receiving a job offer, companies typically indicate that the offer is contingent on the successful completion of a background check, which often includes employment verification and a potential drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This process aims to confirm the accuracy of information provided by the candidate on their job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Verification Process

Employers generally [[components_of_employment_background_checks | outsource the background check process]] to a third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This third party collects information from the candidate and verifies it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. When a candidate fills out a job application on an ATS (Applicant Tracking System), it serves as a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The application often includes a certification stating that all information provided is correct and accurate, and it becomes a permanent part of the employment record upon hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Usually, a section in the application or a separate form also grants the employer the right to conduct a background check upon job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Resources Used for Verification

Employers utilize various resources to check a candidate's background, including:
*   Searching databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Verifying submitted employment records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Contacting current or most recent employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A common starting point for employment verification is "Work Number," a database where millions of employers submit information about their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This database can verify employment records and, in some cases, income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, it's important to note that employers generally do not check previous income, as it is becoming an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. If database information is insufficient, the third-party company may directly contact former employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Information Verified

The primary details checked during employment verification include:
*   Confirmation that the candidate worked for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Dates of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Job titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Most employers typically verify work history going back seven to ten years, though some may check all the way back to the beginning of a candidate's work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Job Title Discrepancies

While it is generally advised not to lie on a resume, minor adjustments to job titles to better suit a target industry might not be an issue during a background check if they represent the same level of position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. For example, changing "recruiter" to "talent acquisition specialist" (if it was the actual title) would likely not be a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

However, a significant discrepancy, such as claiming a "Director of Talent Acquisition" title when one was an individual contributor, would be a major red flag and could pose serious problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Similarly, "fudging" employment dates to gain extra work experience is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Other Background Checks

In addition to employment and job title verification, employers also typically conduct:
*   [[components_of_employment_background_checks | Criminal background checks]], which look for felonies and misdemeanors, usually going back seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   [[education_and_certification_verification | Education verification]], confirming attendance and degrees from claimed schools, and verifying certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Consequences of Failing a Background Check

If there is a discrepancy or an inability to verify information, the employer receives a detailed report from the third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The employer may circle back to the candidate for clarification or verification, or they could potentially [[how to know if you got the job | rescind the job offer]] immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

It is crucial for candidates to be honest about their accomplishments and the information on their job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Since the job application is a legal document, falsifying information can lead to termination for cause, even if discovered after employment has begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Attempting to use a friend or family member as a false employment verifier is highly risky and can result in a rescinded offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Being forthcoming with one's background and ensuring all stated credentials are accurate is the recommended approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Reference checks are a common component of the hiring process, used by recruiters and human resources professionals to gather more information about job candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. They involve contacting individuals provided by the candidate, such as former managers or colleagues, to inquire about their work ethic, attendance, strengths, weaknesses, and eligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## When Are References Checked?
While some companies do require reference checks, this practice is more commonly observed in smaller companies or agencies that submit candidates to larger corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. These smaller entities may conduct the reference check on behalf of a larger company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It's important for candidates to provide good references, as these will likely be followed up on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Most major employers, however, generally do not check references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. When they do, the reference check is often a final formality, rather than a heavily weighted factor, as long as the feedback is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. It's usually one of the last steps before a job offer is extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Information Sought During Reference Checks
During a reference check, a recruiter will typically ask a series of questions related to the job, work ethic, attendance (especially for hourly positions), and any concerns they should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. They also inquire about strengths and weaknesses, and whether the candidate would be eligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Generally, there are about three to five standard questions asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Challenges in Reference Checks
Recruiters sometimes face difficulty tracking down references and getting them to return calls, which can delay the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This highlights the importance of informing your references that they may be contacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Liability Concerns
Many companies, especially larger corporations, are reluctant to provide detailed references due to [[liability_concerns_with_providing_references | liability concerns with providing references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If a former employer gives a negative reference that prevents a candidate from getting a job, they could be liable for slander or similar legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Human resources professionals prioritize limiting this exposure to liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This is also why feedback during interviews can be limited, as a team of attorneys advises generic feedback to avoid legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Information Provided by Larger Companies
Large companies often instruct their employees, particularly those with direct reports, not to give out references directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Instead, all reference inquiries are filtered through the human resources department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. When contacted, most large corporations will only provide basic information: the candidate's name, dates of employment (start and end), and job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They typically do not disclose compensation, eligibility for rehire, or reasons for termination to avoid further liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Therefore, if a recruiter calls from a larger corporation, they are unlikely to receive extensive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Tips for Job Seekers Providing References
If you are asked for references, take it seriously and put thought into your choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*   **Choose Legitimate Professional References**:
    *   Aim for at least one direct manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   Ideally, all three references should be managers, as this provides the most valid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   If a manager isn't possible for a second reference, choose a customer you directly supported (internal or external) rather than a peer, as a peer's reference is less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Someone one or two levels above you who can speak to your performance would be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Ensure a Positive Recommendation**:
    *   Confirm that the person you list will actually provide a good reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Avoid including anyone you suspect might give a negative or lukewarm recommendation, as this can derail your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. You should generally know who you have good working relationships with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **Ask for Permission and Inform Them**:
    *   Always ask permission from individuals before listing them as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Inform them that you are interviewing and that they might receive a call, and ask if they are willing to take it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   Not informing them can cause delays, as they might mistake the recruiter's call for spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

While the [[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | impact of references on the hiring process]] might be less significant for larger corporations, taking the process seriously and preparing strong, legitimate references can help you cross the finish line for a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

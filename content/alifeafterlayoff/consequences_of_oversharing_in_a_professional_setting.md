Being too open or revealing too much personal or work-related information can lead to significant repercussions in a professional environment. What might seem like an innocent comment can quickly be misconstrued, affecting credibility and career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## A Cautionary Tale from HR
The speaker recounts an experience from their first job as an HR generalist at a manufacturing and global engineering company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. During a two-year nomadic period, they were assigned to a small town facility, responsible for staffing and employee relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

They developed a rapport with a line worker who was around their age, considering him somewhat of a [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | friend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. One weekend, they joined this co-worker and his [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | friends]] at a local bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The conversation eventually turned to work, and the co-worker asked for the speaker's thoughts on a new, inexperienced supervisor named Joe, whom the speaker was helping to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The speaker made a comment they considered "relatively innocent," stating that Joe was "still growing" and that they were "helping him with some things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The following week, the speaker's boss informed them that Joe was upset because the co-worker had gone into Joe's office on Monday morning and claimed the speaker was "spreading rumors" and "doesn't have any faith" in him as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The speaker was "dumbfounded" by the breach of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Consequently, the speaker had to apologize profusely to Joe and assure him it wouldn't happen again to maintain an effective working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This incident taught the speaker to be "very careful with people that you choose to be [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | friendly]] with at work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Risks of Oversharing

### Credibility and Career Impact
Even seemingly innocent comments can lead to [[oversharing_personal_information_in_interviews | oversharing]], which often "finds a way of getting back to you through your boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. If a boss hears through the grapevine that an employee is not to be trusted, it creates a "major credibility issue," potentially stunting long-term career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Being branded as "untrustworthy" can severely damage one's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Association with Workplace Gossip
[[oversharing_personal_information_in_interviews | Oversharing]] is closely linked to [[navigating_workplace_gossip_and_its_impact | gossiping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Every office typically has an "[[navigating_workplace_gossip_and_its_impact | office gossip]]," identifiable by their tendency to congregate in lunchrooms or around the water cooler to stir up drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Engaging in "water cooler talk" makes it easy to cross the line into [[oversharing_personal_information_in_interviews | oversharing]] or saying something regrettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. More importantly, associating with [[navigating_workplace_gossip_and_its_impact | gossips]] can lead to being branded as an "[[navigating_workplace_gossip_and_its_impact | office gossip]]" oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Leadership teams are aware of who belongs to which "cliques," and being branded this way can hinder upward career mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

HR professionals often find that office gossips are among the "usual suspects" in employee relation issues that need diffusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Negative Influences
[[navigating_workplace_gossip_and_its_impact | Office gossips]] often possess a negative mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Spending too much time with negative colleagues, who constantly complain about the boss, company, pay, or workload, can drag one down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Such negativity can become a "cancer in a group" and be very distracting for someone focused on upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Competition and Compromised Relationships
Workplace [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | friendships]] can become strained or disappear when opportunities for promotion arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. If a co-worker becomes a supervisor, and they know "all your dirty secrets" from water cooler conversations, it can compromise the new supervisor, especially if they are in an awkward situation or an unscrupulous co-worker dangles that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Jealousy over career progression can also hold one back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Socializing Outside of Work
Participating in happy hours or other outside-work events with co-workers can also be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Alcohol can lead to "loose lips" and being "too touchy feely," blurring the "very fine line between being chummy and harassment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. An off-color joke, even if unintentional, can offend someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. A long-standing adage in HR is that "anything that you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Conclusion
While it's possible to build [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | friendships]] with co-workers, it is crucial to "pick and choose your [[networking_and_maintaining_professional_relationships | friends]] very carefully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Maintaining [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professionalism]] requires being cautious about behavior, what is said, and what is shared with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

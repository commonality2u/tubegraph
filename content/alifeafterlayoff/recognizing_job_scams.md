An unbelievable job application form shared on LinkedIn highlights numerous [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags in job applications]] and practices that can indicate a job scam or a very low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This particular form was sent by an international company to a talent acquisition manager applying for a US-based remote role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. While the company's legitimacy couldn't be fully confirmed, the application raised significant concerns, showcasing what job seekers should watch out for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## [[Identifying red flags in job postings | Key Red Flags in the Application Process]]

Job seekers should keep their radar up for several indicators that an opportunity may be a scam or from a low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>:

*   **Direct HR Involvement for Large Corporations**: If a large corporation does not have a dedicated talent acquisition department and recruitment is handled directly by Human Resources, it can be a [[how_to_identify_low_quality_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This is more common in localized factory settings but not typically for larger, reputable companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Manual Forms Instead of ATS**: Reputable companies typically use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) or online application portals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. If an employer sends over a manual form to fill out that is not part of an ATS or online application, it's another [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Requests for Money or Cashing Checks**: Be extremely cautious if an employer asks you to cash any checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This is a common tactic in [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience | job scams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

It's crucial to vet the opportunity by cross-referencing information with the company's corporate website to ensure there are real people working there and avoid being scammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## [[Red flags in job applications | Illegal and Invasive Questions]]

The application form in question contained numerous questions that are illegal under US anti-discrimination laws, especially when hiring for roles based in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>:

> [!CAUTION] Illegal Questions in US Job Applications
>
> 1.  **Marital/Civil Status**: Questions about whether you are single, married, divorced, separated, or have a significant other are completely illegal and have no bearing on job ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
> 2.  **Children/Family Status**: Asking if you have kids, how many minors, or if you have childcare for working hours is highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate based on family status or perceived childcare issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
> 3.  **Nationality/Country of Origin**: Questions about passports held, nationality, country of birth, or country of origin are illegal as they disclose national origin, a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. The only legal question is if you are legally able to work in the country without sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
> 4.  **Age**: Directly asking for your age is illegal due to ageism concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
> 5.  **Religion**: Inquiring about your religion or any past religious changes is illegal, as religion is a protected class against discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
> 6.  **Height and Weight**: While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight requirements can disproportionately limit opportunities for protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. Unless directly job-related, such inquiries should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
> 7.  **Medical Conditions/History**: Asking about medical conditions, medications, or upcoming surgeries is a significant invasion of privacy and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

### Legitimate vs. Illegal Question Phrasing

Instead of asking about protected characteristics, employers should phrase questions to determine if a candidate can meet the job's requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. For example:
*   Instead of "Do you have childcare for working hours?", a legal question would be "This position requires you to work [set schedule/hours]. Are you able to meet that requirement?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   Instead of "What is your nationality?", a legal question would be "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Problematic Employers

Even if not an outright scam, an employer asking such invasive and illegal questions suggests they are unprofessional, potentially discriminatory, or unaware of employment laws, particularly for roles based in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. These are [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flag employers]] that job seekers should aim to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

It's crucial to remain vigilant, as job scams have been on the rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

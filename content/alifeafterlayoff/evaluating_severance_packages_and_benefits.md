Upon receiving a layoff notification, it is crucial to carefully evaluate your severance package and benefits. It is not advisable to sign the severance agreement immediately, as companies typically provide at least a couple of weeks to review and sign it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The purpose of a severance package for a company is often to limit their liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Understanding Your Severance Agreement

It's vital to fully comprehend all components of your severance agreement and identify any areas that might be negotiable, especially regarding the continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### COBRA Coverage

Companies are legally required to offer you the opportunity to continue your benefits through COBRA coverage for a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. However, under COBRA, you are responsible for paying the full cost of the benefits your former employer previously subsidized, which can be extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

When unemployed, the priority should be to minimize cost exposure rather than seeking the most comprehensive benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. A recommended strategy is to decline COBRA and instead request any continuation of benefits to be paid out as a lump sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. You can then use this sum to shop for a new, often catastrophic, health plan on the government marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This approach can lead to significant savings—potentially several thousand dollars—due to tax benefits for individuals with drastically reduced incomes, allowing your funds to stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Negotiation Leverage

While being laid off generally reduces your [[salary_negotiation_strategies | negotiation leverage]], there are situations where you might be able to negotiate for additional benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. If you belong to a protected class (e.g., over the age of 40), companies may be more willing to offer extra benefits to reduce their liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It is always worth asking about compensation for missed bonuses or unvested equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Outplacement Assistance

Many companies offer outplacement assistance, which connects you with a service that helps with resume writing, job searching, and career consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. However, the quality of these services can vary greatly, with some offering "horrifically bad" advice on resumes and interview strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

A recommended alternative is to ask for the outplacement assistance as a lump sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This lump sum, often ranging from $3,000 to $5,000, can then be used to hire an independent career coach whom you choose and resonate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This approach often results in a better level of service and allows you to pocket any remaining funds, which is valuable during unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

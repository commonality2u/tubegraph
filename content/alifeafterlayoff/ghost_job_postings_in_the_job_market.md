Job seekers may encounter numerous job listings, but a significant number of these may be [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | fake job postings]], often referred to as "ghost postings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. These are jobs that an employer posts with no real intention of ever filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Phenomenon of Ghost Postings

The current job market presents conflicting data: while the Federal Reserve might describe it as robust with a record number of job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, major corporations are simultaneously announcing layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This discrepancy leads to situations where positions are posted but seemingly never filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Pipelining Wrecks
A common type of ghost posting is a "pipelining wreck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is a job posted by an employer with the primary goal of collecting resumes for a future date, without any immediate intention of filling the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. These exist in the market, even from companies that have recently undergone massive layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Leaders in talent acquisition have been known to suggest posting these "pipelining wrecks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Impact on Job Seekers
This [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | employer recruitment practices]] creates a poor candidate experience, especially for those who have been laid off and are actively seeking employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Job seekers invest time in crafting targeted resumes and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, only to find that the employer has no genuine intention of hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This can be particularly frustrating in areas with limited job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Furthermore, the reported "record number of job openings" can be misleading. Many of these might be contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that do not offer benefits or career-type jobs, leading job seekers to feel disconnected from the perceived robust market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Survey Insights on Ghost Jobs

A survey conducted by Clarify Capital between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, questioned 1,045 managers involved in the hiring process about ghost jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Key Findings:
*   **68% of managers** had job postings active for more than 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. While many highly skilled positions naturally take longer to fill (45-60 days average time-to-fill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, some instances were more extreme.
*   **1 in 10 hiring managers** had a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Such long-open "aging wrecks" often indicate underlying issues like an overly particular hiring manager or a niche skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **1 in 5 managers** did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This suggests ambiguity in employer hiring plans, potentially tied to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **50% of managers** kept job postings open because "they're always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## [[employer_strategies_behind_fake_job_listings | Reasons Why Employers Post Ghost Jobs]]

The survey also identified the most common [[reasons_why_employers_ghost_candidates | reasons why employers ghost candidates]] by not actively trying to fill a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>:

*   **Company is always open to new people (50%):** Employers want to "window shop" for talent, keeping job requisitions (wrecks) open to see who applies, without a general intention to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated:** This is seen as deceitful, as it falsely suggests opportunities for internal movement or relief from workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing:** This tactic is considered highly questionable and potentially illegal, as it can mislead both job candidates and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **The job was filled:** This indicates negligence on the part of the recruiter or HR, who should remove a filled posting from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates/applicants in case of turnover:** Similar to how job seekers should always be "free agents," companies maintain candidate pools for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies:** This reflects "lazy recruiting," where employers passively wait for exceptional talent without active recruitment efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **To placate overworked employees:** This is a "sinister" reason, as it falsely reassures overloaded staff that help is coming when there's no actual intent to hire, potentially leading to burnout and resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Forgot to delete the job ("Whoopsie Daisy"):** Another instance of recruiter or HR negligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **No reason in particular/They simply don't care:** Reflects a lack of consideration for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_identify_and_avoid_fake_job_postings | How to Identify and Avoid Ghost Job Postings]]

To avoid falling victim to ghost jobs, job seekers should employ specific [[strategies_to_identify_and_avoid_fake_job_postings | strategies to identify and avoid fake job postings]]:

*   **Check the Job Posting Age:** If a job has been up for more than six months, or if it's repeatedly posted over a long period, it's likely a ghost wreck or indicates a dysfunctional hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. These are [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | low quality job postings]] from potentially [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | low quality employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Conduct Reverse Reference Checks:** Investigate whether the company recently had major layoffs, especially in roles similar to the one posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If they are posting roles they just eliminated, they may be trying to build a pipeline, indicating a lack of loyalty to that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Scrutinize the Job Description:** A detailed job description with specifics about responsibilities, accomplishments, and team support suggests a more serious and active recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Generic, sales-focused descriptions are a significant red flag for pipelining wrecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Consider Recency of the Post:** A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an active and legitimate recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

By applying these strategies, job seekers can focus their efforts on high-quality roles with legitimate employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

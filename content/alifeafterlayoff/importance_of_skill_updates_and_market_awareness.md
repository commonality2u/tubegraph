Being overly loyal to an employer can be costly, as loyalty often proves to be a one-way street, not benefiting the employee in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The [[navigating_career_transitions_and_job_market_changes | labor market]] has recently shown that many long-term, loyal employees are finding themselves set back in their careers due to this oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Case of Bob: A Cautionary Tale

Consider the example of Bob, who spent 20 years with the same company and in the same job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He was a well-liked, steady contributor who was comfortable in his role and not looking to climb the corporate ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. His annual performance appraisals were consistently "steady," and his merit raises typically ranged from cost-of-living to about three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

After 21 years, Bob was unexpectedly laid off, told his position was affected by business changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. He was in shock, assuming his long-term loyalty and steady performance would protect him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### The Consequences of Stagnation

Forced into an unwanted job search, Bob struggled immensely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Despite nearly 30 years of experience and significant project work, his phone wasn't ringing for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The few interviews he secured were for roles of much lower quality, with worse pay and benefits, representing a massive step backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The main issue was that the best employers in his industry demanded a new set of skills, particularly exposure to modern technology, software, and processes that Bob lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. His previous company had their own established ways and didn't value these new advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Bob realized he was "hopelessly out of date" and the [[understanding_job_market_dynamics_and_timing_career_moves | market had completely passed him by]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Fifteen years earlier, a disruptive technology had emerged, leading to several new technologies, but Bob's company stuck with the old standard, and he felt no need to upgrade his skills due to a steady paycheck and a belief he was a "lifer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

In addition to skill gaps, Bob had also fallen significantly behind on wages. Entry-level employees at his old company were being paid nearly the same as him, despite his 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Market research revealed he was underpaid by almost $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Strategies for Career Longevity

To avoid Bob's fate, employees must proactively manage their careers.

### Act Like a Free Agent
Always view yourself as a free agent, constantly monitoring the current [[relevance_of_skills_in_a_changing_job_market | job market]] for in-demand skills and employer requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. It's crucial to acquire the latest and most up-to-date skills to keep your resume marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Even if your current employer doesn't value new skills or methodologies, other employers likely will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

While you shouldn't operate out of fear of layoffs, always be prepared for such an event or for the opportunity to pounce on a better role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Monitor Wage Data
Regularly assess your wage data, ideally at least once every two years, to understand where your compensation sits within the broader industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. If you find yourself falling behind, take proactive steps to either address it within your current role or prepare for a move to a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

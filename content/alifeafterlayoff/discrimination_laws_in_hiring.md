A review of a job application form shared by a talent acquisition manager on LinkedIn highlights several questions that are illegal or indicative of [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | problematic hiring practices]], particularly when recruiting for a US-based remote role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even if an international company is recruiting candidates from the United States, they must adhere to US employment laws and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Red Flags in Hiring Practices

Several indicators can suggest a low-quality or potentially [[predatory_hiring_practices | scammy employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29">[01:29]</a>:
*   **HR handling recruitment** If a large corporation does not have a dedicated talent acquisition department and recruitment is handled solely by the Human Resources department, it can be a [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04">[01:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** Sending a manual form to be filled out instead of using an ATS system or an online application process is another [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>.
*   **Requests for Payment** Job seekers should be very aware if an employer asks them to cash checks or pay for anything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[03:19]</a>.

Candidates should vet the opportunity by checking if there are actual people working at the company and cross-referencing information with their corporate website to avoid scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>.

## Illegal Questions in US Job Applications

The following types of questions, when asked directly on a job application in the United States, are considered illegal due to anti-discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23">[02:23]</a>:

*   **Marital Status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>
    *   **Examples of illegal questions**: "What is your civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, significant other)?" or asking for additional comments about personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>.
    *   **Reason it's illegal**: Marital status has no bearing on an individual's ability to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03">[05:03]</a>.
*   **Family Status / Children** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>
    *   **Examples of illegal questions**: "Do you have any kids? If yes, how many minors?" or "Do you have childcare for your children during working hours?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>.
    *   **Reason it's illegal**: Employers have been known to discriminate against individuals with children, assuming they might take more time off due to childcare issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>. Laws in the United States prohibit discrimination based on family status or whether someone has kids or is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21">[06:21]</a>.
    *   **How it should be asked legally**: An employer can state the job's required schedule or conditions and ask if the applicant is able to meet those requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a>.
*   **National Origin / Nationality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">[07:24]</a>
    *   **Examples of illegal questions**: "What passports do you hold and nationality?" or "Country of birth or country of origin?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">[07:24]</a>.
    *   **Reason it's illegal**: Disclosing national origin is an illegal question in the United States, as it has no bearing on the ability to do the job, assuming the applicant is legally permitted to work in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55">[07:55]</a>. It is directly listed as illegal in EEOC statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42">[08:42]</a>.
    *   **How it should be asked legally**: An employer can ask, "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>. If international travel is a job requirement, they can ask if the applicant can meet the travel conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04">[08:04]</a>.
*   **Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30">[09:30]</a>
    *   **Example of illegal question**: Asking for an applicant's age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30">[09:30]</a>.
    *   **Reason it's illegal**: This leads to [[age_discrimination_in_the_job_market | age discrimination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a>.
*   **Religion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>
    *   **Examples of illegal questions**: Asking about an applicant's religion, or if their religion was different at birth and requesting further details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>.
    *   **Reason it's illegal**: Religion is a protected class, and employers cannot discriminate based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>.
*   **Height and Weight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18">[11:18]</a>
    *   **Examples of potentially illegal questions**: Asking about height and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18">[11:18]</a>.
    *   **Reason it's illegal**: According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), height and weight requirements can disproportionately limit employment opportunities for some protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49">[11:49]</a>. Unless directly related to a job requirement, such inquiries may be viewed as illegal under federal law, and some states/municipalities specifically prohibit discrimination based on height and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02">[12:02]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions / Health History** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27">[12:27]</a>
    *   **Examples of illegal questions**: "Do you have any medical conditions? If so, please elaborate, mention the type of medications you're taking, or if you have any surgeries coming up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27">[12:27]</a>.
    *   **Reason it's illegal**: These are highly invasive questions with no direct bearing on job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41">[12:41]</a>.

While some of these questions might be common on resumes from certain countries (e.g., India, Asian-Pacific countries, Mexico, South America) where applicants self-report age, weight, and marital status, they are illegal in the US context for job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22">[11:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

Encountering a job application with a combination of these illegal or unusual questions is a strong [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] that points to a low-quality employer, a potential scam, or an unprofessional company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30">[13:30]</a>. Job seekers should keep their radar up for such signs to avoid [[predatory_hiring_practices | low-quality employers]] and potential scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59">[13:59]</a>.

The current [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | job market]] presents conflicting data, with reports of record job openings juxtaposed with major corporate layoffs. This discrepancy points to the phenomenon of "ghost postings" or "fake job postings," which are listings an employer has no real intention of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

## Conflicting Market Signals
Official data may suggest a robust [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry | job market]] with a record number of job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. However, this conflicts with frequent layoff announcements from major corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Many seemingly available positions never get filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. The employment pendulum appears to have swung back to the employer's favor, leading to practices like forcing employees back to the office and the increase in ghost postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

The reported total number of job openings may be misleading, as many are often contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that may not include benefits and are not considered career-type jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This creates frustration for job seekers who are told the market is robust but experience otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## What are Ghost Postings?
A "ghost posting" is a job advertisement placed by an employer with no genuine intention of ever filling the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Pipelining Requisitions (Wrecks)
Pipelining wrecks are job postings designed solely to collect resumes for a future date, without immediate plans to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Employers use them to build a candidate pool, theoretically gaining a head start when they decide to recruit again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This practice is considered shady, especially when a company has recently had significant layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Such listings can lead to a very poor candidate experience, as job seekers invest time in crafting targeted resumes for positions that are not genuinely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs
A survey conducted by Clarify Capital between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, surveyed 1,045 managers involved in hiring about ghost jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Key findings include:
*   68% of managers had job postings active for over 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   1 in 10 hiring managers had a job posting active for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   1 in 5 managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   50% of managers keep job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

The most common reasons for not actively trying to fill a position include:
*   **Company is always open to new people (50%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This means employers are "window shopping" for candidates without an immediate intention to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This can be a deceptive tactic to falsely assure existing staff that help is coming for their workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This is considered deceitful to both job candidates and potential investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **The job was filled** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. In this case, the job posting should be removed promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates in case there is turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. This is seen as lazy and irresponsible recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   **Forgot to delete the job** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.
*   **No reason in particular/simply don't care** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Ghost Postings
Job seekers can take steps to identify and avoid falling victim to ghost job postings:
*   **Check the posting date:** If a job has been up for more than six months, it's likely a ghost wreck or a position the employer has no intention of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   **Repeated postings:** If the same "wreck" is posted repeatedly over a long period, it's a strong indicator of a ghost posting or issues with the hiring manager/turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. These situations often indicate a low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Reverse reference checks:** Research the company to see if they've had recent major layoffs, especially if the posted positions are similar to those affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This could indicate they are trying to build a pipeline for future rehires, showing a lack of loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
*   **Job description detail:** Legitimate postings typically have detailed job descriptions with specifics about responsibilities and reporting structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Generic or "salesy" descriptions are a red flag for pipelining wrecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   **Recency of the post:** A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an active, legitimate recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

Job seekers should treat themselves as "free agents" and prioritize applying for high-quality roles with legitimate employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

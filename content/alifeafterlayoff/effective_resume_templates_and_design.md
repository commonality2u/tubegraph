When crafting a resume, the primary goal is to present your qualifications clearly and concisely to potential employers, ultimately securing more job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. There isn't one definitive "right" way to write a resume, and its effectiveness is determined by whether it yields the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The following advice is based on a [[recruiter_perspective_on_resume_writing | corporate recruiter perspective]] and feedback from hiring managers on how they quickly screen resumes, typically in a 5-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Recruiters aim to quickly find what they are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Therefore, the presentation of your resume must capture attention quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Template Selection

Many resumes need improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key step is to stop using outdated templates, especially those designed by graphic designers found on platforms like Canva.com or large industry resume hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Why Avoid Graphic-Rich Templates

Templates with excessive graphics, charts, and "cute" presentations are generally a bad idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. They tend to distract from the core purpose of the resume, which is to allow recruiters to quickly find relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Such templates are often designed by individuals who do not understand how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) parse resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Recommended Template Features

*   **Simplicity:** A very simple template, such as one from Microsoft Word, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Column Layout:** Opt for a one-column template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Colors:** Avoid bright and flashy colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Stick to basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For most job seekers, a resume should be "relatively boring" in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Fonts:** Ensure fonts are very clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Exception for Creative Fields

If you are a graphic designer or in another creative field, you might consider a more creative approach to your resume, as this might be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, even then, it's advisable not to use a template designed by another graphic designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## ATS Compliance in Design

Templates designed without ATS knowledge are often ineffective because they don't parse well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Contact Information Formatting

*   **Vertical Layout:** Format your contact information vertically instead of horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. ATS typically struggles to read and parse horizontal contact details effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Testing Compliance:** If you find that ATS is not cleanly parsing your name, phone number, address, etc., and you frequently have to manually enter this data, your resume is likely not [[resume_best_practices_and_ats_compliance | ATS compliant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. While contact information isn't usually the reason for not being contacted, proper formatting can speed up your application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Content and Readability

The design of a resume also encompasses how its content is presented to ensure readability and conciseness.

### Avoid Wordiness

*   **Conciseness:** Do not include massive blocks of text, as recruiters and hiring managers will likely skip over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Aim for conciseness and selective word choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Clarity:** Make the resume easy to scan by formatting it cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Language Use

*   **Avoid Proprietary Language:** Refrain from using proprietary language, project names, division names, or product types unique to your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The open market will not understand these terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Instead, convey concepts in clear, common language relevant to the industry you are applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Remove Fluffy Terminology:** Eliminate generic, fluffy phrases like "team player" or "great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. These phrases cause recruiters to "roll their eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Important competencies will be assessed in an interview, not effectively conveyed through such terms on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Focus on actionable terms and concepts related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The objective is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job to get called for an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Continuous Improvement

If your resume isn't yielding results, it's time to redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Continuously doing the same thing and expecting different results is not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. If you're frequently rejected at the application level, your resume is likely not working for you, especially if you believe you have a clear fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Review the job posting carefully to ensure your resume clearly conveys your fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

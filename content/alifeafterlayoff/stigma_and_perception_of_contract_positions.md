When seeking employment, many individuals encounter contract positions, which often involve similar work to full-time roles but are sometimes viewed differently. There is a general [[pros_and_cons_of_contract_work_versus_fulltime_employment | stigma]] associated with contract work, leading some to perceive it as lower quality or merely temporary, lacking the stability of a full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This perception can lead job seekers to avoid these opportunities initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Recruiter and Hiring Manager Perspectives

A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience notes that recruiters and career coaches view contract roles from specific angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. From an employer's viewpoint, contract positions are often seen as less risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Risk Aversion
[[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | Hiring managers]] tend to be risk-averse because they are responsible for the headcount and the performance of their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. They worry about making poor hiring decisions that could leave them with someone they need to develop, preferring candidates who can "plug and go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. In situations where roles are difficult to fill due to niche skill sets or the need to be flexible on candidate skills, contract positions can be a strategic way to mitigate this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This allows a candidate to prove their capabilities, with the possibility of converting to a full-time role if they perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

While not every contract position is intended for conversion, many are created to allow managers to be less selective upfront and assess performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Asking if a contract role has the likelihood to convert is a useful question for candidates during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### "Hopping Resume" Bias
One significant negative perception for career contractors, especially those early in their careers, is the appearance of a "hopping resume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | Hiring managers]] across various corporations consistently express concern about candidates who have worked short stints (e.g., six, eight, or nine months) at multiple places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. They seek candidates who demonstrate commitment to long-term projects, process improvement, and the ability to build lasting relationships within a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Short-term contract employees are generally not perceived as forming these deep, long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This bias can be a challenge for young professionals in a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Personal and Emotional Impact

Beyond external perceptions, contract roles can also impact the individual's sense of [[job_security_and_benefits_in_contract_versus_fulltime_roles | job security and benefits]].

### Sense of Limbo and Uncertainty
Unlike full-time roles, contract positions often lack benefits such as health insurance or retirement plans, though some agencies may offer them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This absence of [[job_security_and_benefits_in_contract_versus_fulltime_roles | benefits]] and the inherent temporary nature can create a feeling of "limbo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Individuals may still feel compelled to look for their next position while working, as they constantly need to plan for what happens after the contract ends, especially if conversion to full-time is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Lack of Commitment and Belonging
A contract role can also lead to a feeling that the employer is not fully committed to the individual, lacking clear career advancement opportunities beyond potential conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This can translate into a sense of not truly belonging to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Contractors might feel excluded from long-term discussions or future plans, knowing they are unlikely to be present to see those initiatives through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This feeling of being temporary can weigh heavily on someone accustomed to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### Strategic Considerations
Despite these drawbacks, contract positions can be a valuable [[contract_roles_as_a_strategic_career_move | strategic career move]], especially during a difficult job market or after a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. They provide an opportunity to continue income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, gain new skills or pivot into new industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, and even test-drive a company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For those recovering from a layoff, a contract can boost confidence and help re-establish a routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While weighing the [[pros_and_cons_of_contract_work_versus_fulltime_employment | pros and cons of contract work versus fulltime employment]] requires personal consideration based on market conditions and individual needs, contract roles can be a crucial step in a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

A recent poll indicated that this question causes significant concern for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding the Interviewer's Perspective

### The Hiring Manager's Business Problem
New positions are typically created to address a business gap or problem within a department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This could involve replacing a departing employee or fulfilling a new business need, leading to the creation of a new headcount and a business case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This process generates a requisition and job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### The Recruiter's Role
Before recruitment begins, recruiters conduct an "intake call" with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. During this call, they review job specifications, identify critical responsibilities, determine why the position is open, and ascertain the necessary skills for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This conversation allows the recruiter to create an "ideal candidate profile" that addresses the business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This business problem is the key to formulating your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## A Three-Part Formula for Your Answer

The question "Why should we hire you?" is most likely to come from the hiring manager during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. A three-part formula can help you [[key_elements_of_a_successful_interview_response | formulate a strong response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>:

### 1. Understand the Business Problem
The first step is to fully grasp why the position is open and what business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This could be due to a new project, a new skill set requirement, a new division launch, or insufficient bandwidth within the existing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

To identify this:
*   **Study the job description:** Pay close attention to key points and indicators of what the business seeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Listen to the recruiter:** During your preliminary screen, the recruiter will provide insights and "keys" about the role that can be used in the hiring manager interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Asking [[key_questions_to_ask_in_a_job_interview | questions of the recruiter]] can be very beneficial here.

### 2. Link Your Past Experiences to the Business Problem
Once you know the business problem, connect your past experiences and successes directly to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Frame your answer by explaining how you have already solved similar problems in previous roles, demonstrating a track record of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### 3. Show How You Can Solve the Problem for *Them*
Finally, articulate how you would apply your experience to solve *their* specific business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Provide specific examples or strategies on how you would approach the issues they face, enabling the interviewer to visualize you in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Many job seekers make the mistake of giving generic answers when asked "Why should we hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Avoid fluffy, unspecific statements like:
*   "I'm a team player." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%." (This is physically impossible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   "I'm a fast learner." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   "I achieve results." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'll jump into your team and hit the ground running." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

These phrases are generic and do not provide specific insight into your capabilities or how you would benefit the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Instead, focus on tying the business results you've achieved in the past to the company's current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

By understanding the business problem, linking your past successes, and demonstrating how you will solve their challenges, you can effectively answer "Why should we hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

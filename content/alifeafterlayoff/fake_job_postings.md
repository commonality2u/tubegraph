The job market is currently experiencing a rise in "ghost postings" or [[fake_job_postings_and_why_they_exist | fake job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These are job listings that an employer has no real intention of ever filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This phenomenon occurs amidst conflicting job market data, with reports of a robust market and record job openings, alongside major corporations announcing layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. While people are still finding employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, the employment pendulum has swung back to the employer, leading to practices like forcing people back into the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The increase in [[fake_job_postings_and_why_they_exist | ghost postings]] further complicates the job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Pipelining Requisitions

One type of ghost posting is a "pipelining wreck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is a requisition (req) posted by an employer with the sole goal of collecting resumes for a future date, without any current intention of filling the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The purpose is to have a head start when they do decide to recruit again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The optics surrounding these postings are considered shady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Many professionals, including the speaker, take exception to pipelining reqs due to the poor candidate experience they create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Job seekers, especially those who have been laid off, invest significant time crafting targeted and custom resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. They expect their applications to be genuinely considered for a job that an employer is actively trying to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Employers and talent acquisition leaders often "lose sight of the candidate experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In areas with limited job opportunities, job seekers can get very excited about a posting from a prominent local employer, only to spend a long time anxiously waiting for a response that will never come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

It is strongly advised that employers prioritize the candidate experience and remove these pipelining requisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Misleading Job Opening Data

The stated total number of job openings may be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Many of the "record number of jobs" being reported are likely contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that may not offer benefits and are generally not considered "career-type" jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This creates frustration for job seekers who are told the market is robust but cannot find suitable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The numbers may be "fudged" for various reasons, making the rise in [[fake_job_postings_and_why_they_exist | fake job postings]] even more frustrating and creating a "perfect storm" for the average job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Survey Insights on Ghost Jobs

A survey conducted by Clarify Capital between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, gathered data from 1045 managers involved in hiring about ghost jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Key findings include:
*   **Active Postings Duration** 68% of managers had job postings active for more than 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. While not super shocking for highly skilled positions (which can take 45-60 days to fill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, 1 in 10 hiring managers reported a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Such long-standing postings are considered "aging wrecks" and suggest issues like overly particular hiring managers, unique skill sets, or a lack of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Future Filling Plans** 1 in 5 managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. More surprisingly, 50% of managers keep job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The fact that employers are actively planning to fill jobs several months down the road is "head scratching" and might indicate ambiguous hiring plans or ties to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. If this is the case, the requisition should be pulled down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs

The most common reasons employers are not actively trying to fill a position, according to the survey:
*   **Always open to new people (50%)** They want to keep requisitions open to see who applies, essentially "window shopping" without a general intention to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated** This reason is particularly confusing, as tricking employees about job availability is unlikely to motivate them long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing** This practice is considered deceitful to both job candidates and investors, potentially having legal implications from an SEC perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. A company that engages in such deception is likely not a desirable place to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **The job was filled** If a job requisition is filled, it should be pulled down immediately, as there is no reason to keep it open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This points to lazy recruiting or HR practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates/applicants in case there is turnover** This is analogous to individuals always keeping their resumes updated and being open to new opportunities, as companies do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies** This indicates lazy and irresponsible recruiting, where the employer is passively waiting for an exceptional candidate rather than actively seeking one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **To placate overworked employees** This is "particularly sinister" because employers are misleading overwhelmed employees by suggesting help is coming when it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. If an employer consistently tells you help is coming but it never arrives, you might be a victim of ghost requisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Forgot to delete the job** This is simply a sign of a lazy recruiter or HR person, with no valid excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **No reason in particular/They simply don't care** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Avoiding Ghost Postings

To [[scam_job_postings_warning_signs | recognize red flags in job postings]] and avoid falling victim to a ghost requisition, consider the following:
*   **Posting Age** If a job posting has been active for over six months, there's a high chance it's a ghost requisition or an "aging wreck" with no intention of being filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Repeated Postings** If the same requisition is repeatedly posted over a long period, it indicates either a ghost job or a hiring manager who is indecisive or experiences high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. In any of these scenarios, it suggests a [[identifying_lowquality_job_postings | low-quality employer]] or role to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Company Due Diligence** Conduct reverse reference checks. Research if the company recently had major layoffs, especially if the current postings are for similar roles affected by the layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If they are trying to pipeline candidates for roles they recently eliminated, it shows a lack of loyalty to that position, making it a vulnerable and undesirable job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Job Description Detail** Carefully read the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. A high level of detail, with specifics about accomplishments, responsibilities, and support structures, indicates a more serious requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Generic, salesy descriptions with no specific role are often a big [[recognizing_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] for pipelining requisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Recency of Post** A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an active, legitimate requisition that an employer is actively recruiting for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

Job seekers should focus their efforts on high-quality roles with reputable employers and treat themselves as "true free agents" and "CEOs of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

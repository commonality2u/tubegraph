To advance in your career, it's essential to adopt a more "selfish" approach, viewing yourself as a free agent or the CEO of your own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This means always prioritizing your best interests, as no one else will consistently do so for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Why the Free Agent Mindset is Crucial

The traditional notion of corporate loyalty is effectively "dead," a relic of the Baby Boomer generation when working 20-40 years at the same company for a pension was common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Today's [[state_of_the_current_job_market | job market]] is characterized by instability and a "what have you done for me lately" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Volatility and Company Behavior
The last 6 to 8 months have seen a definitive softening in the labor market, with widespread layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, and a spillover into other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Companies have shown little improvement in treating employees with dignity and respect, especially regarding layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

An economic boom, where huge wage increases and widespread hiring occurred, particularly in tech, proved unsustainable, leading to a rapid downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This boom-and-bust cycle has become the new repeating cadence in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Egregious Layoff Examples
Many companies have handled layoffs in unprofessional and distasteful ways, highlighting the need for employees to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Google Employee:** A long-tenured employee was forced to return to the office, only to discover their badge no longer worked upon arrival, signaling their layoff without prior notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Business Trip Layoffs:** Individuals on company business trips were notified of their layoff mid-trip, leaving them stranded and embarrassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Layoff During Labor:** One individual was laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Short Tenure Layoffs:** Someone who left a previous company to join Google was laid off after only 13 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This highlights a lack of accountability for disrupting lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Zillow's Re-hiring:** Zillow laid off recruiting staff in late 2022 but soon began posting the same jobs, refusing to rehire those recently dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This demonstrates a lack of accountability and poor forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

These instances underscore that companies often view employees as "human resources" or numbers on a spreadsheet, eliminating positions without hesitation once usefulness diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

> "To a senior leader it may just look like a number, you may just be a line on a spreadsheet but there are people who have lives, they have families, they have mortgages, they have car payments and they have hopes and dreams and they took these jobs thinking that it would help them further their career to get to their end goal and that's all been wiped away..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>

## The Free Agent's Advantage: An Anecdote

Embracing the free agent mindset can lead to significant career and financial benefits.
Consider the story of an individual laid off in early November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. By promptly updating their resume, cleaning up their LinkedIn profile, and utilizing effective networking strategies to bypass recruiters, they secured multiple job offers within about five weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This individual accepted an offer with a nearly $50,000 raise from their previous employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Even after accepting, they were advised to continue with final interview rounds for another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Just a few days into their new job, this second opportunity presented an even stronger offer, a $30,000 to $40,000 increase, pushing their total compensation nearly $100,000 above their original layoff salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

The advice given was clear: "Act like a free agent and take the better opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This demonstrates that continuous exploration of opportunities, even after accepting a new role, can be beneficial, as employment can be terminated unexpectedly, as seen with the 13-week Google employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Practical Strategies for the Free Agent

To effectively act as a free agent in your career and [[navigating_the_competitive_job_market | navigate the competitive job market]]:

### Choose Companies Wisely
Hold companies accountable for their past behavior during hiring and layoff cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If a company has a history of poor conduct, reconsider giving them your services, as this is akin to casting a vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Assess how they behaved during the 2020 economic shifts and their current practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Asking the right questions during interviews ensures alignment with organizations that match your values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Maintain Continuous Engagement
You owe your employer an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, but no more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Always think for yourself and be selfish about your career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

*   **Resume:** A strong resume is crucial to be noticed by recruiters for a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Interview Training:** Developing strong interviewing skills is essential to sell yourself and secure an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **LinkedIn Optimization:** Set up your LinkedIn profile to be highly discoverable, allowing recruiters to find you directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This helps you avoid competing with hundreds of applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Staying in a single role or company for an extended period can present several risks to your career growth and earning potential. This is considered one of the "six brutal truths" about your career that individuals need to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### The Market Will Pass You By

One of the most significant risks of long-term employment in the same role is that "the market is inevitably going to pass you by" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This occurs because companies typically offer modest merit increases, often around 2-3% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. While these incremental raises accumulate, the external market value for the same skills and experience tends to outpace them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

For example, an individual who starts in an entry-level role and works for three to five years, receiving only merit increases, may find that a new hire fresh out of school is making the same or even more money for the same role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This disparity is attributed to the law of supply and demand in the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

#### Impact on [[salary_growth_through_job_transitions_versus_staying_in_the_same_role | Salary Growth]]

Staying in a role for too long can severely limit your [[salary_growth_through_job_transitions_versus_staying_in_the_same_role | salary growth]] potential. The primary ways to unlock significantly higher earning potential are:
*   **Promotion to a new band:** Being promoted into an entirely different job classification or band within the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Job Transition:** Leaving for a different organization, which can typically lead to a 10-15% jump in salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

It is crucial to time job transitions correctly, avoiding "dangerous moves" during periods of economic instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Lack of Personal Career Strategy

A significant number of people lack a clear career strategy, often choosing to "wing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. If you remain in a role expecting the company to eventually recognize and reward you, you are not [[acting_as_a_free_agent_in_your_career | acting like a free agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This approach can lead to the [[the_dangers_of_staying_in_a_comfortable_job | dangers of staying in a comfortable job]] and becoming complacent, rather than proactively managing your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

The individual who signs your paycheck holds the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. In the workplace, individuals are generally "relatively selfish," and this is not necessarily a negative trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. You should be selfish in your career and actively seek to better yourself, as no one else is responsible for your career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Conclusion

To mitigate the [[the_dangers_of_staying_in_a_comfortable_job | dangers of staying in a comfortable job]] and ensure [[long_term_job_stability_and_career_management | long term job stability and career management]], it is important to avoid remaining in a role for too long. Instead, individuals should [[acting_as_a_free_agent_in_your_career | act like a free agent]] and the CEO of their career, making strategic decisions to proactively manage their professional journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This includes being aware of market trends and seeking opportunities for promotion or external job transitions to enhance earning potential and prevent career stagnation.

In the context of employment ghosting, the roles of recruiters and hiring managers are crucial in shaping the candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Effective communication and streamlined processes are key to preventing candidates from being left in the dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Defining Employment Ghosting
Employment ghosting occurs when an employer or company representative moves a candidate into a formalized interviewing process but then fails to follow up on the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. It is considered poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Simply applying to a role and not receiving a response is not considered ghosting in this definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Recruiter Responsibilities

### Candidate Engagement & Follow-Up
*   **Initiating Contact:** Recruiters are responsible for initiating the interview process by contacting candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Closing the Loop:** A primary responsibility is to follow up with candidates and provide status updates on their applications, rather than leaving them in a "waiting game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Candidate Experience:** [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | Recruiters]] should prioritize a positive candidate experience by being organized and ensuring proper communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Internal Process Management
*   **Accountability:** Organizations like Amazon hold their [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | recruiters]] accountable with strict metrics around candidate experience, enforcing prompt follow-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. For example, Amazon has a "two and five promise": two days to respond after a hiring manager phone screen and five days after an on-site interview loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   **Driving Decisions:** [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | Recruiters]] are expected to push hiring teams to make efficient and decisive hiring decisions to meet response deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Candidate Submission:** A common metric for [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | recruiters]] is to send at least three interviewable candidates per job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Indecision:** [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | Recruiters]] should push back on [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] indecisiveness, especially when a [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] wants to see additional candidates after reviewing suitable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   **Closing Out Candidates:** Even if a requisition is closed or a candidate is hired, [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | recruiters]] should properly disposition and close out all remaining in-process candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Ideal Workload
> A [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | recruiter]] should ideally manage 15 to 25 requisitions (recs) at a time, depending on the industry and role complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Handling more than 25 can inevitably lead to candidate experience suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, with some organizations assigning 40 to 50 recs, doubling the workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Hiring Manager Responsibilities

### Timely Decision-Making
*   **Prompt Feedback:** [[Hiring manager biases in recruitment | Hiring managers]] are expected to provide quick answers and feedback to [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | recruiters]] regarding candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Indecisiveness:** [[Hiring manager biases in recruitment | Hiring managers]] should avoid "hemming and hawing" over candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a> and should make decisions rather than constantly requesting additional slates of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **Meeting Deadlines:** [[Hiring manager biases in recruitment | Hiring managers]] should adhere to promised timelines for getting back to [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | recruiters]], typically within 24 to 48 hours after a candidate submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

### Candidate Status Clarity
*   **Avoiding "Lukewarm" Status:** [[Hiring manager biases in recruitment | Hiring managers]] should refrain from instructing [[role_of_corporate_recruiters_in_hiring | recruiters]] to keep candidates "lukewarm" while they search for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. This means a decision should be made rather than stringing candidates along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

## Shared Challenges and Impact

### Poor Internal Processes
*   **Lack of Formalization:** Companies without formalized talent acquisition departments within HR often struggle with effective recruiting processes, leading to poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Technology:** Bad software that cannot handle the volume of applicants can also contribute to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Impact on Business
*   **Brand Reputation:** Poor candidate experience can negatively impact an employer's brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. As in Amazon's philosophy, if a candidate is treated poorly during an interview, they might choose not to be a customer of that company, which can affect the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Advice for Job Seekers
> If you believe you've been ghosted, sending a polite "nudge" to the recruiter after some time can prompt them to provide a status update or properly close out your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

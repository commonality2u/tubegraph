Feeling that something isn't quite right at work can be a significant sign that it's time to consider a job change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many individuals have participated in "the great resignation" over the past 18 months, indicating a widespread reevaluation of job roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. While various factors contribute to people leaving their jobs, a major catalyst is the presence of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## [[Recognizing_a_toxic_work_culture | Recognizing a Toxic Work Environment]]

A key indicator to quit your job as soon as possible is if your boss or co-workers are [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Working in a situation that is unhealthy for your mental state or physical wellness warrants serious consideration of leaving quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. If your boss meets the criteria of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic]] boss, it's crucial to assess if that environment is a sustainable long-term fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## [[Impact_of_a_toxic_workplace_on_mental_and_physical_health | Impact on Health and Well-being]]

A [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic]] boss or co-worker can negatively impact various aspects of your life, including upward mobility, work-life balance, sanity, and potentially your health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. The suffering of one's health as a result of a job is a critical sign to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

Working in a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace]] can lead to:
*   Physical manifestation of stress and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>
*   Sudden weight gain or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>
*   Affected temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>
*   Shifts in sleep cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>
*   Requiring medication because of your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>

There is no positive outcome to remaining in a job that negatively impacts your health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Holding off for a promotion is not a valid excuse to endure such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

## [[Impact_of_workplace_culture_and_politics_on_job_satisfaction | Job Satisfaction]] and the Dread of Mondays

A strong sense of dread when Monday morning arrives, and looking forward to weekends, are significant [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | signs]] that something is not right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Experiencing "the Sunday scaries" is a common indication of dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. If you look at your job with dread, it suggests you are not fully engaged or passionate about your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. While work often isn't exciting, an absolute inability to stand the idea of going to the office or logging in is a powerful indicator that you might be in the wrong job type, wrong company, or experiencing burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

## When to Make a Move

If you observe that all your co-workers are quitting, it's another clear sign that it might be time for you to update your resume and explore other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. The fact that multiple colleagues are leaving for seemingly happier roles with better pay suggests the grass might indeed be greener elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Life is too short, and the job market can be strong enough that there's no need to remain in a less than ideal situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. It's not worth staying in a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

[[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | Backdoor references]] are a practice where employers obtain information about a job candidate from individuals not provided as official references by the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This method can potentially [[predatory_hiring_practices | blacklist candidates]] from opportunities or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## How Backdoor References Occur
A backdoor reference typically happens when a member of the hiring team identifies someone who previously worked at the candidate's former company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This team member then contacts that individual directly to inquire about the candidate's performance or character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This process occurs behind the scenes, without the candidate's knowledge or consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Impact on Candidates
[[shady_practices_of_hr_departments | Backdoor references]] have been observed to "sink more than one candidate's chances" at an opportunity and potentially lead to them being blacklisted altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Candidates are unlikely to ever know if a backdoor reference negatively impacted their application because the interaction happens confidentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This practice is particularly common in smaller, interconnected industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

While not necessarily widespread, the speaker notes that some employers actively use [[characteristics_of_predatory_hiring_practices | "do not hire" lists]] that can be influenced by such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

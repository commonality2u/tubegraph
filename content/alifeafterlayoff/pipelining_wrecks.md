## Understanding Ghost Postings
A "ghost posting," also known as a "pipelining wreck," is a job advertisement listed by an employer with no immediate or real intention of filling the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. These are designed to collect resumes for potential future hiring needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Pipelining Wrecks
Companies use pipelining wrecks for several reasons, as revealed by a survey of 1045 managers involved in hiring (conducted August 31st to September 1st, 2022, by Clarify Capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>:
*   **Always open to new people** (50% of managers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>: Companies keep requisitions open to browse potential candidates, like "window shopping" for talent, without an immediate hiring intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>: Employers maintain a candidate pool in anticipation of future turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>: This suggests a passive, lazy recruiting approach where companies are only interested if an exceptional candidate appears without effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **To placate overworked employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>: A particularly "sinister" reason, where companies falsely indicate that help is on the way to alleviate current employees' workload, when no such hiring is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>: This tactic is deceitful to both job candidates and potential investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   **The job was filled** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>: This indicates a lack of diligence by recruiters or HR in taking down filled postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   **Forgot to delete the job** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>: A clear sign of lazy recruiting or HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **No reason in particular** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>: Some companies simply do not care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

### Statistics on Active Postings
*   68% of surveyed managers had job postings active for over 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. While typical time-to-fill for highly skilled positions can be 45-60 days, this is not shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   One in ten hiring managers has a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. These "aging wrecks" often signal issues like a picky hiring manager, a unique skill set, or a lack of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   One in five managers did not plan to fill open positions until the following year (2023, based on a 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   50% of managers keep job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers
Pipelining wrecks create a poor candidate experience, especially in a job market with many laid-off individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Job seekers invest significant time tailoring resumes and applications, only to find the employer has no intention of hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This can be frustrating, especially when official data claims a "robust" job market with a "record number of job openings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, which may be misleading due to the prevalence of contract, part-time, or seasonal roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Companies that utilize ghost postings are considered low-quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. If an employer is deceptively listing jobs to placate [[understanding_work_redistribution_as_a_warning_sign|overworked employees]] or give a false impression of growth, it indicates a company you likely wouldn't want to work for anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

## How to Identify and Avoid Ghost Postings
Job seekers can take steps to identify and avoid falling victim to ghost postings:
*   **Check posting date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>: If a job has been up for six months or repeatedly reposted over a long period, it's likely a ghost wreck or indicates issues with the hiring manager or high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
*   **Conduct reverse reference checks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>: Research if the company recently had major layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. If the posted positions match those recently affected by layoffs, the company might be [[hiring_practices_like_pipelining_and_internal_recruitment|pipelining]] for future hires, showing a lack of loyalty to those roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   **Analyze the job description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>: Legitimate postings have detailed descriptions outlining specific accomplishments, responsibilities, and reporting structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. Generic, salesy, or vague descriptions are major red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   **Consider recency of the post** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>: A job posted within the last week is more likely to be a genuine, actively recruiting position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

Recruiters extensively use LinkedIn to find and source candidates, often preferring it over open job posts which can be "too untargeted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. On the recruiter's side, there is a demand from hiring managers to find very targeted candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## How Recruiters Search

LinkedIn operates with two separate sites or logins: the front-facing site familiar to users and "LinkedIn Recruiter," a back-channel system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Anything placed in a LinkedIn profile can be searched through keywords or filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Boolean Searching

Recruiters use a powerful feature called "Boolean search" within LinkedIn Recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This allows them to use search strings to find specific combinations of skill sets, saving time by not having to manually look through hundreds or thousands of profiles for an exact fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This is an advanced search strategy for recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Optimizing Your Profile with Keywords

Recruiters use a string of keywords tied together to look for very specific or targeted profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. If a LinkedIn profile does not contain these specific keywords, it will not appear in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

To increase visibility for recruiters, it is recommended to load your LinkedIn profile with all the keywords a recruiter might be looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The more keywords added, the easier it is for recruiters to find your profile and the more likely you are to be contacted for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The specific keywords to add depend on the industry and the types of positions that are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. It is best to stay informed about your industry to identify major skills and add them to your profile if you possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

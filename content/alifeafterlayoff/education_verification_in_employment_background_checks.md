After receiving a job offer, companies typically conduct a background check, which often includes verifying educational claims made on a job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This process aims to confirm that candidates possess the credentials they claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## What is Verified?
Education verification involves confirming that an applicant actually attended the schools or obtained the degrees and certifications they listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This can include:
*   High school attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   College degrees claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   Professional certifications (e.g., CPA licenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

If a candidate claims to be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) but does not hold a CPA license, this discrepancy will be flagged during the background check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## How Education is Verified
Employers often outsource the [[employment_background_check_process | background check process]] to a third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For education verification, this third party will directly contact the universities or institutions listed on the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This process is generally quick because educational institutions are accustomed to receiving such requests from employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Importance of Accuracy
It is crucial to be honest about all claims made on a job application, including educational details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. A job application is considered a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Consequences of Discrepancies
If the information provided on the job application does not match the findings of the background check, it can lead to severe consequences:
*   **Offer Withdrawal**: A discrepancy can result in the immediate withdrawal of a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Termination**: Even after being hired, if an employer later discovers that an employee [[risks_of_falsifying_information_on_job_applications | falsified information]] or does not possess the claimed credentials, they can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

It is strongly advised against [[risks_of_falsifying_information_on_job_applications | falsifying]] any information submitted to an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Being forthcoming with one's background and ensuring all stated credentials are accurate is the recommended approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

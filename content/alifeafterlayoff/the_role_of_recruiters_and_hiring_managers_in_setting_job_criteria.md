Job seekers often feel that employer requirements are unrealistic, a sentiment backed by the existence of [[hidden_job_requirements_and_biases_in_hiring | hidden job requirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article explores how job criteria are set, highlighting the dynamics between [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiters]] and [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring managers]], and the impact of these criteria on the job market.

## Origin of Job Criteria

The process of defining job requirements typically begins with the [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. When a job requisition opens, the [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring manager]] and [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiter]] collaborate, often in an "intake call," to outline the role's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

During this session, they discuss:
*   **Must-haves (Requirements)**: These are usually straightforward, such as total years of experience, degree requirements, or core expertise (e.g., software development skills for a software developer role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Nice-to-haves (Preferred)**: This is where criteria become more flexible and can reveal [[hidden_job_requirements_and_biases_in_hiring | hiring manager bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Exclusions**: Specific characteristics or experiences the [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring manager]] wishes to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

While job seekers often blame [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiters]] for biases, these often originate from the [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring manager]] or the team responsible for hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiter]] then takes these requirements, including any embedded [[hidden_job_requirements_and_biases_in_hiring | biases]], to the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Recruiter's Role and Challenges

A competent [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiter]] should challenge the [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring manager]] on unrealistic demands, indicating that such criteria will [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | eliminate many good candidates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. However, this pushback doesn't always occur, especially with junior [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiters]] who may lack sufficient knowledge of job profiles or market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Case Study: Secret Internal Selection Guidelines

An accidental email from a [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiter]] revealed "secret internal selection guidelines" for a software development role, illustrating extreme [[hidden_job_requirements_and_biases_in_hiring | hidden job requirements]] and biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This internal memo, intended for the [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiter]] and not the job candidate, outlines specific preferences and exclusions that diverge significantly from public job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### What They Are Looking For

The guidelines stipulated candidates must possess:
*   **Education**: A bachelor's or master's degree in computer science from a "top program" like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, or University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. A special exception might be made for 4.0 graduates from other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Experience**: 4 to 10 years of software development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Candidates with fewer years, regardless of genius, would be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Technical Expertise**: Proficiency in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), sometimes Kotlin, and knowledge of AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Role**: A minimum of two years in each previous role; "job hoppers" were not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Those affected by layoffs or company closures were not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Company Background**: Significant experience in notable startups, especially those backed by Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **No Large Company Only Experience**: Candidates with only large company experience (e.g., Google, Facebook) would be rejected, as they were believed not to understand startup coding environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Citizenship**: Must be a US citizen, permanent resident, green card holder, or Canadian citizen, with no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This is a common requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Diversity**: Black and female candidates were listed as a "bonus" for diversity hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Founder Experience**: Bonus points for being a founding engineer or having founder experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### What to Avoid

The [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | hiring manager]] also listed types of candidates to avoid:
*   **Visa Candidates**: No visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Career Contractors**: Candidates with any contract work in their background were not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Job Hoppers**: Frequent short stints in roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Coding Boot Camp Graduates**: Graduates from coding boot camps like Full Stack Academy or Hacked Reactor were explicitly excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Consulting Background**: Those from IT software development firms (consulting) rather than companies producing direct products were not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Limited Big Company Experience**: Candidates with experience limited *only* to big companies (e.g., Uber, Intel) were rejected unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Fake Profiles**: [[recruitment_and_hiring_process_errors | Recruiters]] were instructed to screen carefully for fake or scam profiles, which are increasingly common due to AI mass applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Blacklisted Companies**: Candidates who had *ever* worked at companies like Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell were deemed "scarlet-lettered" and would "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers

While the extreme nature of this example is unusual, it reflects a reality in the job market where many companies maintain unrealistic [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles | hidden requirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Job seekers' frustration with such demands is justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

These extensive and often contradictory wish lists significantly [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | hinder a recruiter's ability to find qualified candidates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Companies with such demanding criteria may perpetually struggle to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

For job seekers, it's advised not to internalize the blame for rejections due to such [[recruitment_and_hiring_process_errors | unrealistic employer expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Instead, focus on presenting a clean, direct resume, engaging in targeted networking, and showcasing skills through portfolios or GitHub if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Ultimately, not applying to positions from "low-quality employers" with unfeasible demands can help reclaim control in one's career and compel companies to adjust their hiring approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

A viral TikTok video detailing a toxic interaction between an employee and her boss sparked a discussion about how to interpret and navigate such situations in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The case involves an employee named Alisson who posted about her experience with a new manager, leading to her eventual layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This scenario prompts an examination of whether the core issue lies with a toxic boss, a toxic company, a toxic human resources department, or a toxic employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Many individuals will likely encounter a confrontational or [[navigating_toxic_work_environments | toxic work environment]] with a boss at some point in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. A common issue is that many bosses are placed into their roles without adequate skill or competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Regardless, there are effective and less effective ways to conduct oneself in a professional setting, especially for those who are career-minded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## [[Signs of a problematic boss | Red Flags with New Bosses]]

When a new manager is brought into an organization, particularly from outside, they often arrive with their own preconceived notions of what constitutes effective work, drawing from their prior experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This includes their ideas about team structure, desired competencies, and priorities for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. If a new boss was not directly involved in an employee's hiring process, it can be a significant [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. In such cases, it is advisable to update one's resume, build professional networks, and begin exploring other job opportunities, as there is considerable unpredictability in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is especially true if a new senior leader, two or three layers up, intends to reorganize the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Employee Actions in Conflict

In the case study, the employee, Alisson, took on half of her former manager's responsibilities during a transition but felt she was making less money than when she started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. She expressed frustration that her new manager avoided her, told her to find answers elsewhere, and kept her Outlook calendar hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

When the employee took a week off, the manager did not ensure proper coverage for her duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Upon returning to "utter chaos," Alisson emailed the director expressing concern about the lack of coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This action of going around her boss to a senior leader, combined with previous complaints to HR, likely contributed to the manager's agitated reaction during their subsequent meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

The speaker noted that the manager likely had communication issues and didn't manage team emails effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. However, Alisson's actions of "delegating upward" by trying to assign tasks to her boss and expressing frustration to her manager were perceived as disrespectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. In a confrontational situation, an employee should attempt to de-escalate rather than continue to argue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. When an employee engages combatively with a manager, it can be perceived as disrespectful and make the situation worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

## The Role of Human Resources and Legal Recourse

It is a common misconception that human resources (HR) acts as an employee's advocate or the "police of the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. In reality, HR primarily protects the company's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. When an employee complains to HR, it can put a target on their back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. HR will typically review the employee's file for any performance issues and then speak with senior leadership and the manager in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Unless there is concrete evidence of discrimination, emotional complaints may result in the employee being viewed as the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is generally employee-focused and operates under the principle that the employer is "guilty until proven innocent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. If the EEOC declines to investigate a case further, it strongly suggests that the employee has no legal basis for their claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Discrimination claims require specific instances where the employer's actions are explicitly linked to protected characteristics, rather than general unfair treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Recording Workplace Conversations

Recording a manager without their knowledge or consent, and then posting it publicly (e.g., on TikTok), can lead to serious legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. It is crucial to obtain verbal permission from the other person before recording any conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

## Impact of Publicizing Workplace Disputes

Publicly broadcasting workplace grievances, especially on professional platforms like LinkedIn, can severely damage an individual's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. This act, described as "scarlet lettering" oneself, makes future employers, recruiters, and hiring teams view the individual as a "toxic candidate" or "toxic employee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. It can significantly hinder job prospects, as companies are unlikely to hire someone who has publicly criticized a former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## [[Handling bad work situations gracefully | Key Takeaways for Employees]]

- **Assess the situation objectively:** Avoid a victimhood mentality where the employer is always seen as bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.
- **Recognize when a relationship is deteriorating:** If a relationship with a manager becomes turbulent and confrontational, it's often a sign that the situation will not improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
- **De-escalate conflicts:** When a manager becomes agitated, the employee should try to de-escalate the situation and end the conversation respectfully, rather than continuing to argue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
- **Avoid "delegating upward":** Do not try to assign tasks or responsibilities to your boss, especially when they are already agitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
- **Understand HR's role:** HR is not an employee's friend; complaining to them can put the employee on the company's "radar" as a potential problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

- **Prioritize your career:** Do not allow one [[types_of_bad_bosses_in_the_workplace | bad boss]] or [[navigating_toxic_work_environments | toxic work environment]] to derail your entire career by engaging in public disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

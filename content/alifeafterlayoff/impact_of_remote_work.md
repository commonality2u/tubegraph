The shift to remote work has had a significant impact on the global workforce, contributing to a phenomenon known as the "Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This period, marked by mass voluntary job departures, has been influenced by global events over the past 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A survey by Microsoft indicated that up to 41% of currently working individuals planned to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In April 2021, a record four million people in the U.S. voluntarily quit their jobs, ushering in this "Great Resignation" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Shifting Perceptions of Work

Prior to the pandemic, remote work often carried a stigma, with perceptions that remote employees were less dedicated, worked less hard, or were not fully part of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, personal experience suggests that individuals in remote roles often work more hours than those in office settings, partly due to the elimination of commute time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. For instance, a daily commute could consume four and a half to five hours, driven by the perceived need for "face time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. While there is value in in-person interactions for building relationships that Zoom calls cannot fully replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, many found that the work itself could easily be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### The Pandemic's Influence

The COVID-19 pandemic forced many companies to rapidly adapt to a remote work model, even those previously resistant to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This sudden shift revealed that a significant number of positions, particularly white-collar, professional-level jobs, could effectively be performed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While some roles, like factory or transportation jobs, still require physical presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, the majority of office-based work proved adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

The pandemic also brought unexpected challenges, such as widespread school closures and the sudden need for homeschooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This situation highlighted which companies were flexible and accommodating versus those that were rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Employee Priorities and Employer Responses

After months of remote work, employees began to [[remote_work_vs_commuting | recalibrate their priorities]], questioning the necessity of the traditional office model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Despite this, some CEOs and leadership teams, including those in financial services like JPMorgan, began requiring employees to return to the office, often without a clear business reason beyond "face time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Another contentious issue is the practice of reducing salaries for employees who relocate from high-cost-of-living areas (e.g., New York City) to lower-cost regions while performing the same job remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This practice is viewed by some as punitive, especially since companies save on office space and associated expenses when employees work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### The New Competitive Landscape

The current job market often favors employees, particularly at the hourly level, but also significantly in professional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Companies that maintain rigid philosophies on return-to-office mandates and offer limited flexibility are struggling to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

Remote work and flexibility, once a competitive advantage, are now becoming a standard expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Recruiters observe that candidates are increasingly prioritizing remote work options and work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Companies that are unwilling to adapt to blended or remote models may face a [[job_market_implications_of_reduced_remote_work_opportunities | competitive disadvantage in recruitment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Employee Burnout and Overload

During 2020-2021, many companies overcorrected by implementing deep layoffs, anticipating a greater impact on their business than actually occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. When the market recovered faster than expected, the remaining employees absorbed a significant amount of additional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This increased workload, combined with the constant "digital overloading" from virtual meetings (Teams, Zoom calls), led to widespread digital burnout and a lack of genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This exhaustion contributed to the "Great Resignation," as many employees felt fed up with inflexible leaders and unsustainable workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. A significant portion of individuals seeking career coaching are those who are gainfully employed but dissatisfied with their current roles and unwilling to tolerate "antiquated thought processes and business practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## The Future of [[workplace_culture_shifts_during_the_pandemic | Employee Experience]]

Moving forward, companies must prioritize the "employee experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes people's work and lives, including productivity, flexibility, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. To remain competitive in the labor market, companies need to offer:
*   Clear career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
*   Work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
*   Full-time employment over contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
*   [[influence_of_remote_work_dynamics | Flexible work arrangements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>
*   Competitive financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>

The past 18 months, despite their challenges, have led to a redefinition of priorities for individuals in the workforce, forcing companies to adapt. This shift is ultimately viewed as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

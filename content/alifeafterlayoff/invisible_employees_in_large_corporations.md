The tragic death of a Wells Fargo employee at her desk, unnoticed for several days, highlights the concerning issue of invisible employees within large corporate structures and the potential impact of [[corporate_practices_and_employee_loyalty | corporate culture]].

## Case Study: Denise Prudhome at Wells Fargo

On August 16th, a Friday, 60-year-old Denise Prudhome entered her Wells Fargo office building in Tempe, Arizona, at 7:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> This was a corporate office building, not a branch location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Four days later, on August 20th, building security called officials about a "subject down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. An employee found Prudhome dead in her cubicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead at 4:55 p.m., suggesting she had likely been deceased for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Her cubicle was located on the third floor, away from the main aisle, in an "off the beaten path" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Multiple people had complained of a foul odor, assuming it was due to plumbing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This meant she went unnoticed, decomposing for four full days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Lack of Oversight

Employees expressed heartbreak and concern, wondering if anyone would check on them if they were in a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The lack of awareness from colleagues, managers, or even janitorial staff was striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. No one seemed to notice her absence from meetings, missed reports, or simply not being seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The speaker questioned the value of her work if her absence went unnoticed for so long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Company Response

A Wells Fargo spokesman expressed deep sadness and offered thoughts and prayers to the family, stating that counselors were available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The company also stated full cooperation with the police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It was presumed she experienced a health event at her desk, with no foul play suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Implications of Corporate Culture

The incident raises questions about the [[corporate_practices_and_employee_loyalty | corporate culture]] at Wells Fargo and similar companies, particularly regarding communication and employee well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. It's noted as particularly ironic because the finance industry, including companies like Wells Fargo, has been insistent on employees returning to the office for "collaboration" and to experience [[corporate_practices_and_employee_loyalty | corporate office culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In this case, no collaboration or even basic human interaction seemed to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The speaker emphasized that someone in management should be held [[importance_of_company_accountability_in_hiring_and_layoffs | accountable]] for failing to notice an employee was in the building and had not left for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Lessons for Employees and Employers

This event serves as a stark reminder for employees:

*   **Seek Appreciation:** If you feel [[identifying_low_quality_employers | underappreciated]] in your current role, actively seek a workplace that values your presence and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Health and Wellness:** Your health and wellness should always come first. Take sick days and vacations without guilt, as you never know when your last day might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control of Your Career:** In many large corporations, employees can feel like "a cog in a wheel" or "a number on a spreadsheet," to the extent that their absence might go unnoticed even in extreme circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It is crucial to "act like the CEO of your career" because no one else is solely looking out for your well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

An unusual job application form, shared on LinkedIn by a talent acquisition manager, highlights the importance of recognizing [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | red flags]] in the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This specific incident involved an international company recruiting for a US-based remote role, necessitating adherence to US laws despite the company's origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Red Flags in Recruitment Practices

When evaluating job opportunities, several factors can indicate a potentially disreputable or fraudulent employer. Being aware of these can help job seekers avoid [[predatory_job_postings_and_scams_on_linkedin | employment scams]].

### HR vs. Talent Acquisition
If a large corporation's recruitment is handled directly by its Human Resources department rather than a specialized Talent Acquisition department, it can be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While common in localized settings like factories, this practice for large corporations may suggest a "scammy role" or a lower-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Lack of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
A company that sends manual forms for completion instead of utilizing an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or an online application portal is another significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Financial Demands
Job seekers should be extremely wary if an employer asks them to cash checks or pay for anything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This is a common tactic in many [[strategies_to_identify_and_avoid_fake_job_postings | employment scams]].

### Vetting Opportunities
It is crucial to vet any opportunity by cross-referencing information with the company's corporate website and verifying that real people work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Illegal and Invasive Interview Questions

The application form discussed in this case included numerous questions that are illegal under US anti-discrimination laws. These questions have no bearing on an applicant's ability to perform the job and are designed to elicit protected information. Spotting these can be a clear sign of a [[misleading_promises_by_employers | low-quality employer]] or a scam.

### Marital Status
Asking about civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, or having a significant other) is completely illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It has no relevance to job performance and can lead to legal issues for the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Parental Status and Childcare
Inquiring whether an applicant has children, how many minors they have, or if they have childcare arrangements during working hours is highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Employers have been known to discriminate against individuals with children, fearing they might take more time off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Discrimination based on family status or pregnancy is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
A legal way to address potential scheduling conflicts is to ask if an applicant can meet specific schedule requirements, rather than asking about their family situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Nationality and Origin
Asking about passports held, nationality, country of birth, or country of origin is illegal in the US as it seeks to disclose national origin, a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This information has no bearing on job ability, assuming the applicant is legally permitted to work in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
Legally, an employer can ask: "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. While questions about passport validity might be valid for roles requiring international travel, direct questions about nationality are problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Age
Requesting an applicant's age for an application in the United States is completely illegal due to ageism discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Religion
Asking about an applicant's religion, especially if it has changed since birth, is illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Religion is a protected class, and employers cannot discriminate based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Height and Weight
While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight requirements can be viewed as illegal under federal law if they disproportionately limit opportunities for protected groups and are not clearly job-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Many states and municipalities specifically prohibit discrimination based on height and weight unless it's a genuine job requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Medical Conditions
Inquiring about medical conditions, medications, medical history, or upcoming surgeries is highly invasive and generally illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

This extreme example of an application form highlights [[gaslighting_and_predatory_practices_by_employers | predatory practices]] and what constitutes illegal questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Such employers are either unprofessional, attempting a scam, or trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. All these scenarios are red flags and should lead job seekers to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Job seekers should keep their "radar up" for these red flags in applications or interviews to focus on high-quality employers and prevent falling victim to [[employer_strategies_behind_fake_job_listings | employment scams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Crafting a strong resume, maintaining a good LinkedIn presence, and having a solid [[job_application_pitfalls_and_tips | job search strategy]] are essential for navigating [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | the job market]] and identifying legitimate opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

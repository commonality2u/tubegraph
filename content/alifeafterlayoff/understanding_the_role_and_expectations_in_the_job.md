Asking questions during a job interview is crucial for job seekers, as it demonstrates engagement and curiosity to the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Beyond satisfying the interviewer, candidates should use this opportunity to screen the company and the role, ensuring it aligns with their career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Being selective about job roles is important, as a poor fit can negatively impact one's career for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The most effective candidates actively interview the company as much as they are being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Key Questions to Ask the Hiring Manager

While candidates don't need to ask every question, they should select those most pertinent to their situation and be prepared to ask them when the interviewer offers the chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The goal is to learn about the opportunity before accepting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Understanding the Role's Genesis
*   **"Why is this position open?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> This question offers insight into the department's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   If the previous person was terminated or laid off, it indicates potential issues to investigate further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. In such cases, ask specific follow-up questions like "Why did they get terminated?" or "What things were they not successful in?" to gather reconnaissance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   If the previous person quit, inquire "Why did they quit the job?" and assess if the reasons for their dissatisfaction align with your expectations for the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   If it's a new headcount, it's often a positive sign of departmental or company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Vision and Contribution
*   **"What is your vision for this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> This helps understand the hiring manager's long-term vision and why the position was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Asking this early can give you an advantage, allowing you to tailor your subsequent answers to align with their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **"What's one weakness that you currently have in your department?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> This helps determine where you might fit in and if your skill set aligns with their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. You can also ask about the department's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **"How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> This allows you to decide whether you align well with their proposed contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Measuring Success and Expectations
*   **"How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> This ensures that the expectations are reasonable and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If the hiring manager has unrealistic expectations, it's an opportunity to push back and clarify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Understanding this helps determine if it's a good cultural fit, preventing a situation where you are set up to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Learning from Predecessors
*   **"What is it about that person that made them so successful in this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> If the previous person was promoted, listening to the answer provides a roadmap for your own success in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Long-Term Growth and Career Path
*   **"Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> It's reasonable to understand your long-term career path and ensure the role isn't a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Ensure you show strong interest in the role you are currently interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Assessing Leadership Style
*   **"What would you describe your leadership style as?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> or **"If I was to go out into your department and ask some of your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> Vetting your potential boss is essential to ensure their leadership style aligns with your needs for a long-term fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This helps understand the type of boss you'll be working for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Gauging Organizational Strategy
*   **"How is this company planning to address [competitor's new product/process/idea] and stay in front of the market?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> Before the interview, research the company's competitors and any industry-shaking technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This question helps understand the organization's strategic direction, ensuring longevity and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. A reputable company should be aware of competitors and have a strategic plan; lack thereof is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Uncovering Underlying Concerns
*   **"If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> Listening closely to the answer provides valuable insight into what is truly happening behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## General Interview Tips
*   Don't wait until the end of the interview to ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Engage the interviewer throughout the process to foster a two-way dialogue, which often leads to a more successful interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

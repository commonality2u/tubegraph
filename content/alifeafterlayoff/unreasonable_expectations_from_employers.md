Employers sometimes present job requirements and conditions that are so unrealistic or absurd, they serve as significant "red flags" for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Recognizing these [[questions_that_indicate_low_quality_employers | indicators of low-quality employers]] is crucial for job seekers to [[challenges_of_relying_on_an_employer | value themselves]] and avoid applying for [[challenges_with_unrealistic_job_postings | garbage job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These situations highlight [[challenges_with_job_application_processes_and_employer_expectations | challenges with job application processes and employer expectations]] and can lead to [[consequences_of_unrealistic_salary_expectations | negative career outcomes]] if not identified.

## Examples of Unreasonable Expectations

### Extremely Low Pay for High Qualifications
Some employers offer wages significantly below market rate for positions requiring extensive experience and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Accounting Role**: A remote accounting position was advertised for $1,400 a month, which equates to $8.75 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This role required two years of accounting experience with US-based businesses and a Bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The pay is below minimum wage in some areas and considered poverty level, making it impossible to pay off student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. An entry-level accounting job should realistically pay between $45,000 and $50,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Penalties and Fees for Employees
Some employers attempt to charge employees for various "costs" associated with employment, especially upon departure.
*   **Restaurant Employee Handbook**: An employee handbook detailed a series of charges to be deducted from an employee's final pay if they left the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. These included a $10 fee for the handbook, a training manual fee, file processing fees, payroll processing fees, W-2 processing fees, uniform costs (e.g., $12 for a t-shirt), a training cost of $25 per day, and even a hiring processing cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Such practices are unheard of in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> and indicate an anti-employee stance, likely stemming from negative past experiences with high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Unrealistic Interview and Application Demands
Employers sometimes impose arbitrary and unreasonable conditions during the hiring process.
*   **Punctuality Penalty**: An applicant was rejected from a full-time job because they arrived "exactly on time" for their interview, rather than earlier, which the recruiter considered a lack of keenness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. While arriving a few minutes early is often recommended for a candidate's benefit, denying a job for arriving precisely on time is an "absolute most ridiculous reason to reject somebody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Unpaid Work or Consultative Services
Requiring candidates to perform unpaid work as part of the interview process is a major red flag.
*   **Unpaid "Test" Work**: A hiring manager asked a candidate to "come in and work for a couple of hours to see if you like the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. When the candidate asked if they would be paid, the manager refused, stating it was "for you to get a feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, and then passive-aggressively withdrew the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. No reputable company would put someone through an unpaid test work day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Free Intellectual Property**: Companies may ask candidates to complete complex projects, case studies, or presentations that address actual business scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. If uncompensated, this is a way for companies to get free consultative services and potentially implement the candidate's ideas without hiring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Job seekers should be reluctant to complete such projects unless compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Misleading Salary Transparency
While some states require salary ranges, employers sometimes use extremely wide ranges to be deceptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   **Vast Salary Range**: A large tech company posted a base salary range of $150,000 to $890,000, a spread of over $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This tactic, often seen in [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers | pay transparency states]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, doesn't help job seekers and indicates a "shady" and "dishonest" character from the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Unrelated Job Duties and "Jack-of-All-Trades" Roles
Some job postings combine highly specialized professional duties with unrelated manual labor.
*   **Website Developer & Landscaper**: A position for a "Website Business Developer" advertised for $25 Canadian an hour (less in US dollars) required candidates to help redevelop website advertising and promote eco-friendly landscape services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Up to 50% of the job could involve physical labor for landscaping and snow removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. This full-time job was also an 8-16 week contract position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This indicates a "mom and pop" operation expecting one person to cover multiple, disparate roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

### Impossible Internship Requirements
Internship postings sometimes demand qualifications typically expected of seasoned professionals, not students.
*   **Highly Experienced Intern**: A four-month student internship starting in September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, expected the intern to work as an "industry expert with analytical skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, collaborate with data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, and have advanced knowledge of insurance and wealth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Beyond a post-secondary education, they also sought candidates with professional designations like CPA, CFA, or CSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. These [[employer_expectations_for_recent_college_graduates | expectations for recent college graduates]] or interns are "so skewed from reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

### Bizarre Application Demands
Some application processes include completely irrelevant and intrusive requests.
*   **Fridge Photo**: An application asked for a photo of the inside of the applicant's fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. This type of request is a "red flag" and suggests a "cumbersome interview process" at best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Job seekers should avoid complying with such irrelevant requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags
These unreasonable expectations often stem from:
*   **Lack of Business Acumen**: Especially in startups, founders may lack experience in HR, leadership, or hiring processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Absence of HR/TA Department**: Smaller companies or startups may lack a dedicated Human Resources or Talent Acquisition department, leading to unchecked and "ridiculous requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Rogue Recruiters or Hiring Managers**: Sometimes, individuals within a company may have unrealistic expectations or try to be "cute" with unconventional requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

## Implications for Job Seekers
Encountering these unreasonable expectations in job postings is a favor to the job seeker, as it openly identifies "low quality employers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Working for such "red flag" or "toxic" employers is unlikely to lead to career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. It's crucial for job seekers to maintain self-respect, understand their worth, and avoid accepting positions with companies that exhibit these signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. The worst scenario is when a red flag employer doesn't reveal their true nature until after one has started working for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

Job seekers often encounter "cringe-worthy" or "scary" job postings that indicate a [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory]] approach by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These "low quality employers" get away with these practices only when applicants accept their terms and offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Arming oneself with the necessary skills and interview techniques can help avoid settling for such opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags in Job Postings

One significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] is a salary offered that is significantly higher than the market rate for a similar position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This often indicates that the employer needs to dangle an "extreme incentive" to attract candidates to an undesirable work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Examples of Predatory Hiring Practices

### Excessive Monitoring and Productivity Tracking

Some fully remote positions employ intrusive tracking software, including productivity and keyword tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This software can monitor keystrokes, mouse clicks, and even take pictures via camera every 30 seconds to enforce a "standard of productivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. If activity stops, a "productivity coach" (manager) will call to review "wasted time" and suggest efficiency improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Such environments may even penalize basic needs like restroom breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Unpaid or Underpaid Positions

Companies may post positions, especially in high-cost-of-living areas, as "temporary non-paid positions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. These roles often come with significant responsibilities and required skills, but offer no compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Such postings may be illegal under Department of Labor regulations, which require specific criteria for unpaid internships to be legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This is seen as a [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory opportunity]] where companies seek to take advantage of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Another example is demanding high qualifications for extremely low pay, such as a software development role requiring a bachelor's degree in computer science and five years of development and IT experience, but offering only $11 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This wage is significantly less than a quarter of the market rate for such experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Overly Complex and Demanding Application Processes

Some companies implement "obnoxious" and "robust screening processes" that are tone-deaf to the current job market, which is often a "seller's market" for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Examples include:
*   Requiring resumes in a specific format sent to an email address (indicating no Applicant Tracking System) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Demanding a LinkedIn connection request as a mandatory step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Assigning "homework" such as reading articles or watching videos about the company before a first interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Requiring candidates to match their availability to the recruiting director's schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   Demanding a text message confirmation to a personal phone number about technical readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   Providing extensive, complex instructions for the interview process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
These processes often contradict the very principles of efficiency and agility the roles might entail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Extensive, Uncompensated Project Assignments

For second-round interviews, some companies ask candidates to complete projects that require a significant time investment, such as six to eight hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is often for entry-level or rotational management programs with no guarantee of advancing to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This practice is criticized as a "waste of everybody's time" for unselected candidates and demonstrates a lack of respect for applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Self-respecting employers typically avoid such demands unless for highly senior positions where presenting a business idea is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Unstable Startup Opportunities

Startups may post jobs explicitly stating they are "not for people who need a stable and well-paying job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. They admit to financial instability, with salaries "slightly below market rates" and a reliance on future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. These roles often require long hours, high levels of education (e.g., doctoral degrees), and promise only intangible rewards like contributing to a "massive impact project" or a "nice dinner" if funding is secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Management may be inexperienced and unable to provide mentorship or clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Insulting Application Requirements

For even part-time, contract positions with average pay, some employers demand highly specific and demeaning cover letter instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This can include:
*   Strict paragraph and sentence counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   Essays on perceived job qualities and personal motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   A mandatory closing sentence that confirms the applicant has read and followed all instructions, implying a lack of basic intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

These examples highlight various characteristics of [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory hiring practices]] that job seekers should be aware of and avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

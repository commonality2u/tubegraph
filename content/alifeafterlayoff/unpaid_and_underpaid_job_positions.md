Many job postings circulating online can be considered "cringe-worthy opportunities" due to their poor quality and exploitative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These "predatory" practices by hiring managers and companies can only persist if job seekers accept their unfavorable terms of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Arming oneself with the skills to effectively sell oneself in an interview can help avoid having to settle for such "utter garbage" postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | Identifying Low-Quality Job Postings]]

Several red flags can indicate a low-quality or exploitative job opportunity:

*   **Unusually High Salaries** A salary that is significantly higher than what competitors or the rest of the market pays for similar positions can be a warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Companies may offer an "extreme incentive" to entice candidates to work in undesirable environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This often points to a deeper [[reason_for_job_position_being_open | reason for the position being open]] or issues within the company culture.
*   **Excessive Pre-Interview Assessments** Some companies require multiple hours of assessments with no guarantee of even a preliminary interview with a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Intrusive Work Environment Monitoring** Positions that involve productivity tracking software, keyword tracking, keystroke monitoring, or cameras taking pictures every 30 seconds indicate a highly controlled and distrustful work environment. Such environments often include "productivity coaches" who review "wasted time" and "wasteful activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

These red flags can be indicators of [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | poor employer recruitment practices]].

## Examples of Exploitative Job Postings

### Temporary Non-Paid Positions

A "Live Show Programming Assistant" role in New York City, a high cost-of-living area, was advertised as a "temporary non-paid position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This kind of [[issues_with_unpaid_work_expectations | unpaid work expectation]] is often illegal, as most states require compensation for work unless it meets specific, strict Department of Labor guidelines for internships related to coursework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This specific posting demanded accountability for program launches and required administrative skills, fluency in Excel, and email/call follow-upsâ€”all for no pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This is seen as a "predatory opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:45]</a>.

### Underpaid Software Development Role

A software development role required a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or equivalent, five years of development experience, and five total years of IT experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Despite computer science and programming being highly in-demand and high-paying fields, this position offered a wage of only $11 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This amounts to approximately $22,880 annually, which is less than a quarter of the typical entry-level salary for a software developer (around $75,000-$80,000 minimum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This is a severe [[mismatch_between_job_expectations_and_compensation | mismatch between job expectations and compensation]] and highlights significant [[salary_and_benefits_issues | salary and benefits issues]].

### Obnoxious Application Requirements

An "Agile Coach" position required an incredibly complex application process before even a preliminary call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Steps included:
*   Sending a resume in MS Word format via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   Sending a LinkedIn connection request to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   Reading a LinkedIn article about the company's "agile mentoring program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
*   Watching a specific video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   Ensuring Zoom video functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.
*   Matching availability with the recruiting director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   Sending a text message to the recruiting director's phone number to confirm Zoom readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.
*   Reviewing and following additional interview tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

This process is considered "unbelievable" and contradictory for an "agile" role, demonstrating a "clown show" in [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | hiring practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

### Unpaid Projects in Interview Rounds

A rotational management program for a major retailer required candidates to complete a project for the second interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Candidates reported spending an average of six to eight hours on these projects, followed by only 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for Q&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. This represents an entire workday's worth of unpaid work with no guarantee of advancing, especially if multiple candidates are asked to do it for a single opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. Self-respecting employers typically do not demand this level of unpaid work from candidates, especially for non-senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. This reflects significant [[issues_with_unpaid_work_expectations | issues with unpaid work expectations]] during the hiring process.

### Startup Promising Instability and Low Pay

A startup job description explicitly stated it was "not for people who need a stable and well-paying job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. The company admitted to being in the "same situation" regarding financial stability and expecting salaries to be "slightly below market rates" even after future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. They also warned of "shifting priorities" due to being an early-stage startup, implying inexperienced management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. The posting further expected a doctoral or master's degree in specialized fields with lab-based experience, yet wanted someone who doesn't "needs mentorship" or to be "told what to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>, essentially asking for a "unicorn" willing to be underpaid and have no stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. The "reward" for working "80-90 hour weeks" for $30,000-$40,000 less than market value was a promise of an "amazing dinner" after their first fundraising round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. This clearly outlines [[mismatch_between_job_expectations_and_compensation | mismatch between job expectations and compensation]] and [[salary_and_benefits_issues | salary and benefits issues]].

### Demanding Application for Part-Time Legal Admin

A part-time contract Legal Administrative Assistant position paying $15-$18 per hour (middle-of-the-road wages) had an overly demanding application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. Applicants were required to prepare a cover letter with specific formatting and content, including:
*   No more than two paragraphs and a closing sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.
*   Explaining the three most important qualities for the role and why they are important in the first paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>.
*   Explaining why they applied to "this crappy part-time contract job" in the second paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.
*   Closing the letter with the exact phrase: "I have read the instructions contained in the job posting and have followed the instructions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>.

This level of detailed and insulting instruction for a mid-range paying part-time role demonstrates [[hidden_job_requirements and biases in hiring | hidden job requirements and biases in hiring]] and [[the_pitfalls_of_contract_offers_over_full_time_positions | the pitfalls of contract offers over full time positions]].

## Conclusion

These examples represent "garbage opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> and are instances of [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | fake job postings and hiring practices]] or deeply flawed recruitment strategies. Accepting such offers enables these practices to continue. Job seekers are encouraged to have self-respect and avoid these types of listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

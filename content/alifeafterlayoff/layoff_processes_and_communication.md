Human Resources (HR) departments, while sometimes allies at lower organizational levels, often operate to limit company liability first and foremost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This priority heavily influences how they handle and communicate about [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]].

## Deceptive Communication and Preparations

### Confidential Job Postings
Companies frequently post confidential job listings (where the company name is blanked out) when they are actively seeking to replace an incumbent employee who is unaware of their impending termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This allows the company to pre-emptively find a replacement, ensuring someone is ready to step into the role once the current employee is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> If you encounter a confidential job posting, consider whether you want to work for a company that replaces employees behind their back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. If they do it to someone else, they can do it to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

### Denying Layoffs
HR departments often directly deny that [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] are being considered, even when they are actively planning them behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. If HR formally states that [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] are not under consideration, it is highly likely they are being planned at that exact moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### Using Performance Data for Layoffs
Prior to [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]], HR may ask employees to self-rank their [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] and skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. While presented as a way to understand the workforce, this information, along with [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] output and ratings gathered from managers, is often used to determine who will be included on a [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoff]] list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> If your company asks you to rank yourself, it's advisable to update your resume as this data might be used against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

## Poor Execution of Layoffs

The handling of [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | corporate layoffs and their effects on employees]] by HR departments has been described as extremely poor in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Despite public criticism, many HR departments continue to manage terminations poorly, often lacking dignity and humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

Common methods of poor layoff execution include:
*   Notifying employees via Zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   Disabling employee equipment access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
*   Not explicitly notifying employees, who only discover their termination when they can no longer access the building or their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

This lack of professional handling contributes to negative [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | workplace culture]] and further complicates the already difficult [[emotional_and_psychological_effects_of_layoffs | emotional and psychological effects of layoffs]] for employees. HR leaders are encouraged to improve these processes and advocate for more humane treatment of employees during these transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

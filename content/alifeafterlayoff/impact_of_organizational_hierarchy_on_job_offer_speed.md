The process of receiving a job offer can often feel painstakingly slow, with weeks sometimes passing before an offer materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. A significant reason for this delay is the multi-layered [[internal_approval_process_for_job_offers|internal approval process]] inherent in organizational hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This process involves multiple stakeholders and departments, each contributing to the overall timeline.

## The Debrief and Initial Consensus

After interviews are completed, the recruiter convenes a debrief meeting with all interviewing stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. During this meeting, each stakeholder provides a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" regarding moving forward with an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. If a near-unanimous consensus is reached, the offer process begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Compiling Offer Details

The Human Resources (HR) or Talent Acquisition (TA) department then gathers offer details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Reviewing the candidate's stated [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers|compensation expectation]] from their preliminary interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   Consulting local market wage surveys and industry wage data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   Analyzing internal salary bands (e.g., 25th, 50th, 75th percentile) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, with a preference to keep salaries at or below the 50th percentile for internal equity and future raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   Considering internal comparatorsâ€”salaries of others in similar roles within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

If a candidate's [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers|salary expectation]] is significantly higher than the average for the role, the HR department and hiring manager must make strategic decisions on the offer amount or explore creative ways to make a compelling offer without disrupting the existing salary structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The recruiter's role is to advocate for the candidate to ensure the offer is likely to be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## The Multi-Layered Approval Chain

Once an offer is drafted, it typically undergoes three or four layers of approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This chain usually includes:
1.  The hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
2.  The hiring manager's direct supervisor (hiring manager plus one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
3.  An HR business partner, distinct from the talent acquisition group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
4.  In some cases, the recruiting or talent acquisition team may have final approval before the offer is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

Even a smooth [[internal_approval_process_for_job_offers|approval process]] and negotiation can take at least a week, or potentially longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Factors Causing Delays within Hierarchy

Several issues related to organizational structure and decision-making can prolong the offer process:

### Unavailability of Approvers
The offer timeline is at the mercy of the approvers' availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. If key approvers are on vacation, in business meetings, or otherwise unable to review and sign off, the process stalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Managerial Disagreements
Sometimes, a senior manager is not fully aligned with the hiring manager's vision for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. A senior manager might intervene at the last minute to re-scope the role or scrutinize it more closely, halting an offer that was already in the approval pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. While this doesn't necessarily mean the offer will be rescinded, it causes significant delays due to re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

### Requirement for a "Full Slate of Candidates"
Even if a strong candidate has been identified and is ready for an offer, someone higher in the hierarchy might demand to see a "full slate of candidates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This requires additional recruiting time, potentially weeks, and can significantly slow down the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Recruiters often push back on such demands due to concerns about losing candidate engagement, as a candidate's interest typically wanes after two to three weeks without an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

### Process Bloat
Large companies can have extensive administrative or procedural steps built into their offer process for checks and balances or auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. This "process bloat" can involve slow and cumbersome software systems or an excessive number of steps, further slowing down the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

### Human Delays
Beyond formalized hierarchy, individual slowness can also be a factor. This includes:
*   Recruitment teams being slow to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
*   Hiring managers forgetting or delaying offer approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
*   HR teams being slow to provide information back to recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   Overloaded recruiters and hiring managers who have other priorities, causing the offer to get buried on their to-do list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

The slow movement of these "moving parts" negatively impacts [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers|candidate experience]] and is a source of frustration for recruiters who aim to fill positions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

For candidates waiting on an offer, it is advisable to politely check in with the hiring team, especially the recruiter, every two or three days to inquire about the offer status and timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. This can help create a sense of urgency for the recruiter to expedite the approval process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

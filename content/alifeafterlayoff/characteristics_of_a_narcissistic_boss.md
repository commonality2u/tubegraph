The narcissistic boss is one of the common [[types_of_bad_bosses_in_the_workplace | bad boss types]] encountered in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This type of boss is generally easy to identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Identifying Traits

Narcissistic bosses exhibit several distinct characteristics:
*   **Inflated Self-Worth & Ego** They typically possess a very inflated sense of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> and often act as if they own the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. They generally have a larger-than-life ego and desire to be the center of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Charming Public Persona** To the outside world, such as other departments, they often appear very charming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, their true nature becomes apparent behind closed doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Defensive of Accomplishments** They are highly defensive of their position and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, even if it comes at the expense of their subordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. If an employee achieves something that is recognized by others, the narcissistic boss may perceive it as a threat to their own accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Tearing Others Down** To elevate themselves, they might tear down employees in front of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Praise from a narcissistic boss is uncommon, as they want all attention focused on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

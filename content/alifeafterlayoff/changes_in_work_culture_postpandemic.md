The period following the 2020 pandemic has brought about significant [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | shifts in workplace dynamics]], particularly influenced by the phenomenon known as "quiet quitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This concept, a purported extension of the Great Resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, reflects a broader re-evaluation of work and employment relations by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?

Quiet quitting is defined as "effectively quitting your job without quitting your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. It involves reducing one's output to the minimum acceptable standard required for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This means doing "just enough to get by" without taking on extra tasks or burdens, thereby relieving personal stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. It is not an advocacy for laziness, but rather a strategic decision by employees to dial back their commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## The Rise of "Coasting Culture"

The concept of "coasting culture" emerged as many professionals, particularly during the pandemic, began to view work purely as a means to a paycheck, rather than a "higher calling that demands their utmost devotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This shift was facilitated by several conditions created or exacerbated by the pandemic:
*   **Hot Labor Market** A strong job market ensured job security, reducing the fear of unemployment for those who might reduce their effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Remote Work** The increase in [[shift_from_remote_work_to_hybrid_models | remote work]] made it more challenging for managers to monitor the effort employees put into their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling Exploited** Many employees felt "exploited by their employers" after years of working late nights, lost weekends, and demanding loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Instead of being seen as lazy, these employees are making a "considered, deliberate decision" to stop allowing companies to "squeeze free labor out of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This movement can be seen as a "secret resistance against the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, replacing the previous "hustle culture" with a new "coasting culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### From "Hustle Culture" to "Coasting Culture"

For a long time, the employment market favored employers, leading to a "hustle culture" where employees felt compelled to work long hours, take on extra tasks, and be available even outside of traditional work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This included taking calls on weekends and during family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

Companies historically followed a cycle of growth, becoming "bloated," and then undergoing [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | reductions in force or layoffs]] during catastrophic events like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. The pandemic in 2020 provided an "opportune time" for companies to make "ruthless cuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. However, many cut "too big, too deep," which "fractured the workforce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

This led to a "seismic shift in the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, as employees who had participated in the hustle culture and experienced layoffs felt a "deep sense of betrayal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. The market then swung in favor of the employee, as companies struggled to backfill positions after their "overzealous" cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The remaining employees were "piled on" with work, leading to burnout and a desire to exit the traditional workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

## [[Changing Expectations in the Modern Workplace]]

Employees are now re-evaluating their relationship with work, no longer willing to dedicate grueling hours or be constantly accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. They are establishing "employment boundaries in their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, recognizing that employers have "Behaved Badly" for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

Key takeaways about [[changing_expectations_in_the_modern_workplace | new employee expectations]] include:
*   Work is primarily a source of income to support oneself and family, not a "higher calling" demanding "utmost devotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
*   The notion of "my company's not my family" has prompted many to shed previous expectations and refuse to tolerate grueling hours they once accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.
*   The focus has shifted from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   After decades of "leaning in," many are now "deciding to lean back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

### Generational and Loyalty Shifts

This shift is partly attributed to a generational component, with Baby Boomers exiting the workforce and [[changing_expectations_in_the_modern_workplace | Gen Z entering]] with a "completely different mentality about the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

[[changes_in_workplace_loyalty | Company loyalty]] has become "antiquated"; staying with one company for 20+ years can even be "looked down upon" in certain circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Such longevity can also lead to falling "behind the employment curve" and being undercompensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

### Re-evaluation and Future Outlook

While not advocating for quiet quitting, it is suggested that individuals re-evaluate their work situation if they are unhappy with their treatment, compensation, or hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Keeping resumes updated and strategically planning an exit is presented as a better alternative to quietly quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. However, for those with accrued equity (like vacation time or 401k investments) who do not wish to quit, dialing back to the minimum acceptable output may be an option, as employers might prefer some output over none due to difficulties in backfilling positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

The overall sentiment is that employers are now forced to "re-evaluate how they treat their employees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

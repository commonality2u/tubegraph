Experiencing a layoff can be a significant [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | ego hit]], leading to self-doubt and questions about why one was selected [00:00:00]. Companies employ various criteria when determining which employees are placed on the [[reasons_companies_lay_off_employees | layoff list]] [00:00:10]. Often, a layoff is not the employee's fault [00:00:56].

The process typically involves an unexpected meeting where an HR person informs the employee their position has been affected by a reduction in force and presents severance terms [00:00:31].

## Seniority as a Layoff Factor

One significant factor companies consider during [[reasons_companies_lay_off_employees | layoffs]] is seniority [00:02:30].

Companies frequently lay off employees with less tenure, often adopting a "last in, first out" approach [00:02:34]. This means that individuals who have recently joined the company are frequently targeted as the first to be let go [00:02:44].

### Risks for Newer Hires

This practice presents a considerable risk for those considering leaving an established position for a new job [00:02:50]. Moving to a new company can make you the "low person on the totem pole" in terms of tenure [00:03:00]. To mitigate this risk, new hires should strive to outperform their colleagues in the new department, as seniority alone may not protect them from layoffs if their [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] is lower than others [00:03:06].

### Connection to Cost-Cutting

Seniority can also indirectly link to [[reasons_companies_lay_off_employees | layoffs]] through cost-cutting measures, particularly affecting [[impact_of_layoffs_on_latecareer_professionals | late-career professionals]]. Companies may scrutinize payroll department by department, looking for individuals who earn the most money [00:06:33]. If an employee's skills have atrophied or haven't kept pace with the market, but they maintain a high salary, their name may be circled on the [[reasons_companies_lay_off_employees | layoff list]] [00:06:44]. This is because companies can replace them with cheaper talent, as overall payroll is one of the largest expenses [00:06:58].

This becomes especially relevant during economic uncertainty or with the rise of disruptive technologies like AI, which can potentially eliminate more positions [00:07:07].

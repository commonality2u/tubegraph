Upon receiving a job offer, companies often conduct a background check and potentially a drug screen as a contingency for employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Understanding what employers typically look for can help demystify this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Background Check Process

Most employers outsource the [[overview_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] process to third-party companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These companies conduct the checks on behalf of the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The job application itself is a legal document, and applicants often certify that all information provided is correct and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Once hired, the application becomes a permanent part of the employment record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The application typically includes a section that grants the employer the right to check the applicant's background upon extending a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

After signing an offer letter, candidates usually complete another form authorizing the company to conduct [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_implications | criminal background checks]], [[verification_process_for_employment_and_education_history | employment verification]], and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This information, along with the release, is then sent to the third-party company for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Key Elements Checked in a Background Check

Employers use various resources, including databases and direct verification, to check an applicant's background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Employment Verification

*   **Process**: This process often starts with databases like "Work Number," where millions of employers submit employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. If database information is insufficient, the third party may directly contact previous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Information Verified**: The primary details checked are whether you worked for the company, the dates of employment, and the titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Income**: Employers generally do not check previous income, as it is becoming an [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Duration**: Most checks go back approximately seven to ten years of work history, though some may go back further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

#### Job Titles and Dates of Employment

*   **Massaging Titles**: It may not be a significant issue if you slightly adjust job titles on your resume to be more commonly accepted in the industry, as long as the level of the role remains the same (e.g., "Talent Acquisition Specialist" vs. "Recruiter" if they are equivalent levels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Red Flags**: A major discrepancy, such as changing your title to reflect a completely different level (e.g., claiming to be a director when you were an individual contributor), is a significant [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] and can cause major problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Fudging Dates**: Falsifying employment dates (e.g., adding extra months or years of experience you don't have) is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Criminal Background Check

*   **Felonies vs. Misdemeanors**:
    *   **Felony convictions** are more serious and can be a significant barrier to employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   **Misdemeanor convictions** are less serious and generally won't prevent you from getting a job, though each case is reviewed by the Human Resources department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Pending Cases**: Checks also include pending court cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Duration**: Generally, criminal background checks go back about seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, felonies prior to this period may still be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Verification**: The background check company contacts local courthouses in all locations you've lived to verify criminal records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Delays can occur if courthouses have antiquated, non-electronic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Warrants**: Criminal background checks can also reveal active warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Juvenile Infractions**: Typically, these checks do not report on juvenile infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Education Verification

*   **Information Verified**: This check confirms that you attended the schools and earned the degrees or certifications you claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This includes high school, college, and professional certifications (e.g., CPA licenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Process**: The verification company contacts the universities or institutions directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This process is usually quick as educational institutions are accustomed to these requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Consequences of Discrepancies and the Importance of Honesty

*   **Reporting Discrepancies**: The employer receives a detailed report highlighting any verified or unverified information, noting any exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Employer Action**: The employer may follow up with the candidate to clarify discrepancies or may withdraw the job offer immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Being proactive in responding to requests for clarification is in your best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Impact of Lying**: Since the job application is a legal document, lying on it can lead to termination for cause, even after you've been hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Falsifying information, such as having a friend act as an employment verifier, carries a high risk of the offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Disclosure**: If you have a criminal background, it is always better to disclose it upfront during the offer stage to ensure transparency and avoid surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

It is always advisable to be honest and forthcoming about your background and qualifications to ensure a smooth transition into your new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

When interviewing for a job or working for a company, certain phrases can act as "red flags" indicating that an employer might be making misleading promises or operating with questionable practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While not every company that uses these phrases is necessarily a bad place to work, they can often signify deeper issues regarding work environment, compensation, or job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Common Misleading Statements and Their Implications

### "We work hard, we play hard"
This phrase typically suggests an expectation of extremely long and stressful hours, often accompanied by difficult-to-achieve metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The "play hard" aspect often involves company events that occur outside of work hours (evenings or weekends) and are not compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The "hard work" is frequently incentivized with elaborate vacations or bonuses that are challenging to obtain, creating a "what have you done for me lately" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Such environments can quickly lead to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### "We are family"
Often heard in smaller, privately-owned companies, and sometimes even larger ones, this statement can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While it might sound appealing, employees are typically at work to earn a living, not to replicate familial relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Owners expecting employees to treat the company like their own family is unrealistic and can be insulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This type of environment can sometimes feel "cult-like" and be off-putting if an employee doesn't share the same level of enthusiasm or commitment as the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This phrase is often part of [[gaslighting_and_predatory_practices_by_employers | gaslighting and predatory practices by employers]].

### "We will promote you later, we promise"
If a company promises a promotion within a specific timeframe (e.g., six months or a year) during an interview, it's a significant [[signs_of_a_lowquality_employer | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This can be a tactic to underpay new hires or avoid paying them what they are truly worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. If such a promise is not in writing, it becomes difficult to enforce, especially if the hiring manager leaves the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For current employees, if a promised promotion's "target always seems to move," it's a strong indicator to seek employment elsewhere, as good companies value employees and don't play games with promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This is a common [[bait_and_switch_salary_tactics | bait and switch salary tactic]].

### "We wear a lot of hats here" / "We're in startup mode"
In a job interview, "we wear a lot of hats here" often means an employee will be expected to perform multiple jobs outside their primary scope, while only being paid the lower salary for the primary role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Similarly, if an established company (e.g., 5-7 years old) claims to still be in "startup mode," it's a significant [[signs_of_a_lowquality_employer | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This can be an excuse to continue overworking employees and avoid proper compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. High-quality companies typically have the resources to staff roles appropriately, so employees shouldn't have to wear multiple hats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This relates to [[employer_expectations_vs_reality | employer expectations vs reality]].

### "We only hire rock stars"
This phrase, often seen in job postings, aims to attract top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. However, it becomes a [[signs_of_a_lowquality_employer | red flag]] if the company isn't willing to compensate for the "best of the best" they claim to seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This often points to [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | challenges with unrealistic employer demands in job postings]].

### "We are always hiring"
If a company consistently has open positions, especially for the same roles, it's typically a [[signs_of_a_lowquality_employer | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While rapid growth can be an exception, for an established company, "always hiring" usually indicates a high employee turnover rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Potential candidates should ask probing questions about turnover rates during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This is a strong indicator of [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | fake job postings and hiring practices]].

### "We will call you back for a recall"
Companies that lay off employees at the first sign of trouble, often after claiming to be a "family environment," may promise to recall them when conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. However, this is often a misleading promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Returning to such a company means going back to an environment that has already demonstrated a lack of commitment to its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### "We've got a foosball table"
This common phrase is often used by companies aiming to appear "trendy" or "hip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. However, the presence of superficial perks like a foosball table does not negate a toxic work environment, poor treatment, or low pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. It can be a way to put "lipstick on a pig" and distract from the fact that it is a [[signs_of_a_lowquality_employer | low-quality employer]] that should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

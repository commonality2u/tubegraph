When considering a new job offer, two key indicators of a good employer are a clearly defined job description and a competitive wage offer right from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

## [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles | Evaluating Job Descriptions]]

A sign of a great quality employer is that the [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles | job description]] is clearly defined and realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:18">[02:36:18]</a>.

Key characteristics of a good [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles | job description]]:
*   **Appropriate Length and Detail** It should not be overly short, vague, or, conversely, excessively long with "everything but the kitchen sink" included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:18">[02:40:18]</a>. It should be "just right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:18">[02:47:18]</a>.
*   **Clear Expectations** You should gain a very good understanding of what is expected of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:18">[02:49:18]</a>.
*   **Realistic Expectations** The expectations should be realistic and achievable for one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:18">[02:54:18]</a>. You want to avoid situations where expectations are hopelessly out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:18">[02:57:18]</a>.

## Competitive Wages

A great quality job offer includes a very competitive wage right out of the gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>.

Consider the following signs regarding compensation:
*   **Exceeding Expectations** If your stated salary expectation was below the company's range, and they proactively offered you a higher wage, it indicates they truly care about their employees and won't let you lowball yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:18">[03:07:18]</a>.
*   **Pay Leader** A company that is a pay leader in its industry and invests in its people is often a desirable employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:18">[03:22:18]</a>.
*   **No Need for Negotiation** Receiving a great offer upfront, without the need for extensive back-and-forth [[evaluating_job_offers_and_negotiating_terms | negotiating]], is a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:18">[03:35:18]</a>.

### Sharing in Profitability
Great quality employers understand that employees with a stake in the business are more motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:18">[06:11:18]</a>. Look for offers that include:
*   **Performance Bonuses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:18">[06:08:18]</a>
*   **Equity Stake** A generous equity stake in the job offer can be a strong indicator of a desirable opportunity, assuming the company has strong products and services and is likely to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:18">[06:09:18]</a>. Sharing results with all employees ensures everyone is working towards the same goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:18">[06:18:18]</a>.

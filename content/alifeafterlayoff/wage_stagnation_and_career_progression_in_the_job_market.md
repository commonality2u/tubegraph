It is advisable to actively seek new job opportunities at least once every two years, even if you are content in your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This proactive approach helps prevent [[career_stagnation_and_regret | complacency]] and ensures the market does not outpace your career progression or compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. To act as the "CEO of your career" or a "free agent," it is crucial to monitor market trends constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Staying in a single job for an extended period can lead to the market passing you by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This concept is further explored in the video, [[why_a_steady_job_can_be_bad_for_your_career | Why a steady job is bad for your career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Cost of Staying Too Long

An anecdote illustrates the potential for [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | wage stagnation]] and the benefits of testing the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A top-performing individual in the medical field, happy in their role for 7-8 years, observed nearly 100% departmental turnover in 18 months due to high demand in their sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Upon receiving an external job offer of $5/hour more, their current employer issued a counter-offer of a $15/hour raise to retain them, citing high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This situation highlights how employers often wait until an employee is tendering their resignation to offer competitive compensation, raising questions about whether employees are significantly underpaid initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Employer Pay Philosophies and Retention

Companies generally fall into two categories regarding compensation:
*   **Pay Leaders**:: These companies proactively offer competitive wages to attract and retain top talent, often enabling them to poach employees from other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggers**:: These companies adopt a compensation philosophy that tolerates higher turnover, accepting it as part of their business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

However, a high turnover rate can be more expensive in the long run due to recruiting, training, and the loss of institutional knowledge and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The "Boomerang" Effect

There's been an increase in "boomeranging," where individuals who left during the "great resignation" return to former employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This often occurs when new jobs, despite offering higher salaries, prove to be unfulfilling or are within dysfunctional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. While accepting a counter-offer is generally not recommended, a substantial raise, like $15/hour, can be tempting due to established equity, vested benefits (like vacation time and 401ks), and familiarity with the work processes and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Onboarding at a new company can be a "pain in the butt" and many people dislike the feeling of being the "new person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Strategizing for Career Progression

It is essential to regularly test the open market as a strategic practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Even if satisfied, every two years, individuals should consider applying for jobs or networking with recruiters to:
*   Stay informed about market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Understand the skills and assessment methods currently in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Determine if they are being underpaid compared to market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Constantly leveraging minor external offers to negotiate raises with a current employer can be risky, as the company might eventually call the bluff and encourage you to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### The Impact of [[wage_growth_trends_for_job_switchers_versus_stayers | Job Switching vs. Staying]]

The market tends to pass by those who stay in a role for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Companies often offer 10%, 15%, or even 20% raises to new external hires to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This means that external wage increases can be significantly larger than those offered to internal employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Internal promotional bumps might be 5-10% every few years, while the market moves up more rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. It's common for new hires with less experience to earn the same or more than long-term employees whose salaries have only increased through small incremental cost-of-living adjustments (1-3% raises) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

With inflation, if a raise doesn't outpace it (e.g., 7% last year), employees are effectively earning less for the same work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This leads to [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | wage stagnation]], with individuals potentially being underpaid by a significant amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Recruiters often observe internal pay discrepancies where departments are 20-30% below market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. If you've been in the same job or role for more than two to three years without significant promotions or raises, the market has likely passed you by, making it imperative to test external opportunities to stay competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Falling too far behind can make it impossible to catch up unless the company implements a major salary adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Navigating the Job Market

Given the current volatility and rapid changes in the job market, staying informed and proactive about your career is more critical than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
[[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | Challenges in the current job market]] include the "whiplash" effect of frequent changes, impacting [[signs_of_economic_cooldown_affecting_job_opportunities | job opportunities]] and requiring continuous market monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Employers generally view [[understanding_the_risks_of_jobhopping | job hopping]] negatively, primarily because it indicates that an employee may not stay with the company for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This perspective is held despite the "double standard" where employers are often quick to lay off employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Defining Job Hopping

From an employer's standpoint, [[understanding_the_risks_of_jobhopping | job hopping]] is defined as moving from job to job in a relatively short amount of time, often at the same professional level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, if an individual jumps from job A to job B to job C without any clear career progression, employers consider this to be job hopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The specific timeframe considered "short" is subjective and varies between companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Employer Bias and [[challenges_with_job_hopping_and_resume_instability | Resume Instability]]

Employers tend to be biased against job hoppers, often requiring individuals to defend their employment history on their [[challenges_with_job_hopping_and_resume_instability | resume]] by explaining why they left previous positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This scrutiny typically increases as individuals move beyond entry-level roles, where job hopping for salary increases becomes less effective due to diminishing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Impact of Economic Changes on Employer Behavior

### The Hot Job Market (2021-2022)

During the peak of the job market, particularly from 2021 to 2022, employers faced significant challenges in retaining staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This period, especially in the tech market with roles like software developers, saw companies like Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Google engage in bidding wars, driving wages up drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. As a result, job switchers often received significantly higher wage increases than those who stayed in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. At its peak in October-November 2022, job switchers saw an average increase of 7.7%, more than 2% higher than stayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Companies struggled to compete with the open market, making it difficult to retain staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This environment contributed to phenomena like the "Great Resignation," as employees felt confident they could secure new jobs with higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Market Shift (2023-2024)

By May 2023, the wage market began to "break," with companies on the outside market realizing they were driving wages up too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This led to a drastic decrease in the wages employers were willing to pay for job switchers and even for retaining existing staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The shift resulted in increased layoffs and restructuring as companies aimed to "reset" the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

As of early 2024 (projected into 2025), the wage gap between job switchers and stayers has significantly narrowed. The incentive for leaving jobs for substantial pay increases is no longer as prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. When companies have a large pool of applicants, they can be more selective and offer lower pay, adhering to the law of supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Current Employer Mantra

The prevailing sentiment among companies over recent quarters is to retain desired staff, become more efficient (potentially through AI utilization), and engage in "right-sizing" through downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Beyond Job Hopping

While strategic job hops may still offer some potential for salary or level advancement, especially if entering a market as a "lagger," it is significantly less lucrative than a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Employers now prefer individuals with a long-term career strategy, built on demanded skills, effective marketing through resumes, interviews, and networking, and a clear personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

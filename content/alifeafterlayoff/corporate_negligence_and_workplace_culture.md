The death of a Wells Fargo employee at her desk, unnoticed for four days, brought significant attention to the issue of corporate negligence and the impact of [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | workplace culture]] on employee well-being.

## Incident Overview

Sixty-year-old Denise Prudhomme entered the Wells Fargo corporate office building in Tempe, Arizona, at 7:00 a.m. on Friday, August 16th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Four days later, on August 20th, building security called officials regarding a "subject down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. An anonymous employee reported finding Prudhomme dead in her cubicle while walking around the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It is believed she had been deceased for several days, likely due to a health event, with no foul play suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Failures in Awareness and Oversight

Several factors highlight a perceived lack of corporate oversight and employee care:
*   **Secluded Location** Denise Prudhomme's cubicle was on the third floor, "tucked away" and "away from the main aisle," which may have contributed to her going unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Ignored Warning Signs** Multiple people reportedly complained of a foul odor, but it was assumed to be due to plumbing issues rather than a more serious problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Lack of Check-ins** For four full days, from Friday to Monday, no one at the corporate office realized Prudhomme was not present or had not left the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. There were no apparent check-ins from bosses, no notice of her absence from meetings, or missing reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Employee Invisibility** The situation underscored a feeling of invisibility among employees, where individuals might not be noticed or engaged with by colleagues for social interactions like grabbing coffee or lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Hypocrisy of Return-to-Office Mandates** The incident highlighted the irony of financial institutions like Wells Fargo pushing for employees to return to the office to "experience the corporate office culture" and foster "collaboration," yet in this case, no collaboration or even basic awareness of a colleague's presence or absence was evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Company and Employee Reactions

A Wells Fargo spokesman expressed deep sadness over the "tragic loss" and extended thoughts and prayers to the family, stating that counselors were available and the company was cooperating with the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

However, fellow employees expressed heartbreak and concern, with one asking, "what if I was just sitting there would nobody would check on me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The idea that a colleague could be sitting dead at a desk and "nobody did anything" was described as making one feel "sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This points to potential [[effects_of_a_toxic_work_culture_on_health_and_career | toxic workplace dynamics]] and a severe lack of [[employee_wellbeing_and_company_accountability | employee well-being]] and accountability.

## Implications for Workplace Culture

The incident raised questions about the [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | corporate culture]] at Wells Fargo and more broadly, within the financial industry. Critics suggested that if Prudhomme's work were truly valuable, her absence would have been noticed sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The situation highlights a perceived failure in [[corporate_practices_and_employee_loyalty | employee loyalty]] and basic human regard, where an individual could be "completely forgotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

It has been argued that accountability is needed from management for failing to notice an employee was in the building and had expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the [[consequences_of_workplace_complacency | consequences of workplace complacency]] and the potential for a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic workplace environment and employee treatment]] where individuals might feel like "just a cog in a wheel, a number on a spreadsheet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

The tragedy led to recommendations for employees to prioritize their own well-being and seek workplaces where they are valued and noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This includes taking sick days and vacations without guilt, as "you never know when your last day is going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The advice is to "act like the CEO of your career because clearly nobody else is looking out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

After successfully interviewing and receiving a job offer, companies typically conduct a background check before finalising employment. This process is designed to verify the information provided by the candidate and ensure accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Offer Contingency and Authorization

A job offer is almost always contingent upon the successful completion of a background check, and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The job application itself is a legal document, and applicants often certify that all information provided is correct and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This application becomes a permanent part of the employment record once hired, usually granting the employer the right to check the applicant's background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Upon signing an offer letter, candidates typically receive another form that authorises the company to conduct [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_importance | criminal background checks]], [[employment_verification_in_background_checks | employment verification]], and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Employers generally outsource the background check process to a third-party company that verifies the information on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## What Employers Look For

Employers use various resources to check a candidate's background, including searching databases and verifying submitted records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### [[employment_verification_in_background_checks | Employment Verification]]

The most common starting point for [[employment_verification_in_background_checks | employment verification]] is "Work Number," a database where millions of employers submit employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This database can verify employment records and sometimes income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. If database information is insufficient, the third-party company may directly contact previous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Key details verified during [[employment_verification_in_background_checks | employment verification]] include:
*   Confirmation of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Dates of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Employers generally do not check previous income, as this is becoming an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While some companies may check a candidate's entire work history, most typically go back seven to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

It is generally not recommended to lie on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While minor adjustments to job titles (e.g., "talent acquisition specialist" instead of "recruiter" if they are the same level) may not be a major issue, changing a title to a completely different level (e.g., claiming to be a director when an individual contributor) can pose significant problems and raise red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Similarly, falsifying employment dates to add work experience is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_importance | Criminal Background Check]]

The [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_importance | criminal background check]] typically focuses on two main areas: felonies and misdemeanors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Felony convictions** are more serious and can be a significant barrier to employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Misdemeanors** are less serious, but their impact depends on the specific conviction and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Background checks generally look back about seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, but older felony convictions may still be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Pending court cases are also checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This check also includes active warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_importance | Criminal background checks]] usually do not report on juvenile infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Verification involves contacting local courthouses in all locations where the candidate has lived for a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Delays in this part of the process are usually due to courthouses having antiquated record systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### [[education_verification_in_employment_background_checks | Education Verification]]

The [[education_verification_in_employment_background_checks | education verification]] process confirms that a candidate attended the schools or obtained the degrees and certifications claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This includes high school, college, and professional certifications (e.g., CPA licenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Verification typically involves contacting the university directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This process is usually quick because universities are accustomed to these requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## [[consequences_of_failing_an_employment_background_check | Consequences of Failing an Employment Background Check]]

If a background check report indicates discrepancies or unverifiable information, the employer will receive a detailed list of these exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The employer may then ask the candidate for clarification or verification, or they might [[consequences_of_failing_an_employment_background_check | immediately rescind the job offer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. It is in the candidate's best interest to respond proactively to such requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Importance of Honesty

The job application is a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Lying on a resume or job application can lead to termination for cause, even after employment has begun, if the employer later discovers discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Falsifying information, such as having a friend or relative act as an [[employment_verification_in_background_checks | employment verifier]], carries a high likelihood of the offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Being forthcoming and having the credentials claimed is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

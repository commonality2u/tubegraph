They operate on a contingency basis, meaning they are paid only upon successful placement of a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This payment typically ranges from 15% to 25% of the hired candidate's first-year income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Headhunters generally have less in-depth knowledge of the specific role compared to an internal corporate recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

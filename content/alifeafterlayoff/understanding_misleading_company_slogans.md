When interviewing for or working at a company, certain phrases can act as [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] that indicate a potentially challenging or undesirable work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. While not every company using these phrases is necessarily a "bad" place to work, they are significant indicators to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Common Misleading Slogans

### "We Work Hard, We Play Hard"
This phrase often signals an expectation of very long hours and a stressful environment with potentially unattainable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The culture might be driven by fear, reminiscent of the "Glengarry Glen Ross" speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Hard work may be incentivized with difficult-to-obtain bonuses or elaborate vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Furthermore, the "play hard" aspects, such as celebrations, typically occur after hours or on weekends and are not compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Most individuals do not wish to spend uncompensated additional time on work-related commitments, especially when they have family obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### "We Are Family"
This slogan is commonly heard in small, privately owned companies, though larger companies may also use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. It can be annoying and a reminder that work takes away from time with one's actual family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The expectation for employees to treat the company like their family is often unrealistic and can be insulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Such environments can sometimes feel cult-like, which can be off-putting if an employee does not share the same enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

### "We Will Promote You Later, We Promise"
If a company promises a promotion in six months or a year during an interview to secure your commitment, it's a significant [[recognizing_false_promises_in_employment | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This often indicates the company either lacks the budget or is unwilling to pay what you're worth, using the promise as a dangling carrot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Without this promise in writing, it becomes difficult to enforce, especially if your hiring manager leaves the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. For current employees, if a promised promotion continually moves its target, it's a strong sign to update your resume and seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Good companies value their employees and properly handle promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

### "You Are Replaceable"
When a company explicitly states that employees are replaceable, it demonstrates a complete lack of value for its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This type of communication can lead employees to live in fear and give away their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. An employee's response to such a statement should be to make themselves replaceable by seeking a company that values their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### "We Wear A Lot of Hats Here" / "We're In Startup Mode"
Often heard in start-up companies or those claiming to be in "startup mode" for five to seven years, this phrase implies you'll be expected to perform multiple jobs outside your primary scope for a lower salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. High-quality companies typically allocate sufficient resources to staff roles appropriately, so employees shouldn't need to wear multiple hats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. If a company continues to use "startup mode" as an excuse, it's a [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] that they intend to overwork and underpay you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

### "We Only Hire Rock Stars" / "We Only Work With The Best of The Best"
Companies often use these phrases in job postings to sound appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. However, if a company is unwilling to compensate appropriately for "the best," it's a [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Checking employer review sites like Glassdoor can reveal if their claims align with employee experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### "We Are Always Hiring"
An established company that is consistently hiring for the same positions likely has a high [[understanding_company_turnover_as_a_red_flag | turnover rate]], indicating a revolving door of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. While rapidly growing companies may genuinely struggle to keep up, for established businesses, this is a significant [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. It's crucial to ask hard questions during the interview process if you encounter this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### "We'll Call You Back (After Layoff)"
Some companies lay off employees at the first sign of trouble, ironically often the same ones that promote a "family environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. They may promise a recall when conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. However, employees should question if they truly want to return to an environment that has demonstrated a lack of commitment to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. Returning to such a company is akin to a bad relationship where commitment is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### "We've Got A Foosball Table"
While seemingly a positive perk, a foosball table is often associated with "trendy" or "hip" organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. In reality, it can be mere "lipstick on a pig" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. If a company treats employees poorly, fosters a toxic environment, and pays low wages, a recreational amenity does not compensate for being a low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

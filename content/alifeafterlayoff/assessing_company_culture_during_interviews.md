Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, especially when dealing with low-quality employers who ask suspicious questions revealing ulterior motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Fortunately, employers often provide "tells" or [[key_interview_cues_and_their_meanings_from_corporate_recruiters | red flags]] during interviews that can indicate if an opportunity is low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Paying close attention to these cues can help you discern the true [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | company culture]] and decide whether to withdraw your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags in Interview Questions

Certain questions posed by interviewers can signal underlying cultural issues or undesirable workplace conditions. When these "off-putting" or "off-center" questions arise, it's crucial to listen carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Question about Unplanned Absences

A question like, "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?" can seem innocent, particularly for hourly employees where employers might be assessing attendance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, this question can reveal the [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | company culture]] and the hiring manager's philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If an employer is overly focused on attendance issues, it likely means they've experienced past problems and will be overly particular about attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This indicates a potentially inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For most people who don't abuse attendance, the expectation is to be able to call off when sick without repercussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Candidate Response**: It's advisable to ask the interviewer about their expectations around unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If they indicate a strict crackdown, it could point to a toxic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Question about Minimum Acceptable Salary

When an interviewer asks, "What's your minimum acceptable salary?", they are essentially trying to determine the lowest possible salary to secure your commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This suggests a lack of flexibility and an employer that might be predisposed to "lowballing" candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Such a question indicates potential struggles with competitive salaries, raises, and promotions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Question about Commitment to Staying Two Years

A question like, "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?" is a red flag indicating a potential turnover issue within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. It prompts the question: "Why are people leaving so quickly that you need to assess this in a job interview?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This type of question often stems from an employer's bias or a deeper [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | cultural problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Question about Being Fired

While a "hot button" issue for many, an interviewer asking if you've ever been fired is generally considered inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Your past employment decisions are not necessarily their business; their focus should be on your ability to perform the job at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Past performance is not always the best indicator of future performance, as a termination might have resulted from a bad situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

*   **Candidate Response**: If asked, it's best to redirect the question to focus on the future and your accomplishments, stating that your past employment status shouldn't impact your ability to do the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If the interviewer continues to probe or cause grief, consider withdrawing your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Accusations of Resume Exaggeration

If an interviewer accuses you of exaggerating or embellishing your resume (assuming you haven't), it's a sign of a toxic employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Starting a new role with an employer who already distrusts you, or assumes everyone is lying, is a major red flag for the expected [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Question about Biggest Failure

A question like, "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?" is often considered a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. While the intent might be to understand how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. An employer focusing on your failures may use your answer as a bias against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

*   **Candidate Response**: If you must answer, focus briefly on the failure and then emphasize how you overcame the adversity, turning it into a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Questions Implying Poor [[work_life_balance_and_company_culture | Work-Life Balance]]

Questions about your availability for off-shifts or weekends, especially for roles advertised with specific shifts, are common red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This indicates that you'll likely be working unwanted overtime, suggesting a poor [[work_life_balance_and_company_culture | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

*   **Candidate Response**: Push back to get clear expectations on true work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Questions about On-Site Availability for Remote Roles

If a remote job interviewer asks about your availability to come on-site, it suggests the position isn't truly remote but rather a hybrid role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If a "fully remote" job is pitched as hybrid, there's a high likelihood it could eventually transition to 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This is a significant red flag for those seeking remote-first positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Questions about Dealing with Rude Colleagues

Being asked, "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?", immediately raises concerns about the existing work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. It suggests you might be working with difficult individuals, and if the rudeness extends to management, it's a critical red flag indicating a serious [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | cultural issue]] that should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## The Absence of Opportunity to Ask Questions

A significant red flag, not tied to a specific question, is when the interviewer dominates the conversation and does not provide you with an opportunity to ask questions of your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This indicates that the employer forgets an interview is a two-way street, where you should be [[assessing_leadership_and_company_culture_in_interviews | assessing the company]] as much as they are assessing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. If an interviewer takes offense to your professional questions, it suggests they believe they are "above you" and not to be assessed, which is a major red flag for their [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Conclusion: Using Red Flags for [[assessing_leadership_and_company_culture_in_interviews | Cultural Assessment]]

These red flags indicate potential deeper [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | cultural issues]] that warrant further probing before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Important Note**
> One or two of these questions alone don't necessarily mean the company is poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. However, they serve as additional data points. It is crucial to ask good probing questions to understand the situation fully and know what you're getting into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

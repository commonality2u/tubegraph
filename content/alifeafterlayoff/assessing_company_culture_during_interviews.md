When evaluating job opportunities, it is crucial to look for signs of a high-quality employer and a great company culture during the [[evaluating_company_culture_during_interviews | interviewing process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. A strong company treats its employees well and is a place where one can envision a long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Brian from Life After Layoff, a [[preparing_for_corporate_recruiter_interviews | corporate recruiter]], highlights several indicators of an outstanding company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Key Indicators of a Great Company Culture

### Internal Promotion Opportunities
A significant sign of a great company is its commitment to promoting from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It is recommended to ask the interviewer, "Why is the position open?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. If the response indicates that the previous employee was promoted to a more advanced role, it suggests a culture that encourages internal advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Companies that encourage internal movement often have a high percentage of employees advancing their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Low Turnover Rates
A strong company generally does not have high turnover issues, as employees typically do not want to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While external candidates might find it challenging to ascertain exact turnover rates, one can investigate press releases for recent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Companies that frequently lay off staff only to rehire later are usually not a sign of a great employer, as this "knee-jerk reaction" can keep employees on edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The industry standard for turnover is approximately 20%, but aspiring employees should aim for companies with under 20% turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Compensation and Benefits Philosophy
A great company typically operates as a "pay leader," strategically offering higher compensation to attract top talent and retain employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Job seekers can use platforms like Glassdoor or LinkedIn to find self-reported salary information and assess if a company is a pay leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Beyond salary, examine the company's benefit structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Look for:
*   Strong medical, dental, and vision programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Competitive 401(k) plans and bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Consistent investment in and expansion of employee benefits packages over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Company Ratings and Feedback
During [[importance_of_company_research_before_interviews | company research]], check for consistently high ratings on various websites such as Glassdoor, Indeed, or Comparably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Delve deeper by reading employee feedback on pay philosophy, benefit structure, and [[assessing_company_strategy_and_leadership_style | leadership team]] behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Investment in Personal Development
Companies that value personal development are typically associated with low turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Look for employers who:
*   Provide additional training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Offer opportunities to demonstrate new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Support attendance at industry conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Positive Employee Experience and Recognition
A great employer invests in the overall employment experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This includes:
*   Rewards and recognition programs that go beyond basic job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Celebrating personal milestones like birthdays, weddings, or births <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   Involving employees' families in company celebrations or events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Work-Life Balance
A great company hires an appropriate number of people to manage workloads effectively and values employees' time off for recharging and family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. If interviewers indicate expectations of long hours or reviews consistently mention work-life balance issues, it is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Look for companies with generous vacation policies that provide substantial paid time off early in employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Trustworthy Leadership
The [[assessing_company_strategy_and_leadership_style | leadership team]] of a great employer is honest, transparent, and embodies the company's core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Trustworthy leaders "say what they mean and mean what they say," backing their words with actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Targeting a company with a great reputation at the senior leadership level is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Positive Employee Morale
While difficult to assess during an interview where individuals may put their best foot forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, one can look for signs of good morale. This involves reviewing external feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, asking targeted questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, and observing the environment if visiting on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A positive sign is when people seem to enjoy their work and the company of their colleagues, indicating high morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

By diligently [[evaluating_job_offers_and_company_culture | assessing company culture]] using these indicators, job seekers can target the best possible employers for their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

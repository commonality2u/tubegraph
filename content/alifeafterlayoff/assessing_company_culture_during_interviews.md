Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, especially when encountering low-quality employers who ask suspicious questions revealing ulterior motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Employers often provide "tells" that, if paid close attention to, can help discern if an opportunity is low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Listening carefully for certain questions can indicate a low-quality employer, making it advisable to [[evaluating_the_company_and_role_as_a_candidate | bow out and avoid headaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flag Questions

Certain questions posed by interviewers can serve as [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags]] and indicate potential issues within the [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | company culture]] or management style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
While seemingly innocent, this question often indicates a deeper issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Indicator**: The employer is trying to determine if you will be an attendance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Cultural Insight**: A hyper-focus on attendance suggests the department or manager has dealt with past attendance issues and will be overly particular about attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Workplace Flexibility**: It likely means the workplace is not flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, and employees may face repercussions for calling off sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Candidate Action**: Ask the interviewer about their expectations for unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If they state they are "cracking down," it's probably an indicator of a [[signs_of_organizational_dysfunction_during_interviews | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
This question directly asks how cheaply they can acquire your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Indicator**: It suggests a lack of flexibility in compensation and an employer trying to lowball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Future Implications**: If they start by trying to lowball, expect struggles with maintaining a competitive salary, raises, and promotions, as they will likely always try to "nickel and dime you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
This question hints at potential underlying problems within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Indicator**: It suggests a turnover issue where the company struggles to retain people in the same role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Candidate Reflection**: This should prompt you to question why people are leaving so quickly that the employer feels the need to assess this commitment in a job interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Relevance**: This question has little bearing on a candidate's potential success in the job and may indicate a larger [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | cultural problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### "Have you ever been fired?"
This question probes past employment decisions that are often irrelevant to the current opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Relevance**: Your past employment status is generally not the interviewer's business; they should focus on the job at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Fairness**: Past performance, especially in a bad situation, is not always the best indicator of future performance, and you shouldn't be "tarnished" for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Candidate Action**: Redirect the question to focus on your accomplishments and future capabilities in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If they continue to probe or give grief, consider withdrawing your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Accusations of Exaggerating or Embellishing Your Resume
Assuming your resume is accurate, such accusations are a major [[signs_of_organizational_dysfunction_during_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Indicator**: Starting a new job with an employer who already doesn't trust you is a bad sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Cultural Insight**: This suggests a [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | toxic employer]] who assumes everyone is lying or calls people out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
This is considered a trap question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: There's little to gain from this question other than potentially using your answer against you or introducing bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Alternative**: While interviewers might aim to understand how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase such a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Candidate Action**: If you must answer, focus briefly on the failure and then emphasize how you overcame the adversity, making it a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Questions about Availability for Off-Shifts/Weekends or Coming On-Site for a Remote Job
These questions provide insight into work-life balance and true job expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Off-Shifts/Overtime**: For hourly or even salary positions, this indicates you'll likely work overtime, possibly against your will, and suggests a poor work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Remote Work**: If a "remote job" interviewer asks about your availability to come on-site, it's not truly remote but a hybrid position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If pitched as fully remote, there's a high likelihood it will eventually become 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Candidate Action**: Push back to get clear expectations for work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
This question immediately raises concerns about the workplace environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Indicator**: It suggests you might be working with difficult or rude colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Major Red Flag**: If the manager themselves is the source of rudeness, it's a significant [[signs_of_organizational_dysfunction_during_interviews | red flag]] to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This points to a definite [[company_culture_and_employee_morale | cultural issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Lack of Opportunity for Candidate Questions
The absence of a chance to ask your own [[essential_questions_to_ask_during_an_interview | questions]] is a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Interview Dynamics**: An interview is a two-way street; candidates should be [[evaluating_the_company_and_role_as_a_candidate | assessing the company]] and interviewer just as much as they are being assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Cultural Insight**: If interviewers dominate the conversation or take offense when you ask professional questions, they may believe they are "above you" and that you shouldn't be assessing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This is a clear indicator of a potentially undesirable [[corporate_culture_and_employee_value | company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

One or two of these [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] questions alone might not signify a poor-quality company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. However, they serve as crucial data points to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. It's vital to ask good probing questions to ensure you fully understand what you're getting into before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. [[Job interview experiences | Interviewing]] is also an opportunity for you to [[evaluating_the_company_and_role_as_a_candidate | evaluate the company]] and ensure it aligns with your career goals and values, demonstrating the [[importance_of_researching_the_company_before_an_interview | importance of researching the company before an interview]] and assessing the [[assessing_company_vision_and_growth_opportunities | company vision and growth opportunities]].

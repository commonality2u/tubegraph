Everybody is going to make a career mistake at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While advice can be given, individuals are likely to make these mistakes themselves, often learning them the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article outlines some of the most common career mistakes observed in coaching calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Many of these insights come from personal experiences or observations of others who have learned from their mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Not Realizing Critical Mistakes Until Years Later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

The biggest lesson often learned is that a critical mistake was made early in one's career, but it isn't recognized until much later, sometimes when it's too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

This can manifest in several ways:
*   **Overstaying a Role** Staying in a job for too long or "overstaying your welcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Missing Opportunities** Not responding to a recruiter for an amazing job opportunity due to fear or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Poor Job Fit** Accepting a job offer that wasn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Geographic Limitations** Moving to a part of the country that wasn't ideal, or conversely, not moving to a location that could have opened an entirely new career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Narrow Focus** Focusing too long on a specific job type or career vertical, only to realize later it wasn't resonating, making a change much more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

It's easy to look back with hindsight and wish one had made different choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Often, individuals seek career coaching when they feel stuck or unhappy with their progression, allowing a coach to pinpoint where their career diverged from the optimal path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This is particularly true when contemplating a career change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Loyalty Rarely Pays Off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

Many learn the hard way that loyalty to a company or leader often doesn't lead to anticipated career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. An example shared is staying in a role for years, waiting for a promised promotion that never materialized because the senior leader never retired as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Staying too long out of loyalty can be dangerous:
*   **Market Stagnation** The rest of the job market can move beyond your skill set and level, leaving you behind your peers in terms of leadership roles, responsibilities, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Lost Opportunities** Excessive loyalty can cause one's career to go off track, letting leadership opportunities pass by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Hard Work Does Not Automatically Lead to Promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

A common misconception is that putting in long hours and doing "hard work" guarantees promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This often results in a "dangling carrot" that is continually pushed further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Feeling pressured to work excessive hours, especially under a workaholic boss, can lead to burnout without career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Work Smarter, Not Harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>

Promotions are not earned by working the most hours, but by working the smartest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This involves:
*   **Visible Projects** Working on projects that are highly visible and important to your direct manager and their boss (your boss's boss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. If you're working on tasks your superiors don't care about, your contributions won't be recognized when promotion discussions happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Self-Advocacy** Actively letting people know about your accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. You must advocate for yourself, as no one else in the organization will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Targeting the Right People** Your boss's boss is often the key decision-maker for promotions, so finding ways to be visible to them is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing Yourself** As the "CEO of your career," you need to wear multiple hats, including marketing. This means putting together campaigns to showcase your effectiveness within your company, department, and job, and on the open market during [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | interviews]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This mindset is vital for those aiming to move up in an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Focusing on Irrelevant Skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>

While being exceptional at a specific skill can be an advantage, relevant skills matter more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Employers value certain skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

*   **Employer-Specific vs. Market-Wide Skills** You might possess a skill valued by one employer, but if you leave that organization, you might find that other companies or the broader industry don't value that skill in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Outdated Resume** This can lead to a resume full of skills that are no longer in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Career Stagnation** When skills become irrelevant, individuals may panic, settle for jobs beneath their capabilities, and get stuck in a cycle of "low-quality jobs," which can significantly damage their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The key is to focus on developing highly relevant skills that are in demand by *multiple* employers, not just your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## You're Only as Good as What You've Done Lately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>

A particularly painful lesson, especially relevant during periods of layoffs, is that past achievements and "goodwill" are often short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While past successes might buy a few months, employers primarily care about current and future contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

*   **Transient Goodwill** The goodwill built up from great work is typically very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Many are baffled to find themselves on a layoff list despite past contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Future-Oriented Management** Senior leaders are concerned with what you can produce tomorrow, not just what you produced yesterday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Therefore, it's essential to act like a "free agent" in your career, always looking out for your own interests first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Putting yourself first is not a "dirty word"; it's about being the CEO of your career and continuously developing the necessary skills to stay relevant and in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

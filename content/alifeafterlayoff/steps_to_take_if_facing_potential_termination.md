If you suspect your job may be on the line, it's crucial to consider a contingency plan and take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This video from Ryan at Life After Layoff, an expert with 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting for major corporations, offers guidance on how to respond if you're seeing [[signs_youre_about_to_get_fired | signs you might be getting fired]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that a separate video will delve deeper into specific actions to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. However, this video provides some initial recommendations:

## Responding to Performance Issues

### Addressing Low Metrics
If your performance metrics are significantly below those of your co-workers, and your productivity is notably behind the group, your name is likely on a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. In this situation, you should either:
*   **Focus on improving your performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Reevaluate if the job is the right fit for you** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### When Your Boss is Displeased
If your boss suddenly becomes displeased with your work, be proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Instead of waiting, consider sitting down with your boss to:
*   **Understand expectations better** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Ask for support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
    *   *Note:* A boss's displeasure can also lead to work redistribution or exclusion from key meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### If Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a serious red flag, typically a last resort for performance-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. It's a defined period with measurable goals that must be met to keep your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. If you find yourself on a PIP, you must:
*   **Take it very seriously** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Actively improve your performance** to meet the defined metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Successfully meeting the PIP's goals can allow you to return to the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, but failure to do so will result in termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

## Overall Approach

If you observe any of these [[signs_youre_about_to_get_fired | signs you're about to get fired]], you need to:
*   **Start thinking about "what's next" for you** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Take action** with concerted effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Decide if you want to salvage the situation or "cut bait"** and make a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

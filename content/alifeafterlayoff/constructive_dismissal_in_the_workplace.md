Constructive dismissal, also known as "quiet firing," is an HR concept where an employer makes an employee's work or employment situation so unbearable that the employee feels they have no option but to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This tactic is often employed by companies to avoid directly terminating an employee, which could lead to complications or the obligation to pay certain benefits like unemployment insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Companies might resort to this if they deem an employee a potential problem and fear that direct termination could cause additional issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

If you feel an uneasy feeling that your days at a company might be numbered, these are some signs that a company may be attempting to "quietly fire" you or engage in constructive dismissal:

### Financial and Career Stagnation
*   **Lack of Raises:** You haven't received a raise in several years, especially when other colleagues in your department or company have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This can be a strong indicator that the company has cut you off from future raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Repeatedly Passed Up for Promotion:** Despite making your interest known and positioning yourself as a strong candidate, you are consistently overlooked for promotions, even in favor of less deserving individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. When a company chooses to promote someone else, there's often a discussion about potential fallout or damage control if you feel you were in line for the promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Changes in Work Conditions and Management
*   **Denied PTO or Vacation Requests:** Your requests for paid time off or vacation are repeatedly denied, assuming you are not abusing the time, it makes sense, and you've coordinated coverage with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This suggests the employer doesn't value you and aims to make your work life uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Placement on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):** Being placed on a PIP or similar performance management tool often signifies that the company is trying to manage you out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. If the plan's requirements seem unreasonable or not based in reality, it's likely an attempt to subtly or overtly encourage voluntary resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Manipulated Schedule or Workload:**
    *   **Mandatory Overtime:** Your schedule is suddenly altered to include a lot of mandatory overtime, especially during times your boss knows you are unavailable or would be burdened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Hours:** Conversely, your hours might be cut to the bare minimum required to maintain employment, potentially affecting your benefits eligibility and paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   **Excessive Workload:** An unreasonable amount of work is dumped on you, making your situation unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Unscrupulous companies may use this as a motivator for you to seek a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Deterioration of Relationships and Inclusion
*   **Lackluster Performance Appraisals:** Your performance reviews suddenly become negative, especially if you've had good appraisals in the past, and your boss becomes overly critical about things they were previously complimentary about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. HR departments use these appraisals for formal documentation, particularly if you are considered a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Boss Disengaging:** Your boss stops communicating with you, missing or rescheduling one-on-one meetings, not responding to emails, or being consistently unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. They may fail to provide necessary information or help clear roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Exclusion from Work or Social Activities:** You are suddenly removed from projects you were leading, no longer invited to staff meetings you used to attend, or excluded from "water cooler talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. You might even feel shunned in public when your boss is with other colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

It's important to note that one or two of these signs alone don't automatically mean you're being quietly fired, but they should prompt you to pay attention and trust your gut feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## [[options_for_dealing_with_a_toxic_work_environment | Options When Facing Constructive Dismissal]]

If you find yourself in a situation where you believe the company is constructively discharging you or preparing for it, you have several options:

1.  **Force the Company's Hand:** You can continue with the status quo and let the company proceed with termination if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This route can sometimes be beneficial as it may open up options for unemployment benefits or severance packages that are typically not available with a voluntary resignation.
2.  **Act Like a Free Agent:** [[proper_way_to_quit_a_job | Quit your job]] and seek a new position at a more supportive company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Staying in a [[toxic_work_environment | toxic work environment]] is detrimental to your personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. It's always a good practice to keep your resume updated and network, so you're not scrambling when you need to make a move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
3.  **Consult an Attorney:** If you believe you are being discriminated against, it is advisable to find a local attorney who can interpret local laws and advise you on your rights and potential legal recourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

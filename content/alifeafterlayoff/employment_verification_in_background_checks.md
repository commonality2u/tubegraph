Upon receiving a job offer, companies typically indicate that the offer is contingent upon the successful completion of a background check, which often includes employment verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This process aims to verify the information provided by the candidate on their [[employment_background_check_process | job application]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Verification Process

Employers generally outsource the [[employment_background_check_process | background check process]] to a third-party company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This third party conducts the check on behalf of the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The job application itself is considered a legal document, and often includes a certification stating that all information provided is correct and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This application becomes a permanent part of an individual's employment record if they are hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

After signing the offer letter, candidates usually complete another form authorizing the company to conduct various checks, including [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_importance | criminal background checks]], employment verification, and potentially drug screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. If the job application is incomplete, the employer may prompt the candidate to finish it before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Once all information and releases are obtained, they are sent to the third-party company for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## How Employment is Verified

Employers use various resources to check a candidate's background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This includes:
*   Searching databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Verifying submitted employment records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Contacting current or most recent employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

A common starting point for employment verification is "The Work Number," a database where millions of employers submit employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This database can verify employment records and, in some cases, income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. If the database information is insufficient, the third party may directly contact the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The main aspects checked during employment verification are:
*   Confirmation of employment at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Dates of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Job titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Generally, previous income is not checked by employers, as asking about it is becoming an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While some companies may check a candidate's entire work history, most typically go back about seven to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Job Titles and Dates of Employment
It is advisable not to lie on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, minor adjustments to job titles that are still at the same professional level (e.g., "talent acquisition specialist" instead of "recruiter") are generally not an issue during a background check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Significant changes, such as claiming a director title when one was an individual contributor, could be a major red flag and cause problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Similarly, [[risks_of_falsifying_information_on_job_applications | falsifying employment dates]] to add extra months or years of experience is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Discrepancies
If there is a discrepancy between the information provided on the job application and what is verified, the candidate could [[consequences_of_failing_an_employment_background_check | lose the job offer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The employer receives a detailed report from the background check company, noting any exceptions or unverified information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The employer may circle back to the candidate for clarification or explanation, or they could withdraw the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. It is in the candidate's best interest to proactively respond to any requests for additional information to help verify their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The job application is a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If an employer discovers that a candidate has falsified credentials, even after they have been hired, they can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. It is crucial to be honest and forthcoming with one's background and ensure that all claimed credentials are accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Attempting to use a friend or family member as an [[advice_for_handling_previous_employment_issues_on_a_resume | employment verifier]] can lead to an offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

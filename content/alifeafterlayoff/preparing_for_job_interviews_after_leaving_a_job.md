When seeking a new role, the way you exited your previous employment can significantly influence your [[preparing_for_job_interviews | job interview]] process. Employers often ask why you left your last job, and understanding the pros and cons of quitting, being fired, or being laid off is crucial for effective [[discussing_reasons_for_leaving_current_job | discussion]] during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Quitting Your Job
Quitting means you leave on your own terms, proactively bettering your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This often allows for bigger pay increases when testing the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Advantages of Quitting
*   **Control and Preparation:** You choose the timing of your exit, often with another job already secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This provides a significant advantage over those who are laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Rehire Eligibility:** If you quit properly, you might be eligible for rehire, offering a valuable safety net if your new employer or the economy takes a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Reduced Interview Stress:** It's easier to get a new job when you already have one, as there's less pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This allows you to relax and sell yourself more easily in interviews, often resulting in more negotiating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Narrative Control:** Quitting provides the initiative to spin your reason for leaving positively during an interview, as you likely have a strong rationale for your move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Quitting
*   **Burned Bridges:** Improperly quitting or burning bridges may make you ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty:** The "grass isn't always greener" â€“ your new job might not be better, or your previous role may already be filled if you wish to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **No Severance or Unemployment:** You typically won't receive a severance package or collect unemployment benefits if you voluntarily leave your job, unless it was due to a toxic work environment and was your only option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Getting Fired
Being fired means the employer ends your employment arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Advantages of Being Fired
*   **Unemployment Eligibility (Conditional):** You may be able to collect unemployment benefits, especially if terminated for poor performance rather than gross negligence (e.g., causing a fight, theft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Employers have a harder time defending an unemployment claim if the firing was purely performance-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Being Fired
*   **Stigma:** There is a significant stigma associated with being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Difficult Interview Conversations:** You will need to explain away poor performance or other difficult circumstances in interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Being terminated for cause is the hardest to overcome in an interview setting, as it raises immediate red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control:** The termination is not on your terms, and you may receive no warning, being thrust into the unemployment market unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **No Rehire or Positive References:** You are generally not eligible for rehire and it's difficult to get positive references from a former employer after being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While employers generally don't disclose termination during employment verification, they may check references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Being Laid Off
Being laid off occurs when an employer eliminates your job role altogether, often due to business restructuring rather than individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Advantages of Being Laid Off
*   **Unemployment Eligibility:** You are almost always eligible for unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Severance Package:** Many layoff situations include a severance package, which may consist of a lump sum of money, continuation of benefits, and access to outplacement services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Rehire Eligibility:** You might be eligible for rehire depending on your past work performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Interview Justification:** In a mass layoff event, it's generally not overly concerning to explain that you were caught in a "mass reduction in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Being Laid Off
*   **Lack of Control:** Layoffs are rarely on your terms, and many people are caught completely off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This can be devastating, especially for good performers who are unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Stiff Competition:** If it's a mass layoff event, you may face abnormally stiff competition from many other people seeking similar jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This makes having a standout resume even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Stigma/Bias:** There can be some stigma associated with a layoff in an interview setting, as employers may unfairly perceive a laid-off person as "damaged goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. It's up to the candidate to know how to present themselves effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Specific Scenarios for Job Seekers
*   **Poor Performance:** If you have a track record of poor performance and are on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), it might be better to get fired for performance-related issues than to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Getting fired for performance allows you to collect unemployment and potentially have a continuation of benefits, with no real advantage to quitting in this specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Anticipated Layoff:** If you know your industry or market is softening but your company hasn't announced layoffs, you might want to wait before quitting. Quitting just before a layoff could mean missing out on a hefty severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

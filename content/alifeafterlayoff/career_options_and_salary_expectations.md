### Professional Video Game Bug Tester and Finder

This is highlighted as an "insane amount of money to play video games all day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

### Minor League Baseball Player
Minor league baseball players generally have low pay, at $2,000 per month for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

### Corporate Development
A "corporate development" professional claims $350,000, though the exact nature of the role is unclear, leading to humorous speculation within the thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Such a salary suggests a director or high-level senior director role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

### Options Investor
An options investor reports $125,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. While the "sky's the limit" for traders, there's significant risk involved, and money can be lost just as quickly as it's made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.

### Package Handler (USPS)

### 9-1-1 Operator
A 9-1-1 operator makes $28 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. This is considered a reasonable wage for a high-stress job that is "not for everybody" due to the urgency and types of encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.

### Animator (Video Games)
An animator with 16 years of experience in video games earns $28 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. This is noted as significantly less lucrative than video game bug testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

### Social Worker
A social worker makes $46,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. The advice is to pursue social work or non-profit careers out of passion or calling, rather than for the money, as these industries typically do not pay as much as tech or software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. Side hustles are suggested to supplement income in such roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

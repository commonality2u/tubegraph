Identifying predatory job postings is crucial for job seekers to avoid exploitation and wasted effort. These types of opportunities often appear "scary" due to their poor quality and exploitative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Employers who offer such terms are often considered to be engaging in [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory hiring practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Job seekers must recognize these [[recognizing_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] and [[avoiding_predatory_job_offers | avoid predatory job offers]] to prevent enabling these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Common Red Flags in Job Postings

When reviewing job opportunities, several [[scam_job_postings_warning_signs | warning signs]] indicate a potentially predatory or [[fake_job_postings | fake job posting]]:

*   **Excessively High Salaries** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>: If a salary is significantly higher than the market rate for a similar position, it might be a tactic to "dangle an extreme incentive" and attract candidates to an otherwise undesirable or exploitative work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Excessive Pre-Interview Requirements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>: Demanding hours of assessments or extensive preliminary tasks with no guarantee of an actual interview or contact with a person is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Intrusive Productivity Tracking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>: Some remote positions use tracking software for keystrokes, mouse clicks, and even cameras taking pictures every 30 seconds. This level of surveillance, coupled with "productivity coaches" monitoring "wasted time," indicates an extremely controlled and potentially abusive work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This can also include strict monitoring of breaks, like using the restroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Specific Examples of Predatory Job Postings

### Unpaid Positions

Job postings that explicitly state they are "temporary non-paid positions" are a major red flag, especially in high-cost-of-living areas like New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Illegality**: Many such postings may be illegal, as the Department of Labor has regulations regarding compensation, even for internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **High Responsibility for No Pay**: These roles often demand accountability and a wide range of skills (e.g., administrative work, Excel, communication) for no compensation, making them a predatory attempt to exploit labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Absurd Requirements for Low Pay

Some postings illustrate [[identifying_absurd_job_postings_and_requirements | absurd job postings and requirements]] coupled with extremely low wages.
*   **High Education/Experience, Low Wage**: An example includes a software development role requiring a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, five years of development experience, and five years of total IT experience, all for a mere $11 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This hourly wage amounts to approximately $22,880 annually, which is significantly less than the $75,000-$80,000 minimum an entry-level software developer should expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This is even below the wage typically paid at a fast-food restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Overly Complex Application Processes

Companies sometimes create "obnoxious" and "tone deaf" application processes that screen out good candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Unnecessary Steps**: An "Agile Coach" position required candidates to:
    *   Send resumes in MS Word format via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    *   Send a LinkedIn connection request to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Read a LinkedIn article about their "market differentiator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   Watch a specific video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   Ensure Zoom functionality and text the recruiting director to confirm it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   Match availability with the recruiting director using a scheduling software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
    *   Review extensive interview tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
    Such processes are not "agile" and demonstrate a disregard for the candidate's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Demanding Lengthy Projects

Requiring candidates to complete projects that consume a significant amount of their personal time without compensation or guarantee of an offer is a common predatory tactic.
*   **Uncompensated Labor**: A rotational management program for a major retailer asked candidates to spend an average of 6-8 hours creating a project, with only 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for Q&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This represents an entire work day of uncompensated labor, especially problematic if multiple candidates are asked to do it for only one hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Self-respecting employers typically avoid this, or if an assessment is needed, it should be done during the interview itself with limited prep time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Startups with Financial Instability

Job postings from unstable startups often present unique [[fake_job_postings_and_why_they_exist | reasons fake job postings exist]].
*   **No Stable Pay**: An opportunity explicitly stated it was "not for people who need a stable and well-paying job," admitting the company itself was not financially stable and might pay "slightly below market rates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Misleading Incentives**: They promise a "massive impact project" and the chance to "build a legendary company" but offer only future promises (e.g., an "amazing dinner" after fundraising) instead of fair compensation or stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Expectations**: Such roles often demand highly educated "unicorns" (e.g., doctoral degrees in specialized sciences) willing to be underpaid, work long hours (80-90 hour weeks), and receive no mentorship, all while facing shifting priorities due to inexperienced management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Overly Detailed Application Instructions for Low-Paying Roles

Even for part-time, middle-of-the-road paying positions, some employers impose insulting application requirements.
*   **Book Report-Style Cover Letters**: An administrative assistant role paying $15-18 an hour required a cover letter with specific paragraph structures, including explaining "the three most important qualities" for the role and why they applied, ending with a specific sentence to prove they followed instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. This is seen as insulting and implies the applicant is "too stupid" to follow basic instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

Job seekers should prioritize self-respect and avoid applying to these types of [[identifying_lowquality_job_postings | low-quality]] and predatory opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Accepting such offers only enables employers to continue these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

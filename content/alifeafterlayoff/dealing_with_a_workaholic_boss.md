Understanding different types of difficult managers is essential for career management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. One common type of manager you might encounter is the workaholic boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Identifying a Workaholic Boss

A workaholic boss is typically easy to recognize due to their extreme dedication to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. They are often the first person to arrive in the morning, turning on the lights, and the last person to leave at night, locking the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. A clear indicator of a workaholic boss is if they send emails on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## The Problem with a Workaholic Boss

While dedication to work is not inherently bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, the issue arises when a workaholic boss expects their employees to match their intense level of dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This expectation is particularly prevalent when dealing with a company owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. As commentator GaryVee highlights, employees will generally never be as dedicated to the company's mission as the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Navigating the Situation

If you find yourself working for a workaholic boss and this kind of demanding environment does not align with your preferences for [[worklife_balance_and_excessive_working_hours | worklife balance]], it may be necessary to consider seeking a different job opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if you are dealing with a challenging boss, it doesn't mean you should immediately quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Instead, it's crucial to have a game plan for managing your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. A steady job is not an excuse to tolerate a [[handling_problematic_work_situations | bad work situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

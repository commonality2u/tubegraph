Brian, a corporate recruiter, reacted to a video by "Logical Finance" that documented an experiment of applying to 1,000 jobs to assess [[the_reality_of_a_labor_market_shortage | the reality of a labor market shortage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. From a recruiter's perspective, Brian noted several [[challenges_faced_by_rec_ in_hiring_processes | challenges faced by recruiters in hiring processes]] in the current [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>.

## Current Market Landscape for Recruiters
The labor market is currently "very difficult" from a recruiting perspective for many positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. Industries like retail, heavy industry, and trucking are struggling to find people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Finding candidates for skilled labor, professional roles (especially in software), and highly technical jobs is particularly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. In contrast, positions in sales, business development, and finance are generally easier to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Issues with Resumes and Applications
Recruiters face specific challenges due to how job seekers present their applications:

### Non-Compliant Resume Templates
Resume templates purchased from platforms like Etsy or Canva are often designed by graphic designers for aesthetics rather than functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. These "pretty" but dysfunctional templates make candidates "essentially invisible" to applicant tracking systems (ATS) due to their layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

When a resume is not ATS-compliant, the system struggles to properly scrape and populate candidate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This results in job seekers having to manually re-enter their information after uploading their resume, a common problem that indicates the resume is not being read correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This also means recruiters cannot easily discover these candidates through boolean searches in their ATS system later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Lack of Resume Customization
Applying without customizing a resume significantly reduces the impact of an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Customizing a resume for each job is the single most impactful thing a job seeker can do to increase their chances of getting a callback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Recruiters prefer multiple versions of resumes, especially if a candidate has experience in different career verticals, to clearly niche down their skills rather than appearing as a "jack of all trades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

### Unnecessary Application Steps
Some companies add frivolous steps to applications, such as asking for a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. While intended to be light-hearted, these questions can cause anxiety for job seekers and add an unnecessary layer to an already lengthy process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

### Assessment Tests at Application Level
Recruiters themselves express frustration with companies that require assessment tests (e.g., personality profiles, Wonderlic tests) at the initial application level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. This practice is considered "completely un-candidate friendly" and offers a "terrible candidate experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. Many job seekers, including recruiters themselves, will abandon an application if an assessment is required upfront, viewing it as a sign that the company does not value their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

## Inaccurate Job Postings
The meme of "entry-level job requiring three to five years experience" is often exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. When an employer labels a job as "entry-level" but lists high experience requirements, it's typically an issue with the ATS system using machine learning for classification, not human error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. Recruiters' ATS systems automatically propagate job postings to various boards, and they don't always have manual control over how they're categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. Similarly, requests for experience in a programming language that hasn't existed that long often stem from a recruiter not knowing the technology or an overzealous hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.

## Recruiter Workload and Burnout
A significant [[current_job_market_challenges | current job market challenge]] for recruiters is being "super overloaded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. This is partly due to the fact that it is a "buyer's market for recruiters," with more recruiting jobs open than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. When a corporate recruiter is handling 30, 40, or even 50 requisitions (open positions) each, it becomes extremely difficult to maintain the application process effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>.

A typical corporate recruiter engaged in "sourcing" (actively finding candidates due to a tight labor market) should ideally handle only 7 to 15 requisitions, with 20 at an "absolute max" before diminishing returns set in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. This high volume of requisitions is a primary reason why recruiters may sit on applications longer than preferred, leading to job seekers not hearing back promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. Many recruiters are experiencing burnout and high turnover because of these demanding conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.

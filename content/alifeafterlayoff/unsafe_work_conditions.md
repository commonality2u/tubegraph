Being asked to perform tasks that are unsafe is a definitive "deal breaker" situation that necessitates leaving a job quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. While most companies are expected to adhere to safety protocols, such as those governed by OSHA rules, some may disregard these guidelines to complete work faster or maximize profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Why Safety is Non-Negotiable
Safety is paramount and should never be compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. When a company asks an employee to do something unsafe, less than safe, or to skirt OSHA guidelines, it demonstrates a lack of commitment to that employee's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. No job is worth risking one's life or limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Taking Action
If you are in a situation where you are asked to do something that "doesn't feel right" regarding safety, it is crucial to trust your intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Steps to Take
1.  **Voice Concerns to Your Boss**: Speak to your immediate supervisor and express your concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. A competent leader should intervene and address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
2.  **Escalate to HR**: If your boss is unresponsive, report the issue to your HR leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Any decent leader would immediately stop work and address concerns before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### When to Leave
If, after voicing your concerns, the company continues to prioritize its bottom line over your life or well-being, it is absolutely advisable to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. A steady job is not a valid reason to tolerate poor working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The "Great Resignation" is a phenomenon gripping the world's workforce, where people are voluntarily leaving their jobs in mass due to global events over the last 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Research by Microsoft indicates that up to 41% of currently working individuals plan to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The U.S. Labor Department reported a record four million people voluntarily quit their jobs in April 2021, marking the beginning of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift

The pandemic significantly impacted people's perspectives on work and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>:
*   **Reassessment of Time**: Individuals began to see their lives differently, realizing how much time was spent commuting and in office settings that were not always necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For example, some faced commutes of four and a half to five hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Remote Work Stigma**: Historically, remote work carried a stigma of being less dedicated or not part of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Ironically, many working remotely found themselves working more hours than when they commuted to an office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Forced Adaptation**: Companies, previously reluctant to adopt remote models, were forced to figure out how to get most of their workforce to work remotely during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This revealed that many positions, particularly white-collar professional roles, could indeed be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **School Closures**: Unexpected school shutdowns and the need for homeschooling required major sacrifices for many families, highlighting companies' flexibility or rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Overcorrection by Companies**: Some companies overcorrected by cutting deeper into their workforce, anticipating a greater business impact from the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This led to remaining employees being overloaded with extra work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Digital Burnout**: The shift to blended or work-from-home models led to constant digital interactions (e.g., Teams and Zoom calls), causing widespread digital burnout and exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Impact on the Labor Market

The current labor market is characterized as a "buyer's market" in many positions, with a high number of open roles and fewer people to fill them due to voluntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Companies with rigid philosophies on returning to the office, remote work, and [[work_life_balance_and_company_culture | flexibility]] are struggling to be competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. [[influence_of_remote_work_dynamics | Remote work]] and the [[importance_of_worklife_balance | importance of worklife balance]] are no longer just competitive advantages; they are becoming standard expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. A recruiter notes that concerns about remote work and [[importance_of_worklife_balance | work-life balance]] are now much bigger concerns for candidates than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## The Employee Experience and Future of Work

Many individuals are experiencing [[career_dissatisfaction_and_changes | career dissatisfaction and changes]], with a vast majority of those seeking career coaching already gainfully employed but looking for different career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This reflects a desire to avoid being stuck in antiquated thought processes and business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Companies must adapt, especially in recruitment, by offering [[work_life_balance_and_company_culture | flexibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. While salary, compensation, and benefits remain important, job seekers also prioritize:
*   Clear career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
*   Reasonable [[importance_of_worklife_balance | work-life balance]] (e.g., not expecting 60-70 hour workweeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
*   Full-time employment over contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
*   Flexible work arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>

The "employment experience" is defined as how an organization shapes the way people work and live, encompassing productivity, flexibility, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Companies must offer these benefits to stay current and competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This shift is forcing companies to redefine their priorities, which can ultimately be a positive outcome for the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

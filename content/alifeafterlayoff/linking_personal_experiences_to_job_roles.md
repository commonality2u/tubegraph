The question "Why should we hire you?" is often cited as one of the most feared questions encountered in job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, having hired thousands of people for well-known companies, explains what hiring managers are truly seeking with this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A poll conducted on LinkedIn confirmed this, with a majority of job seekers identifying it as their most anxiety-inducing interview question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Understanding the Interviewer's Perspective

To effectively answer "Why should we hire you?", job seekers must first understand the underlying reason for the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Interviewers are trying to gauge if a candidate comprehends the purpose of the position and the specific problem the company aims to solve by filling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

From a hiring manager's viewpoint, a new position is typically created to address a "business gap" or "business problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This could be due to an employee leaving, a new project needing specific skills, or a new division being launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Recruiters work closely with hiring managers through "intake calls" to define the job specifications, critical needs, and required skills, ultimately creating an "ideal candidate profile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Understanding this business problem is crucial for a strong answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## A Three-Part Formula for Success

The recommended strategy for answering "Why should we hire you?" involves a three-part formula:

### 1. Understand the Business Problem
The first step is to identify why the [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles|position]] is open and what business problem it is intended to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This means understanding the specific project, skill set, or bandwidth issue the department faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

To uncover this:
*   **Study the [[evaluating_job_descriptions_and_roles|job description]]**: Pay close attention to key points and required skills, as these are strong indicators of what the business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Listen to the recruiter**: During the initial screen, listen carefully to what the recruiter says about the role and the company's needs. They will provide valuable insights to use in later interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### 2. Link Your Past Experiences
Once the business problem is clear, the next step is to connect your past experiences and successes directly to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If the role involves a particular project, highlight how you've successfully completed similar projects or solved comparable problems in previous [[challenges_and_insights_into_various_job_roles|roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This demonstrates a proven track record relevant to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 3. Demonstrate Future Solutions
The final part of the answer involves explicitly showing how you would apply your experience to solve *their* specific business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This could involve outlining the steps you would take or discussing your approach to a particular project mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The goal is to make the interviewer visualize you successfully performing the required tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Avoiding Generic Responses

A common mistake job seekers make is giving generic answers such as:
*   "I'm a team player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> (which is physically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>)
*   "I'm a fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   "I achieve results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'll hit the ground running" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

While these statements sound positive, they are "generic and fluffy" and do not provide specific information about the candidate's capabilities to solve the company's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Instead, focus on tying past business results you've achieved to the specific business problem the company is facing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

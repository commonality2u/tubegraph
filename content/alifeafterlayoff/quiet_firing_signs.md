[[Quiet quitting and quiet firing | Quiet firing]] is a situation where a company attempts to make an employee's work or employment situation so unbearable that they feel they have no option but to quit voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This concept is formally known in HR as constructive dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

Companies might consider constructive dismissal to avoid potential problems if they were to terminate an employee directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Another common reason is to avoid paying out certain benefits, such as unemployment insurance, which they would be liable for if the employee was terminated, but not if they quit voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

If you're experiencing an uneasy feeling that your days at a company might be numbered, it's wise to update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Signs of Quiet Firing

While no single sign automatically means you are being [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet fired]], noticing several of these indicators should prompt you to pay attention and trust your gut feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### No Raise in Several Years
If you haven't received a raise in several years, especially when you know other colleagues in your department or company have, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This suggests the company has decided to cut you off from future raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### Repeatedly Passed Up for Promotion
If you've expressed interest in a promotion and have actively positioned yourself for it, yet are consistently overlooked for others, even those potentially less deserving, it's a sign to monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Companies often discuss the potential fallout when promoting someone else over an employee who feels they are next in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. If you're continually blocked from advancement, it's advisable to update your resume and explore other job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Denied PTO or Vacation Requests
Assuming your time off requests are reasonable, properly coordinated for coverage, and not abusive, repeated denials of your PTO or vacation requests can indicate that your employer does not value you and intends to make your work life uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

### Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
Being placed on a PIP or another performance management tool often signifies that the company is beginning the process of managing you out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. While not every PIP leads to termination, if the plan's requirements seem unreasonable or detached from reality, it's likely an attempt to encourage you to leave voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Schedule Manipulation
Companies might manipulate your work schedule to encourage you to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This can include:
*   **Mandatory Overtime**: Suddenly assigning excessive mandatory overtime, particularly during times the boss knows you are unavailable or it would cause significant burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Hours Cut**: Conversely, your hours might be drastically reduced to the bare minimum required to maintain employment, which can impact your paycheck and benefits eligibility, pushing you to seek new employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Unbearable Workload
An employer might dump an overwhelming amount of work on you, making your situation unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This tactic is used by unscrupulous companies to motivate an employee to seek another job, especially when there's no additional pay and the workload forces undesirable hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Suddenly Lackluster Performance Appraisals
If your performance appraisals, which were previously positive, suddenly become critical about aspects your boss used to praise, it's a major warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. HR departments use performance appraisals as formal documentation, and if you are being considered a performance issue, your boss would be actively engaged with HR to manage and monitor this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Constant criticism can be a demotivating factor designed to push you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

### Boss No Longer Communicating
A significant warning sign is when your boss disengages from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This can manifest as:
*   Missing or repeatedly rescheduling private one-on-one meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   Not making you a priority or appearing consistently busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   Failing to respond to emails promptly or provide necessary information to clear roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Removal from Typical Work or Social Involvement
If you are suddenly excluded from work you were typically involved with, it's a strong indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   A project you were leading being handed off to someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   Not being invited to staff meetings you previously attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   Being excluded from casual "water cooler talk" or shunned by your boss in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## Your Options
If you find yourself in a situation where you believe the company is constructively discharging you or preparing to, you have a few options:

*   **Force Their Hand**: You can maintain the status quo and allow the company to terminate you if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
*   **Seek New Employment**: Embrace the "free agent" approach by quitting and finding a more supportive workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. Staying in a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic environment]] is detrimental to your personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This is effectively choosing to take [[signs_to_quit_your_job | signs to quit your job]].
*   **Consult an Attorney**: If you believe you are being discriminated against, seek advice from a local attorney to understand relevant laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

It is always a best practice to keep your resume updated and ready, preventing a scramble when you need it most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

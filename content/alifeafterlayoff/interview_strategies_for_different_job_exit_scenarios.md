When an employer asks why you left your last job, the answer can significantly impact your [[strategies_for_successful_job_searching_and_interviewing|job search]] success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This article breaks down the pros and cons of quitting, getting fired, or being laid off, particularly as they relate to job interviews.

## Quitting Your Job

Quitting your job means leaving on your own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This proactive approach signifies you are managing your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, often leading to bigger pay increases by testing the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Advantages of Quitting
*   **On Your Own Terms**: You carefully choose when to exit, often with another job already secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Eligibility for Rehire**: If you leave correctly, you might be eligible for rehire, providing a safety net if things don't work out with a new employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Easier Job Search**: It's generally easier to find a new job while currently employed, as there's less pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This allows you to relax, sell yourself more effectively, and have greater negotiating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Control Over Narrative**: You have the initiative to frame your reason for leaving in an interview positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Quitting
*   **No Severance or Unemployment**: You will typically not receive a severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> or unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> (unless it was a toxic work environment and you had no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>).
*   **Burned Bridges**: If you leave on bad terms, you may not be eligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**: The new job might not be better than the old one, or your previous role might be filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Interview Strategy for Quitting
When asked why you left, employers want to know you had good reasons and didn't simply quit due to a tough situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Be prepared to show how you overcame adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Getting Fired

Being fired means the employer ended your employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This option typically has fewer positives compared to quitting or being laid off.

### Advantages of Being Fired
*   **Potential Unemployment Eligibility**: If fired for poor performance (not gross negligence or misconduct), you might be able to collect unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. An employer has a hard time defending against an unemployment claim for poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Continuation of Benefits**: In performance-related terminations, there might be some continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Being Fired
*   **Stigma**: There's a significant stigma associated with being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Difficult Interview Conversations**: You'll have to explain poor performance or other difficult reasons for termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Not on Your Terms**: Termination is often sudden, thrusting you into the job market unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **No Rehire/Negative References**: You are unlikely to be eligible for rehire or receive positive references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While employment verification usually only confirms dates, reference checks can reveal the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Interview Strategy for Being Fired
Admitting termination will raise red flags with employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. They will scrutinize your resume and assess you as a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. If it was purely performance-related (and not for cause), it may be strategically better to accept the termination for the sake of unemployment benefits, especially if your chances of positive references or rehire were already low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Being Laid Off

A layoff occurs when your job role is eliminated by the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While sometimes performance-related, it's often due to company restructuring or economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Advantages of Being Laid Off
*   **Unemployment Benefits**: You are almost always eligible for unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Severance Package**: Many layoffs include a severance package, which can provide a lump sum of money, continued benefits, and access to outplacement services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Eligibility for Rehire**: Depending on your work performance, you might be eligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Being Laid Off
*   **Not on Your Terms**: Layoffs are often sudden and unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, leaving good performers unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Stiff Competition**: Mass layoffs can flood the job market with many people seeking similar roles, increasing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Stigma**: Some employers may have a bias, perceiving laid-off individuals as "damaged goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Interview Strategy for Being Laid Off
If you were part of a mass layoff, simply state that you were "caught up in a mass reduction in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Be prepared to address potential bias from outdated employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Specific Scenarios

*   **Poor Performance**: If you are facing documentation or a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) due to poor performance, it might be better to be terminated (if purely performance-related) than to quit. This allows you to collect unemployment and potentially retain some benefits, as your references and rehire eligibility are likely already compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Softening Market**: If you anticipate an industry or market downturn and potential layoffs, it may be beneficial to wait for a layoff rather than quitting. Quitting preemptively could mean missing out on a significant severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Employer Preferences in Interviews
From an employer's standpoint:
*   Being fired for cause is the most difficult situation to overcome in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Being laid off in a mass event is generally understandable and less concerning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Quitting your job is often the most preferable, provided you can give strong, justifiable reasons for your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

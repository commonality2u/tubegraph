Many job postings feature requirements and processes that are considered predatory and low-quality, reflecting employers who take advantage of job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Accepting such offers enables these practices to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is crucial for job seekers to arm themselves with skills to avoid settling for "utter garbage" opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

[[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | Red flags in job postings]] often indicate such employers. For instance, an aggressively high salary—double the market rate—can be a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | warning sign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This suggests companies are dangling extreme incentives to compensate for undesirable work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Examples of Demanding Processes and Red Flags

### Excessive Assessments and Surveillance
One recruiter aggressively pursued an individual with a high salary, but the application process involved three to five hours of assessments without any guarantee of a preliminary phone interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The role was fully remote, featuring tracking software for productivity and keywords, along with camera snapshots every 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If productivity metrics (like keystrokes or mouse clicks) weren't met, or if the employee stepped away from the computer, a "productivity coach" would call to review "wasted time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Even using the restroom could trigger a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Despite the high salary, this environment was deemed unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Unpaid and Underpaid Positions
*   **Temporary Non-Paid Positions:** Some job postings explicitly state that positions are temporary and non-paid, asking applicants not to apply if they cannot work without pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This is often illegal, as most states require compensation, with Department of Labor regulations outlining strict tests for unpaid internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Such opportunities often come with significant responsibilities, seeking individuals to perform administrative tasks, Excel fluency, and follow-ups for no compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This is a predatory tactic to exploit job seekers for free labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **[[absurd_job_requirements_and_red_flags | Ridiculous Requirements for Low Pay]]:** A software development role, typically a high-demand and high-paying field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, was listed with a bachelor's degree in computer science, five years of development experience, and five years of total IT experience, all for a wage of $11 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This equates to approximately $22,880 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, which is less than a quarter of the market rate for such experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> and even lower than what one might earn at a fast-food restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Impractical and Demanding Application Steps
Companies often implement "robust screening processes" that are tone-deaf to the current job market, which is a "seller's market" where candidates have more leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

*   **Agile Coach Application Hoops:** An application for an Agile Coach position (a role focused on efficient processes) included an extensive list of pre-interview requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>:
    *   Sending a resume in MS Word format to a specific email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    *   Sending a LinkedIn connection request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Reading a LinkedIn article about the company's "agile mentoring program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   Watching a particular video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   Ensuring Zoom video functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   Matching availability with the recruiting director using a scheduling tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   Sending a text message to the recruiting director's personal phone number confirming Zoom functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
    *   Reviewing interview tips and following an "entire other process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
    This process is paradoxical for an "agile" role, demonstrating a "clown show" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

*   **Uncompensated Projects:** For a rotational management program at a major retailer, candidates in the second round were asked to complete a project that took an average of six to eight hours to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This project would then be presented in 15 minutes, followed by a 15-minute Q&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This demands an entire workday of unpaid labor with no guarantee of advancing, especially when multiple candidates are doing the same for a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Self-respecting employers typically avoid such demands unless for very senior positions requiring business idea pitches, and even then, in-interview assignments with short prep times are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Unstable Startup Opportunities
Some startups advertise positions by stating they are "not for people who need a stable and well-paying job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. They admit to financial instability, expecting employees to work for "slightly below market rates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> while waiting for future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. These roles lack stability, involve shifting priorities, and offer no mentorship, implying an inexperienced management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Despite demanding a doctoral or master's degree and lab-based experience, they promise only a "nice dinner" after raising their first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, expecting candidates to work 80-90 hour weeks for significantly less pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Insulting Application Instructions
A part-time legal administrative assistant role, paying a middle-of-the-road $15-$18 an hour, included extensive and insulting application instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>:
*   A cover letter of no more than two paragraphs with a specific closing sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   The first paragraph required explaining the three most important qualities for the role and why they are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   The second paragraph required explaining why the applicant applied to "this crappy part-time contract job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   A mandatory closing sentence: "I have read the instructions contained in the job posting and have followed the instructions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
This level of detail, especially for a part-time position, is designed to ensure compliance rather than assess genuine fit or interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

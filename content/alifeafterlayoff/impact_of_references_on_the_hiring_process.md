When seeking a job, candidates are often asked to provide professional references. Recruiters and human resources professionals utilize these references as part of the hiring process, though their [[importance_of_reference_checks_in_the_hiring_process | importance]] and the way they are handled can vary significantly between companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Do Companies Check References?

The answer is yes, some companies do require and check references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This practice is most common in smaller companies or agencies that might submit candidates to larger corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These entities are likely to follow through and contact the provided references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Questions Asked During Reference Checks

When a reference is contacted, recruiters typically ask a series of questions related to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>:
*   The job itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   The candidate's work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   Attendance (especially for hourly positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   Any concerns to be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Eligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

### [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | Challenges for Recruiters]]

One significant challenge for recruiters is the difficulty in tracking down references and getting them to return calls, which can delay the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## [[liability_concerns_with_providing_references | Liability Concerns with Providing References]]

Many larger companies and even some small to medium-sized ones are reluctant to provide detailed references due to [[liability_concerns_with_providing_references | liability concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If a previous boss gives a negative reference that prevents a candidate from getting a job, they could face legal action for slander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Human resources professionals aim to limit exposure to any possible liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For this reason, large corporations often instruct employees, especially direct managers, not to give out references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Instead, all reference inquiries are filtered back to the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

In such cases, the HR department typically only provides "name, rank, and serial number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This means they will only confirm:
*   The candidate's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   Dates of employment (start and end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   Job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

They generally will not disclose compensation, rehire eligibility, or reasons for termination, as this information could also open the company to liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## [[guidelines_for_selecting_and_providing_references | Guidelines for Candidates Providing References]]

If you are asked to provide references, take it seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Follow these [[guidelines_for_selecting_and_providing_references | key tips]]:

1.  **Select Legitimate and Relevant References:**
    *   Include at least one professional reference who was a direct manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   Ideally, all three references should be managers for the most valid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   If a manager isn't possible, choose someone you directly supported, like a customer (internal or external) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Avoid listing peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Someone a level or two above you who can speak to your performance is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

2.  **Ensure a Positive Recommendation:**
    *   Only provide references who you are confident will give you a good recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   A negative reference can complicate the hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

3.  **Obtain Permission and Inform Your References:**
    *   Always call or get permission from individuals before listing them as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Inform them that you are interviewing and that they might receive a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This prevents delays caused by them mistaking the call for spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Overall Weight in the Hiring Process

For most major employers, reference checks are generally a final administrative step, not heavily weighted in the overall hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. As long as your manager confirms you were good and they would work with you again, you're likely fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If you reach the reference check stage, it's a strong indicator that a job offer is likely forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Candidates can generally rest assured that past negative situations like terminations will not be disclosed by major corporations due to liability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

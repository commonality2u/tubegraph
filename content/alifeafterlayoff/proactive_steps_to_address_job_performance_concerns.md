With 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting, recognizing these indicators early allows for action, whether it's improving performance or considering a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## Identifying Potential Performance Issues

Several signs indicate that your job performance might be on the rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>:

*   **Declining Metrics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>: Your performance metrics are significantly lower than your co-workers, especially if your department publishes these figures (e.g., sales quotas, measurable targets). If your productivity consistently lags, your name will likely be on a list of underperformers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Boss's Displeasure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>: Your boss is suddenly unhappy with your work output. This suggests you're not meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Work Redistribution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>: Your responsibilities, such as client accounts or project involvement, are being taken away from you. This indicates a loss of faith in your ability to perform the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Exclusion from Key Discussions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>: You are no longer invited to meetings or discussions you once attended. This often means your boss is stepping in to do damage control or distance you from projects and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **"Weirdness" from Supporting Groups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>: Cross-functional leaders or groups you support start acting strangely, possibly withholding information. This can be a subtle sign of underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Drastically Slipping Performance Appraisals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>: If your previously good performance reviews suddenly become very critical, it's a significant warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Managers, often guided by HR, will document performance decline to build a paper trail for potential dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. HR professionals push for documented coaching sessions to defend adverse employment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Being Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>: A PIP is a formal, defined period with measurable goals that must be met to retain your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Not hitting these defined metrics typically results in termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. While serious, it can be overcome if performance improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Taking Action

Upon noticing any of these signs, it's essential to take immediate and concerted action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

*   **Improve Your Performance**: If your metrics are down, focus your efforts on increasing your output to match or exceed your peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Communication**: If your boss is displeased, initiate a meeting to clarify expectations and ask for support or guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluate Your Fit**: If improving performance seems unsustainable or the role no longer aligns, consider if it's the right fit for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Consider a Contingency Plan**: Begin thinking about what's next for your career, whether that means doubling down on current efforts or exploring new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Salvage or Cut Bait**: You must decide whether to try and salvage the current situation or "cut bait" and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

Taking prompt action and deciding your next steps is vital for navigating a potentially difficult employment situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

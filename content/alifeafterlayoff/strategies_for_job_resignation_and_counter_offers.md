When considering a job change, especially after receiving a new offer, it's crucial to understand how to approach your current employer and navigate potential [[understanding_counteroffers_from_employers | counter offers]]. While general advice suggests declining [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | counter offers]] from your current employer, each situation requires careful consideration of your individual circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

## When to Decline a Counter Offer

Most career coaches advise against accepting a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Experience shows that accepting a counter offer often doesn't work out well in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Common Employer Tactics After Resignation
When you tender your resignation, your current employer might suddenly unveil "big plans" they had for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> or promise future opportunities, often described as "dangling a carrot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This is a common trap that can lead people to stay in jobs longer than they should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The company may have been caught off guard, not expecting you to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Risks of Accepting a Counter Offer
*   **Target on Your Back**: Accepting a counter offer can make you a "flight risk" in your current employer's eyes, potentially marking you as more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. You might be seen as the most expensive person in your department, making you a target for future layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Increased Expectations**: With higher pay, there will be a higher level of expectation for your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Prior Recognition**: A counter offer often highlights that your value wasn't recognized until you were leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It suggests they might have been taking you for granted or underpaying you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Temporary Solution**: Sometimes, a counter offer is a tactic to buy the company time to find your replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Strategies for Resignation and Counter Offer Conversations

### Before Resigning
*   **Assess Your Market Value**: Regularly check the open market to understand your worth, even if it means taking an occasional interview to "keep things honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut**: Your intuition is a strong indicator of the best course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. If you have a good feeling about a new opportunity, trust it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### During the Resignation Process
*   **Maintain Control**: You are in the driver's seat when you have an acceptable offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Be Vague with Details**: When meeting with current leadership, hear them out, but do not disclose details about your new opportunity, such as salary, company name, or even the new job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   *Reason*: Some employers might try to "torpedo" your new offer behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Frame Your Departure Positively**: State that you are leaving because you were "pulled by an opportunity" rather than due to issues with your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This implies career growth rather than dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Don't Badmouth Your Employer**: Avoid sharing reasons for leaving that criticize your current company, such as not getting your best quality work or not being challenged, unless you are genuinely considering their counter offer and these are deal-breakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Insist on Documentation for Counter Offers**: If you were to consider a counter offer, it should be in writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> and include a solid pay bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Demand a new job title, level, responsibilities, job description, pay range, and an official offer letter from HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Evaluating a Potential Counter Offer
*   **New Job Title/Level**: Unless a counter offer comes with a new job title and potentially a new level, you should be very reluctant to accept it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. A simple pay bump makes you a more expensive version of your current self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Genuine Career Path**: If a company truly has plans for you at a senior or executive level, you should already be part of their succession planning program, receiving development, mentoring, and possibly further education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. If you are not part of such programs, their promises may not be sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.
*   **Company's Past Behavior**: Your current company's past behavior in how they've treated you and others is the best indicator of their future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.

### Honoring a New Job Commitment
*   **No Legal Obligation**: Even after signing an offer letter, you generally have no legal obligation to start a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. While reneging on an offer may upset the new recruiter, you must do what's best for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Career as CEO**: Think of yourself as the CEO of your own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Prioritize your own best interest.
*   **Don't Burn Bridges**: While moving on, it's wise to maintain professional relationships. If your current company promises a future leadership role, you can express interest in staying in touch and being considered if a genuine opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, making it clear you would expect seniority to be honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

The vast majority of the time, declining a counter offer is the best course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. The [[how_to_navigate_job_offers_and_counter_offers | decision]] to leave is usually based on factors beyond just salary, and a counter offer rarely addresses the underlying reasons for seeking a new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Remember, every company has issues, and the "grass isn't always greener," but strategically moving to a new role can offer the growth and recognition your current company failed to provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>.

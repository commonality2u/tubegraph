When an [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | employee]] raises concerns about another [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | employee]], their [[problems_with_a_micromanager_boss | boss]], or [[strategies_for_handling_a_toxic_work_environment | workplace]] conditions, they may acquire a reputation and a "target on their back" within the organization [00:07:10].

## [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]]'s Initial Response
When an [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | employee]] complains, the [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resource department]] may state they will investigate the matter [00:07:24]. However, their initial action is often to visit the complainant's [[problems_with_a_micromanager_boss | boss]] or the [[problems_with_a_micromanager_boss | boss]]'s [[problems_with_a_micromanager_boss | boss]] to discuss the [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | employee]] and their performance [00:07:28]. The [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] department will also typically review the [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | employee]]'s employment file to examine their history with the employer [00:07:35].

## Employee Perception and Consequences
While [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | employee]]s should still lodge legitimate complaints, caution is advised when approaching the [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | human resource department]] [00:07:41]. Often, the [[identifying_and_dealing_with_dishonest_and_gossiping_coworkers | employee]] who makes the complaint is subsequently labeled as the "troublemaker" [00:07:50]. This leads to [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | HR]] looking to limit the company's liability [00:07:55]. If complaints continue, [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | Human Resources]] may try to separate the situation but then work to remove what they consider to be the "root problem," which is often the person who initially lodged the complaint [00:08:08].

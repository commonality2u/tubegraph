Being extremely careful about what you say to coworkers in the workplace is crucial to avoid trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. As a former HR professional, Brian from Life After Layoff has compiled a list of common things that have led to people getting into trouble when they speak too freely to coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Do Not Disclose You Are in an Active Job Search

It's advisable to avoid telling coworkers if you are in an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Once you start discussing your job search, word can spread quickly, and whispers might begin at the water cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Inevitably, this information could reach your boss, senior leaders, or the HR department, which you typically want to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

If you are looking for a job and do not want your current employer to know, be cautious about where you place your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Avoid uploading an updated resume that shows your current company or job to resume databases like Indeed, or setting yourself as "available to work" on your LinkedIn profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Disclosing your job search widely could expedite your exit from the company, even if it's premature for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Avoid Negative Talk About Your Boss or Gossip

It's recommended to not say anything negative about your boss, even if you feel that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>. Even if you believe you have a trusted work ally who also complains about the boss, be very careful how you engage, as these conversations can come back to negatively affect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Similarly, refrain from gossiping about other coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:25">[02:34:25]</a>. You do not want to gain a reputation as a gossip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. If coworkers find out you are talking about them behind their back, they might file a complaint or go to management, drawing unwanted attention to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Regardless of how careful you are or how close your confidant is, the boss often finds out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Do Not Share Your Salary

While salary transparency is generally positive for creating a level playing field, sharing your salary with coworkers inside your company is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. If coworkers share their salaries, someone in the group may realize they are underpaid and become upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This could lead to an employee quitting or confronting the boss, demanding fairer compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

This situation can cause the boss to lose trust in you and others involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Even if there are legitimate reasons for pay differences (e.g., more skill, experience, or a changed job market), a lack of trust can hinder your career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. If you wish to share salary information, do so anonymously on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or TeamBlind (for tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. These platforms allow you to contribute to salary transparency without personal blowback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Avoid Borrowing Money

Borrowing money from coworkers is strongly advised against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:25">[04:24:25]</a>. Similar to the adage about not mixing business with family or friends, doing so with coworkers often leads to negative outcomes, particularly for the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Asking a coworker for money can create an uncomfortable situation for them, potentially leading them to report it to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. To avoid this drama, consider a side hustle if you are experiencing financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Be Careful with Compliments

Avoid complimenting coworkers on their physical attributes, even if you mean it innocently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:21">[05:01:21]</a>. You cannot know how the recipient will interpret it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. HR has received complaints where an innocent comment made a coworker feel uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. What matters is how the compliment is perceived, not your intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Keep compliments professional; for instance, commenting positively on a new hairdo is acceptable, but ensure it remains professional and not "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## Never Comment on Perceived Pregnancy

A significant workplace faux pas is commenting if you think someone is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. The two primary outcomes are that they are pregnant but not ready to disclose it, forcing them to expedite the announcement, or they are not pregnant at all, leading to offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Always allow the individual to take the lead in disclosing such personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## Keep Legal Matters Private

If you are involved in a major employee relations issue or considering legal action against the company, do not discuss it with coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Sharing details about your intentions to sue, company "dirt," or your legal strategy could lead to others taking notes that might be used to defend the company, or the company taking proactive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. If you are in the midst of litigation or plan to be, keep silent and only discuss it with your attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Avoid Off-Color Jokes

Do not tell off-color jokes to coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Such jokes frequently lead to complaints in HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. A joke intended innocently can be interpreted offensively by the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Again, it does not matter how you intended the joke; what matters is how it is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. It's best to stick to light-hearted "dad jokes" or keep jokes to a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## [[avoiding_political_and_sensitive_topics_at_work | Avoid Political Discussions]]

One of the most challenging things to avoid in the modern workplace is discussing politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Regardless of your stance on an issue or your political leanings, political conversations are hot-button topics that will likely offend someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. These discussions often end in arguments, and you are unlikely to convince the other person to change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. If you value your career and wish to avoid legal trouble, it is best to take the high road and treat coworkers with a high degree of professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. You can be friendly, but be very careful about what you say and disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

The current job market presents significant challenges for job seekers, with many experiencing frustration despite numerous applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This difficulty is compounded by certain types of job postings that can be misleading or unlikely to result in an external hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. As of early 2023, the job market feels "eerily similar to 2020," characterized by widespread layoffs and a significant imbalance between job supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Unfilled and Pipeline Requisitions

One issue observed in the job market is the existence of job requisitions (reqs) that companies have no immediate intention of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Aging Requisitions
Some hiring managers might post a job and then neglect it, allowing it to "collect dust" without any activity, even though job seekers continue to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While recruiters ideally should prompt hiring managers to close such inactive roles, this doesn't always happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Pipeline Requisitions
A more problematic category are [[fake_job_postings | pipeline requisitions]], which the speaker has "a pretty big issue with" due to their deceptive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: These are job postings specifically designed to "collect applications for the future" and build a pool of candidates, rather than to fill an immediate opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: In theory, they allow companies to move quicker when a role does open, but in practice, the speaker has "never actually seen a pipeline wreck work well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Deception**: Companies may post these as if they are actual jobs, making it difficult for job seekers to discern the difference from a genuine opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. They often collect resumes and then close the role without hiring anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Impact on Job Seekers**: [[candidate_experience_and_job_market_challenges | This practice]] can be very "off-putting" and cause significant "letdown" for job seekers, especially in a difficult job market, by raising hopes for roles that have no intention of being filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

#### Recognizing Pipeline Requisitions
While relatively rare, they do exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Example**: One example seen on LinkedIn was titled "Open Career Opportunities" by a major corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Red Flags**: [[recognizing_red_flags_in_job_postings | Red flags]] for [[identifying_lowquality_job_postings | identifying low-quality job postings]] like these include:
    *   Generic job titles like "Open Career Opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   A lack of specific job duties or a singular location, instead listing multiple locations and generic descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   No specific role to apply to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: For the 352 applicants to the example role, there was "almost no chance that any of them are going to get called" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Internal Candidate Hires
Another reason for the difficulty in securing a job, and one that is "probably a little bit more common," is when a posted job is ultimately filled by an internal applicant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Company Requirements**: Some organizations or positions have a requirement to conduct external recruitment even if they intend to fill the role internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This happens especially when companies are reluctant to add new headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Impact**: An external candidate might progress far in the process only to be removed because an internal candidate "cuts in front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Broader Context: Stiff Competition
These issues with job postings are exacerbated by the overall [[issues_with_the_current_job_market_and_hiring_practices | issues with the current job market and hiring practices]], particularly the stiff competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Since January 1, 2023, nearly 90,000 tech workers alone have been laid off, significantly increasing the labor supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Application Volume**: Recruiters are seeing hundreds to thousands of applications for desirable roles (e.g., a VP-level tech role received 700 applicants in 24 hours, and a remote tech recruiter position received 2,300 applicants in 24 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Need to Stand Out**: With such high volumes, job seekers must ensure they have a "well-optimized resume" to maximize their chances of being noticed for a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. There is always someone who might be "a little bit more qualified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

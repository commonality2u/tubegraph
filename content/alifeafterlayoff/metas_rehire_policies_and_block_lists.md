Companies, including Meta, maintain block lists or [[do_not_hire_lists_in_companies | do not hire lists]] that prevent former employees from being rehired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These lists create an invisible barrier in an already competitive job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## How Block Lists Were Discovered at Meta

A recent expos√© on Business Insider revealed that former Meta employees were blocked from rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The article, "Meta keeps block lists of exe employees and even help from a VP can't get you off of it," confirmed suspicions about such lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Many employees caught in Meta's 2022 layoffs were highly rated, often "exceeding expectations" on performance scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Their layoffs were presented as "business decisions" and not performance-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite being told by hiring managers that they were wanted back, human resources policies often intervened, leading to blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

One senior engineer, after applying for nearly 20 positions over a year, noticed a pattern: hiring managers would express interest and set up screening calls, but the company's internal recruiters would then ghost them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The engineer only learned they were deemed ineligible for rehire when a frustrated hiring manager investigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Meta's Internal Tracking Systems

Meta uses multiple internal systems to track rehire ineligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. These include:
*   A "non-regrettable attrition designation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
*   A "[[do_not_hire_lists_in_companies | do not hire flag]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

This information is typically stored in the HRIS (Human Resources Information System), where employment data is kept, rather than the applicant tracking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Recruiters often cannot directly see these flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. When considering a rehire, the human resources department is contacted for a "thumbs up or a thumbs down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Criteria for Blacklisting

Official criteria for rehire ineligibility at Meta reportedly include:
*   Reason for separation at the time of leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
*   Policy violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   Performance termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
*   Involuntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
*   "Rage quitting" or leaving without notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
*   Stealing confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   Last ratings prior to separation and other performance signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>

However, former managers claim they had broad discretion to add names to the list without documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. It was easy to blacklist someone if a manager "didn't like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Despite Meta's official statement about clear criteria, this does not always appear to be the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Once an individual is marked as "non-regrettable attrition," this designation can follow them permanently, even if the managers involved have left the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers

For former employees, the experience typically involves initial smooth communication with a recruiter, which then slows down significantly after deeper company interaction, leading to vague answers and eventual rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

Discovery often happens through third-party headhunting agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. An external recruiter might submit a candidate, only for the company to inform them that the individual is on a [[do_not_hire_lists_in_companies | do not hire list]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Meta's shift to declaring all layoffs as performance-based has created a "Scarlet Letter" effect, implying that anyone laid off from Meta in the last year was a poor performer, leading to potential [[impact_of_blacklisting_on_job_seekers | bias from hiring managers]] outside of Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Broader Blacklisting Practices

It's possible to be blacklisted even without having worked at a company before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Informal Blacklisting via Application Activity
Excessive applications for the same job or unrelated roles at a company can lead to an informal blacklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Staffing teams and hiring managers may see a candidate's application history and develop a bias against them if they've been rejected multiple times by other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. For example, one individual applied to 150 different jobs over two years and, despite being eligible to reapply, had functionally [[impact_of_blacklisting_on_job_seekers | blacklisted themselves]] due to the sheer volume of unsuccessful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Recycle Periods and Permanent Bans
Some companies, like Amazon, have "recycle periods" where candidates can reapply for different roles after a certain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. If a candidate failed a technical skill, they might be able to reapply after six months to practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. However, if they failed a "leadership principle" (behavior-based interview), there was often no recycling period, effectively banning them permanently from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### [[backdoor_references_in_hiring_practices | Backdoor References]]
Employers can also blacklist candidates through [[backdoor_references_in_hiring_practices | backdoor references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This occurs when someone on a hiring team contacts an informal reference from a candidate's past company to get an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. These references can sink a candidate's chances and potentially lead to being blacklisted altogether, often without the candidate's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

While [[do_not_hire_lists_in_companies | do not hire lists]] are used by some employers, including Meta, it's not considered a widespread practice to lose sleep over unless one specifically desires to work for Meta or similar big tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

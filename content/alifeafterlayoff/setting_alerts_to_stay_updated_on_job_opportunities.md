This method helps avoid the tedious task of repeatedly checking job boards and refreshing pages daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Benefits of Setting Job Alerts

Setting up job alerts offers several advantages:
*   **Time-saving** It significantly reduces the time spent manually searching for new postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Efficiency** Alerts ensure that new job postings relevant to your criteria are delivered directly to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Early Application Advantage** By receiving early notifications, you can be among the first applicants, which is generally preferable to applying late in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Applying early can be beneficial because candidates may have already been identified if you apply too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## How to Set Up Alerts

Most job boards and company applicant tracking systems (ATS) offer the functionality to set up alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Keyword and Job Type Alerts** You can typically set up alerts based on specific keywords or job types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Company-Specific Alerts** If you have a particular company of interest, you can often set up alerts directly through their ATS to be notified of new openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. These alerts will usually be sent via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

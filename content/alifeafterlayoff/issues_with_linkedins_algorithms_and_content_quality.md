While LinkedIn is widely considered the leading platform for professional networking and job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, many users find it to be "broken and cringy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. People express strong opinions, often describing profiles, jobs, and recruiters as "fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Despite these sentiments, LinkedIn holds significant influence over the job market, as it's where recruiters and companies operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## How Content Quality Declined

LinkedIn's impact on hiring significantly increased after 2008 with the introduction of company pages and job postings, combining professional networking with job search functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. By 2010, LinkedIn Recruiter became a primary tool for talent acquisition, enabling recruiters to precisely search profiles instead of just resumes in a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This shift moved hiring from passive job listings to active talent sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

This evolution has meant that hiring now emphasizes [[Effectively Networking on LinkedIn | networking]] and [[challenges_with_linkedins_networking_and_branding | personal branding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, with 87% of recruiters using LinkedIn to find talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. However, this has also led to significant issues with the platform's content.

### Algorithm Prioritization
LinkedIn's algorithms tend to prioritize posts that go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This often includes:
*   Emotionally charged or generic inspirational stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   Humble brags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
*   One-size-fits-all, generic advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

Conversely, thoughtful, nuanced, or critical voices are frequently drowned out, and attempts to share honest or complex perspectives often result in throttled reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The speaker notes that generic, high-level content receives high engagement, while valuable, step-by-step guidance gets "nearly crickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This environment makes it challenging for real professionals to stand out and build genuine credibility, as shallow content tends to dominate the feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## The "Professional Facebook" Problem
LinkedIn has increasingly gained a reputation for feeling like a "glorified professional Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The platform is often "littered with trolls, virtue signaling, engagement mills," and users arguing about politics, news, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. For example, discussions on leadership styles can devolve into extensive political debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This "noise" distracts from LinkedIn's intended purpose as a professional space for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> and can make users hesitant to engage due to fear of backlash, especially since employers can view posting history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Curating Your LinkedIn Feed
To combat the frustrations with LinkedIn's feed and content quality, it's advised to "curate it ruthlessly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

*   **Unfollow**: Accounts that post or repost irrelevant or low-quality content should be unfollowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Prioritize industry-specific groups or thought leaders who genuinely add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Block**: Use the block feature for toxic trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Maintain Authenticity**: Keep interactions authentic, professional, and career-focused to create a more enjoyable feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Conclusion
Despite its imperfections and areas for improvement, LinkedIn remains a necessity for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Nearly every major corporation extensively recruits on the platform, and it's considered the industry standard for recruiter outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. While the job board aspect has its challenges, the [[effectively_networking_on_linkedin | networking]] and [[challenges_with_linkedins_networking_and_branding | branding]] components make it valuable, even without a premium subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The key is to use it correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

Every individual is likely to make career mistakes at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Recognizing these common errors can help individuals avoid pain and better navigate their professional journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Many lessons are often learned the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Common Career Mistakes and Lessons Learned

### Realizing Mistakes Later in Your Career
A significant lesson often learned much later is that critical mistakes were made early in one's career, but not realized until years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These mistakes can include:
*   Staying in a job for too long or overstaying one's welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Failing to respond to a recruiter for an amazing job opportunity due to fear or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Accepting a job offer that was not the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Not making a geographical move that could have opened an entirely new career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Focusing too long on a specific job type or career vertical, only to realize it wasn't resonating and waiting too long to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

With the benefit of hindsight, it becomes clear that earlier career changes might have been beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Career coaching often reveals how individuals "went off the rails" with their career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This is particularly relevant when contemplating a [[strategies_for_career_control_and_adaptation | career change]] and unsure about timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### The Myth of Loyalty
Another hard-learned lesson is that [[balancing_company_loyalty_with_career_advancement | loyalty rarely pays off]] in career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Staying in a role too long out of loyalty to a leader or organization, expecting eventual promotion or a "dangling carrot," can lead to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

For example, an individual might join a company expecting a senior leader to retire, but the retirement never happens, leaving the individual stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This can result in:
*   The rest of the market moving beyond one's current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Falling years behind peers in terms of responsibility, level, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   Missing out on leadership career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Hard Work Does Not Always Lead to Promotions
While putting in long hours and "paying dues" may seem necessary, hard work alone does not guarantee promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The pressure to work excessively, especially under a workaholic boss, can lead to unrewarded effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Instead of working the most hours, it's crucial to "work the smartest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This means:
*   Working on highly visible projects that are important to your boss and their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   Focusing on tasks that senior leadership cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Advocating for Yourself
Part of the "game" of career advancement is advocating for oneself to the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Your boss often isn't the sole decision-maker for promotions; it's usually your boss's boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Therefore, it's vital to:
*   Find ways to be visible to your boss's boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   Be your own advocate, as no one else in the organization will likely do it for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Act as the "CEO of your career," which involves wearing multiple hats, including serving as your own marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This means creating campaigns to market your effectiveness within the company, department, and job, as well as on the open market during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### The Importance of Relevant Skills
While being very good at a specific thing can be a competitive advantage, [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_advancement | relevant skills]] are more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Employers value certain skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. If a skill becomes obsolete or is not valued by other companies in the industry, an individual can find themselves with a resume full of irrelevant skills, leading to stagnation and settling for lower-quality jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The key is to focus on relevant skills that are highly in demand by more than one employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### "What Have You Done for Me Lately?"
Goodwill built up from past achievements is typically very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In environments like layoffs, contributions from even a major project completed last year may only buy a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Senior leaders primarily care about what you can produce in the future, not necessarily what you are producing today or have produced in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This "cold and cutthroat" reality often baffles individuals who felt their loyalty and past work should protect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Career Control
To navigate these challenges and ensure [[longterm_career_alignment | long-term career alignment]], individuals should:
*   Act like a "free agent" in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   Prioritize themselves first in their career, even before the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   Develop all necessary "hats" required to be the "CEO of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

This involves reclaiming control and approaching one's career with more strategy, ultimately taking ownership of professional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_stability | Strategies for career resilience and stability]] necessitate a proactive stance rather than passive loyalty.

To effectively convey information in your resume, focus on clarity, conciseness, and customization for each specific role you apply to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The ultimate goal is to present your best self to potential employers and secure job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The advice shared comes from a corporate recruiter's perspective, considering how resumes are screened quickly (often a 5-second glance) and what hiring managers look for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. There isn't one "right" way to write a resume, but if your current resume isn't yielding desired results, it's time for a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Opt for Simple, ATS-Friendly Templates

Avoid using outdated or overly designed templates, especially those found on sites like Canva.com or generic resume hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These templates, often created by graphic designers, can distract from the main purpose of quickly conveying information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Moreover, graphic designers typically don't understand [[improving_resume_format_for_applicant_tracking_systems | how applicant tracking systems (ATS) work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Instead, opt for simple, clean templates:
*   **Source**: A basic Microsoft Word template is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Layout**: Choose a one-column format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics**: Avoid bright, flashy colors and graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Use clean, easy-to-read fonts and basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For most jobs, your resume should be "relatively boring" in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Exception**: A more creative approach might be acceptable if you are a graphic designer or in a similar creative field, where such a presentation might be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

#### Optimize Contact Information for ATS

Ensure your contact information is listed vertically, not horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. [[improving_resume_format_for_applicant_tracking_systems | Applicant tracking systems]] often struggle to parse horizontal data effectively, leading to manual data entry for applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Profile, Don't Summarize

Instead of creating a summary of every accomplishment in your career, focus on "profiling" your resume for a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This means delivering exactly what the employer is seeking, rather than hoping they find something they like within a broad summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Concentrate on what hiring teams actually care about, not irrelevant accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Customization is Crucial

[[optimizing_and_customizing_resumes_for_job_applications | Customizing your resume]] for each application is critically important, especially in today's competitive job market and for highly sought-after remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Many applicants are "lazy" and do not customize, which presents a competitive advantage for those who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Be Concise and Clear

Avoid wordy resumes with large blocks of text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers are likely to skip over resumes that are hard to scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Be selective with your words and how they are laid out on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

#### Avoid Proprietary Language

Do not use internal company-specific jargon, project names, division names, or product types that are only known by your current or previous employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Boil down concepts into clear, common language relevant to the industry you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

#### Eliminate Generic "Fluffy" Terminology

Remove overused and generic phrases like "team player" or "great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. These terms often make recruiters "roll their eyes" and don't effectively convey your fit for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Instead, focus on actionable terms and concepts that directly relate to the job you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit, not to impress with an elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Adjust and Iterate

If your resume is not yielding the results you desire (e.g., repeated rejections at the application level), be willing to redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This is particularly true if you believe you have a clear fit for the jobs you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Your resume needs to clearly convey that fit to give you the best chance at an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

The Human Resources (HR) department often faces criticism, and sometimes, this reputation is deserved due to "shady" practices, particularly concerning layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While HR at lower organizational levels can be a good ally, and some HR professionals genuinely care about the employee experience, the department's primary function is to limit company liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## HR's Obsession with Documentation
HR is "utterly obsessed" with documenting every aspect of the employment arrangement, from the initial application to the exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This includes:
*   Application disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Offer letter terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Orientation training and policy acknowledgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   Employee handbook receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   Documented coaching sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Exit documents, especially severance packages with their terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

This extensive documentation is designed to limit company liability and potentially build a case against an employee if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Shady Practices Related to Layoffs

### Confidential Job Postings
A common "shady" practice is the use of confidential job postings, where the company name is blanked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Purpose** The most frequent reason for a confidential job posting is that the company is actively [[handling_layoffs_and_terminations_at_companies | replacing]] the current incumbent, who is unaware they are being replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Strategy** This allows the company to get a head start on replacing an employee without causing internal disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. They may wait to terminate the existing employee until a replacement has been hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Misleading Communication on Layoffs
HR departments often mislead employees about impending layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. If HR formally states that layoffs are *not* being considered, it can be guaranteed that they are being considered at that exact moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This directly impacts [[corporate_trust_and_transparency_during_layoffs | corporate trust and transparency]].

### Using Self-Assessments for Layoff Criteria
Before [[criteria_companies_use_for_employee_layoffs | layoffs]], HR may ask employees to rank their own performance and [[role_of_skills_and_departmental_need_in_layoffs | skill set]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Deceptive Intent** This is often presented under the guise of understanding the workforce or allocating resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Actual Use** In reality, HR is assessing if an employee's skills align with the company's long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Simultaneously, they meet with managers to discuss team performance and review various metrics, including performance output and ratings, to determine who will be included on the layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Employees should be cautious if asked to self-rank and consider updating their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Poor Execution of Layoffs
The handling of layoffs by HR departments has been consistently poor in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Despite public criticism, HR often continues to mishandle terminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Common examples of poor execution include:
*   Notifying employees via Zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>
*   Shutting off access to equipment without prior notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>
*   Not explicitly notifying employees, who only realize their employment ended when they cannot access the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>

This poor execution negatively impacts [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | employees]] and demonstrates a lack of [[human_resources_role_and_communication_during_layoffs | communication and dignity]] in the process, despite available [[strategies_for_mitigating_layoff_impacts | strategies for mitigating layoff impacts]].

### Call for Improvement
There is a significant need for HR leaders to improve their approach to layoffs by treating people with dignity and humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This involves pushing back on leadership teams that do not prioritize these values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

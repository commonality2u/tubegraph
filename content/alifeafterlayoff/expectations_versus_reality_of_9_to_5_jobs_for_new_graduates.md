From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

The transition from college life to a full-time 9-to-5 job can be a stark reality check for recent graduates, often leading to a significant [[the disconnect between college life and the modern workforce | disconnect]] between expectations and the demands of the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This shift in perception is highlighted by a viral TikTok post from a recent college graduate expressing her distress over the realities of her first full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Recent Graduate's Experience

A recent college graduate's TikTok video, made after starting her first 9-to-5 job post-college, went viral due to her candid upset about the schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. She articulated several key frustrations:
*   **Long Commutes** Working in person and commuting to the city meant leaving home by 7:30 AM and not returning until 6:15 PM or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This extensive commute made it difficult to afford living in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Time and Energy** The long hours and commute left no time or energy for personal activities like cooking dinner, working out, or socializing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Struggles** Despite having a degree and internships, she felt she wasn't making enough to live comfortably, save, or even build an emergency fund, with most of her income going towards living expenses and commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. She highlighted that the salaries offered to college graduates often aren't sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

## The Harsh Reality of the Modern Workforce

Compared to college, where responsibilities are fewer, entering the workplace reveals that the 9-to-5 grind often defines the majority of one's adult life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Many younger generations, particularly Generation Z, may be less prepared for this reality than previous generations who perhaps had different [[employer_expectations_for_recent_college_graduates | expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

While remote work offers the advantage of eliminating commutes, thus theoretically freeing up time, many remote workers find they still work longer hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that the current balance of work and life is unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, hoping for a future where lives are less tied to demanding work schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Post-TikTok Layoff
The recent graduate who posted the TikTok video was subsequently laid off from her first post-graduate job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. She attributed her layoff to working for a startup that lacked the workload or bandwidth to properly train her or provide sufficient tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This incident underscores the [[current_challenges_in_the_job_market | challenges in the job market]], especially for those early in their careers without extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

The timing of her layoff, right before the holidays, further complicated her job search, as hiring processes slow down significantly from mid-December to mid-January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

## Navigating [[Challenges in the current job market for entrylevel candidates | The Job Market for New Graduates]]

The current job market, characterized by significant fluctuations and a "whiplash" effect, is particularly difficult for Generation Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. New graduates face [[financial_challenges_and_job_instability_faced_by_new_graduates | financial challenges]] and job instability, often needing to secure employment immediately due to a lack of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Starting a career in expensive cities like New York City can be especially difficult due to extraordinary living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Strategies for Control
To mitigate these challenges, new graduates are encouraged to take control of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This can involve:
*   **[[exploring_alternatives_to_traditional_9_to_5_employment_and_the_role_of_side_hustles | Side Hustles]]** Developing additional income streams or "side hustles" can provide a financial buffer and prevent being forced into a "crappy job" out of desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **Career Planning** Strategic planning from the early stages of a career is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Rather than simply "winging it," a well-thought-out approach can help avoid pitfalls later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

## The Value of College Versus Debt
The discussion also raises questions about the financial viability of a college education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Graduates are finding themselves in significant debt, facing high interest rates, while the salaries offered for entry-level positions may not allow them to get ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This creates a difficult cycle where individuals need to work hard but still struggle to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

## Generation Z and the Future of Work
Generation Z is poised to bring significant changes to the workplace, with new ideas that could revolutionize how work is approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. While there is a current [[the_disconnect_between_college_life_and_the_modern_workforce | disconnect]], finding a balance between contributing effectively, maintaining independence, and taking responsibility will be key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. The future of the workplace, shaped by this new generation, promises to be interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

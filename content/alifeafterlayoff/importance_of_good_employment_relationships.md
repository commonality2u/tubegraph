Quitting a job professionally is crucial for maintaining a positive [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employment brand]] and opening doors for future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. As a corporate recruiter and HR professional with over 20 years of experience, it's advised to leave with grace and dignity, regardless of the reason for departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Wrong Way to Quit
Storming out, kicking a computer, or telling an employer to "take this job and shove it" is the wrong approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Such actions will likely result in:
*   Ineligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Burning bridges with the current employer and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Potentially being viewed as a "loose cannon" by former [[building_relationships_at_work | work friends]], making them unlikely to provide future referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Only temporary satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Instead, always "take the high road" and remain professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Preparing to Quit Your Job
Before announcing your departure, it's vital to have all your "ducks in a row" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This includes:
*   Having a confirmed start date with your new employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Ensuring all pre-employment checks (e.g., drug screens, background checks, references) are complete and the results are back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Delays in background checks can take weeks, and offers can be pulled if issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Maintain Confidentiality
Keep your job search discreet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Do not inform work friends or colleagues about your plans until you are absolutely ready to move on and have secured another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Leaks can result in you being out of a job sooner than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Delivering Your Notice
Once you have a confirmed start date with your new role, follow these steps:
1.  **Meet Your Boss First**: Set up a face-to-face meeting or a video call to inform your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Avoid sending an email or text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Your boss should always be the first to know, not through office rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
2.  **Keep it Brief and Professional**: State that you have found another opportunity that is the best move for your family and thank them for the time and opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Avoid giving extensive details, elaborating on grievances, or criticizing management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This prevents emotional escalation and a "powder keg" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Your decision should be firm, and you should not entertain counter offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
3.  **Give Two Weeks' Notice**: Provide at least two weeks' notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This allows time to tie up loose ends and facilitate a smooth transition for your colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. While not legally required, it's a courtesy to those who will take on your workload, not just the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
4.  **Coordinate Communication with Colleagues**: Ask your boss for the appropriate time to inform co-workers, clients, or customers about your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Following proper protocol leaves a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
5.  **Grace and Appreciation**: When speaking with colleagues and clients, acknowledge that your departure will create additional work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Be appreciative and avoid trashing the company, your boss, or the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Focus on positive aspects like growth opportunities and positive team experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Building and Maintaining Relationships
*   **Thank Influential People**: Directly contact those who were instrumental in your career (e.g., trainers, mentors, those who gave you opportunities) and give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Expand Your Network**: Ask these individuals to join your professional network, especially on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Strong networks are crucial for finding future job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Quitting poorly jeopardizes these valuable networking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Leave the Door Cracked Open**: If comfortable, you can ask your current boss if there's an opportunity to be considered for rehire if your new role doesn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Maintaining good terms with former bosses is important for references and future opportunities, as they may move to new companies and call you to join them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

The way you treat people when you leave an organization will reflect on you and follow you throughout your entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Always aim to leave on good terms and create a great impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

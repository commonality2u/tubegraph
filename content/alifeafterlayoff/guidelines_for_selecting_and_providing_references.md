When applying for a job, you may be asked to provide references. Understanding how these references are used and the best way to select and prepare them can significantly impact your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## When Reference Checks Occur

Reference checks are a part of the hiring process, though their prevalence can vary by company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

*   **Smaller Companies and Agencies**: It is common for smaller companies or agencies submitting candidates to larger corporations to require and follow through on reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These companies are more likely to verify your provided references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Larger Corporations**: Many larger companies are reluctant to provide detailed references due to [[liability_concerns_with_providing_references | liability concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Their human resources departments often limit information to only "name, rank, and serial number" â€“ meaning they will only confirm the employee's name, dates of employment, and job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They generally do not disclose compensation, rehire eligibility, or reasons for termination to avoid potential legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Employees in larger companies are often instructed to redirect all reference requests to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## The Reference Check Process

When a company checks a reference, they typically contact your provided reference and ask a series of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These questions often cover:
*   Your job-related skills and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Your work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Attendance (especially for hourly positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   Any concerns the employer should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Your strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Eligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

Tracking down references and getting them to return calls can sometimes delay the [[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | hiring process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Guidelines for Providing References

If you are asked for references, take it seriously and follow these key guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>:

1.  **Choose Legitimate and Relevant Professional References**:
    *   **Direct Manager**: Ideally, include at least one professional reference who was a direct manager you reported to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Getting three managers as references is considered the best option for valid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   **Customers or Senior Colleagues**: If you cannot provide multiple managers, choose someone who was a customer you directly supported (internal or external), or a colleague who was a level or two above you and can speak to your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Peers**: Do not list a peer who performed the same job as you; this is generally not as strong a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

2.  **Ensure a Positive Reference**:
    *   Only provide references from people who will give you a good recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   It's crucial to know your working relationships well enough to anticipate a positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Receiving a lukewarm or negative reference can complicate the hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

3.  **Obtain Permission and Inform Your References**:
    *   Always ask for permission from a person before listing them as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Inform them that you are interviewing and that they might receive a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This prevents them from mistaking the call for spam and ensures they are prepared to respond promptly, which can speed up the [[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | hiring process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Impact on Hiring Process

While reference checks are a required step in some processes, especially with smaller companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, many major employers do not heavily weight them due to [[liability_concerns_with_providing_references | liability concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Often, it serves as a final check-off step before an offer is extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. If you reach the reference check stage, it's generally a positive sign that an offer is likely coming soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

"Ghost job postings" or "pipelining wrecks" refer to job listings that employers publish without a genuine intent to fill the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>. These postings are primarily used to collect resumes for future recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>.

## Reasons for Pipelining Wrecks

Employers engage in pipelining for various reasons, as revealed by a Clarify Capital survey of 1045 managers involved in hiring (conducted August 31st - September 1st, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:04">[04:22:04]</a>:

*   **Always Open to New Talent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:04">[06:57:04]</a>: Fifty percent of managers keep job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:04">[06:57:04]</a>, treating it like "window shopping" for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:04">[07:25:04]</a>.
*   **Building an Active Candidate Pool** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:04">[09:19:04]</a>: To have a pool of candidates ready in case of employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:04">[09:20:04]</a>.
*   **Seeking Irresistible Candidates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:04">[09:42:04]</a>: Some employers just "cast their line" hoping a perfect candidate applies with minimal effort on their part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:04">[09:46:04]</a>.
*   **Misleading Impressions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:04">[08:02:04]</a>:
    *   To give the impression that the company is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:04">[08:02:04]</a>. This can be deceitful to both job candidates and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:04">[08:29:04]</a>.
    *   To placate overworked current employees by suggesting help is on the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:04">[10:05:04]</a>. This is considered "particularly sinister" as it tricks employees who are likely already overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:04">[10:07:04]</a>.
*   **Poor Management/Oversight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:04">[08:57:04]</a>:
    *   The job was filled, but the posting was not removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:04">[08:57:04]</a>, indicating a "lazy recruiter or lazy HR person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:04">[10:40:04]</a>.
    *   No particular reason given, implying they "simply don't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:04">[10:47:04]</a>.
*   **Ambiguous Hiring Plans** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:04">[06:27:04]</a>: Employers may post jobs but are unsure of their headcount or if layoffs will impact hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:04">[06:33:04]</a>.

## Impact on Candidates

The rise of ghost job postings contributes to a "perfect storm" for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:04">[04:13:04]</a>, creating several negative impacts:

*   **Wasted Time and Effort** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:04">[02:24:04]</a>: Candidates spend valuable time crafting applications and highly targeted, custom resumes for positions that do not genuinely exist or have no intention of being filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>.
*   **Poor [[impact_of_poor_candidate_experience|Candidate Experience]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:04">[02:11:04]</a>: Recruiters and talent acquisition leaders often "lose sight of the [[impact_of_poor_candidate_experience|candidate experience]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:04">[02:43:04]</a>, failing to put themselves in the job seeker's shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:04">[02:49:04]</a>.
*   **Emotional Toll** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:04">[03:06:04]</a>: Job seekers become "anxiously refreshing their screen [and] email" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:04">[03:06:04]</a> for a response that will never come, leading to frustration and disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:04">[03:15:04]</a>.
*   **Misleading Job Market Perceptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:04">[03:27:04]</a>: The official "record number of job openings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a> often includes contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that do not offer benefits or represent "career type jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:04">[03:35:04]</a>. This creates a disconnect for job seekers who are told the market is "robust" but are not seeing legitimate opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:04">[03:48:04]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Pipelining Wrecks

Job seekers can implement strategies to avoid falling victim to ghost job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:04">[10:53:04]</a>:

*   **Check Posting Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:04">[11:02:04]</a>: If a job has been listed for over six months, it's likely a ghost wreck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:04">[11:05:04]</a>. Repeatedly re-posted listings over a long period are also a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:04">[11:11:04]</a>.
*   **Due Diligence and Reverse Reference Checks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:04">[11:32:04]</a>:
    *   Investigate if the company recently had major layoffs, especially in roles similar to the posted job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:04">[11:37:04]</a>. If so, the company may be trying to build a pipeline for future rehiring, indicating a lack of loyalty to that job type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:04">[11:47:04]</a>.
    *   A company that behaves shadily with job postings is likely not one you want to work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:04">[08:51:04]</a>.
*   **Analyze Job Description Detail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:04">[12:01:04]</a>:
    *   Genuine job postings usually have a lot of detail, including specifics about accomplishments, responsibilities, and who the role supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:04">[12:06:04]</a>.
    *   Pipelining wrecks tend to be generic, focusing on salesy company descriptions rather than specific roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:04">[12:22:04]</a>. A generic job description is a "pretty big red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:04">[12:29:04]</a>.
*   **Consider Recency of Post** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:04">[12:32:04]</a>: A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an active recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:04">[12:33:04]</a>.

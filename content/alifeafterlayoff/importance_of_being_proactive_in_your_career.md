The core message is to [[importance_of_acting_like_a_free_agent_in_your_career | act like the CEO of your career]] and take ownership, rather than passively waiting for opportunities to come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## A Personal Story: The Perils of Passivity

Early in his career, the speaker was recruited into a railroad services company with approximately 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His role as Staffing and Development Manager evolved into a Human Resources Manager position, providing valuable experience and impact on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The primary reason for accepting the role was a promise of promotion: he was told the VP of HR would retire in 18 months, and he would be groomed to take over the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The company environment was described as family-oriented and laid-back, with a high degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. However, the VP, who had an old-school approach but high empathy for employees, consistently delayed his retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. After 18 months, it became evident the VP had no intention of leaving, enjoying his "little kingdom" and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The speaker was part of a leadership development group, being groomed for senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, the existing senior leadership clung to their positions, often convincing themselves that nobody below them was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
His boss specifically told him, "you're not ready yet," while offering no real development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Danger of Apathy
> While his peers in the leadership development group started leaving for better opportunities (some becoming presidents of competitor companies), the speaker remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. He became apathetic and comfortable, collecting a steady paycheck and waiting for the promised promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This passivity led him to stop pushing for growth or seeking new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. What was supposed to be 18 months turned into nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

After about seven years, he gave up on his initial dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Another senior leader recognized his talent in other areas like marketing and photography, leading him to transition out of HR for his last two years at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The original VP of HR finally retired two years after the speaker left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## The High Cost of Passivity

The speaker regrets how he handled his [[career_management_and_planning | career management and planning]], admitting he was not acting like the CEO of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. By staying too long, he "became Joe," a reference to a video about why steady jobs can be bad for careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[comparing_proactive_versus_passive_career_management | Comparing Proactive vs. Passive Career Management]]
> The "astute" members of his succession planning group left after two or three years, refusing to wait for recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The speaker, however, remained apathetic, waiting for opportunities instead of actively seeking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

This inaction set him back significantly, potentially a decade, compared to his peers who were moving into senior director roles while he was stuck at a manager level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Being repeatedly told "you're not ready" made him start to believe it, despite his peers proving they were capable by thriving elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

He lost his passion for the HR role, going into "autopilot" and no longer caring about going above and beyond or volunteering for new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Becoming too comfortable led him to stop making decisions in the best interest of his long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

> I was literally I was playing checkers with my career not chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

He stopped learning and keeping up with industry trends, technology, and buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. When he re-entered the open market, he realized he was behind his peer group in skills, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. He had to take a step down in responsibility to gain the necessary recruiting experience at larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This mistake cost him thousands of dollars in lost income, as his compensation was far below market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Why [[proactive_career_management_strategies | Proactive Career Management]] is Crucial

The moral of the story is the [[importance_of_career_strategy_and_planning | importance of career strategy and planning]]. To achieve something in your career, you must "start learning how to play chess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This means taking ownership and not letting opportunities merely come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

> [!TIP] Act Like a CEO
> If you're stuck, dissatisfied, or frustrated, you need to be the CEO of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This involves:
> *   Not spending too much time in one organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
> *   Not waiting for recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
> *   Not allowing a company to keep you stuck because you're "too good" in your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
> *   Consistently testing the open market and entertaining other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

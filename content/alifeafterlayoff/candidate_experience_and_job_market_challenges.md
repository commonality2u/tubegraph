Despite widespread job listings, many are "ghost postings" or fake job advertisements that employers have no real intention of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon, known as ghost postings, is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The Paradox of the Current Job Market

The [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | current job market]] presents conflicting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While the FED states the job market is robust with a record number of job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, major corporations are continuously announcing layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This situation, where record numbers of jobs exist alongside layoffs and seemingly unfilled positions, doesn't add up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

It appears the employment pendulum has swung back to the employer, leading to practices like forcing employees back into the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The overall behavior of employers regarding layoffs has also been described as poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## What Are Ghost Postings?

A ghost posting is a job advertisement that an employer posts with no real intention of ever filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A specific type of ghost posting is a "pipelining wreck," which is posted to collect resumes for a future date without current intent to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The goal is to build a candidate pool to have a head start when they do decide to recruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Pipelining wrecks exist, with one example found for a company that recently had massive layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Prevalence of Ghost Job Postings

A survey by Clarify Capital, conducted between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, interviewed 1045 managers involved in hiring about ghost jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
Key findings include:
*   68% of managers had job postings active for more than 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. While many highly skilled positions take longer than 30 days to fill, some jobs are open for exceptionally long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   One in ten hiring managers had a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   One in five managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   50% of managers kept job postings open because they are "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

The fact that employers plan to fill active jobs several months down the road indicates ambiguity in hiring plans, possibly tied to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. If this is the case, it is suggested that companies should pull the job posting down rather than continue collecting resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs

The most common reasons employers are not actively trying to fill a position:
*   **Company is always open to new people (50%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>: This means they keep job requisitions (reqs) open to see who applies, akin to "window shopping" without a firm intention to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>: The logic behind this is unclear, as it could involve deceiving employees about open positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>: This practice is considered deceitful to both job candidates and investors, potentially having legal implications from an SEC perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Such companies are not recommended to work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **The job was filled but not pulled down** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>: This is considered a recruiter or HR oversight, as the requisition should be closed once filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates in case of turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>: Companies maintain candidate pools just as individuals should always keep their resumes updated and be open to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **In case an "irresistible" candidate applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>: This is labeled as lazy and irresponsible recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **To placate overworked employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>: This is seen as a sinister tactic, falsely promising help (the "cavalry") to overloaded employees who might be considering quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Forgot to delete the job** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>: This is simply a sign of a lazy recruiter or HR person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **No particular reason; they simply don't care** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers

The existence of ghost postings, combined with a misleading perception of a robust job market, creates [[challenges for job seekers in todays market | challenges for job seekers in today's market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The total number of reported job openings is considered misleading, as many are contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that may not offer benefits or be considered "career type" jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Job seekers often hear the market is great but struggle to find suitable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Pipelining wrecks, in particular, contribute to a poor [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Laid-off individuals are not interested in being "jerked around" by jobs with no intention of being filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Job seekers invest significant time in crafting targeted resumes and applications, only to find no one is genuinely considering their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Employers often lose sight of the [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] and fail to empathize with job seekers who eagerly await responses to limited opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Ghost Jobs

To avoid falling victim to ghost requisitions, consider the following:
*   **Posting Date**: If a job has been up for more than six months, it's likely a ghost wreck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Repeatedly posted requisitions over a long period also indicate a potential ghost job or a problematic hiring manager/high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Company Research**: Conduct due diligence and "reverse reference checks" on the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Check if they recently had major layoffs, especially in the same positions they are now advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. A company that has already shown disloyalty to specific roles might not be a desirable employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Job Description Detail**: Read the job description carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. More detail, specifics about accomplishments, and reporting structures indicate a more serious requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Pipelining wrecks often read generically, focusing on the company rather than a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Generic descriptions are a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Recency of Post**: A job posted within the last week is more likely to be actively recruited for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

Job seekers are encouraged to treat themselves as "free agents" and "CEOs of their career," focusing only on high-quality roles with legitimate employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

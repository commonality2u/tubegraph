The conventional wisdom often emphasizes the value of company loyalty, stability, and hard work, ingraining in us the idea of "paying our dues" and being a "company guy" or "gal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While these are not inherently bad characteristics, an overreliance on them can ultimately harm one's career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. In fact, a stable job can be detrimental if not managed strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Loyalty: Joe's Story

Joe's experience illustrates the potential downsides of excessive company loyalty and passivity in career management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### A Career of Steady Progress (or Lack Thereof)
Joe began his career as an entry-level accountant right out of school, even earning his CPA a few years in with aspirations to lead a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. For several years, he received decent reviews and saw his salary slowly increase through annual merit raises, occasionally taking on projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Missed Opportunities and Stagnation
When his boss, who had hired him, left the organization, Joe applied for the vacant role, hoping for a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, his company viewed him as a "good, solid worker bee" but lacked confidence in his leadership potential, ultimately hiring someone externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Joe continued to "plug away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A few years later, a new entry-level grad was hired at only $8,000 less than Joe, despite his many years of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Joe justified his compensation by focusing on benefits like his nearly vested 401k, a third week of vacation, and an upcoming bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The Brutal Truth of Layoffs
After 10 years at the company, having "paid his dues," Joe felt secure when rumors of downsizing began circulating, believing his long tenure and knowledge made him invaluable and "next in line" for a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Despite his loyalty and perceived value, Joe was laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This instant erased years of dedicated service and company loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Realizing the Career Gap
After the layoff, Joe realized that peers five years younger than him had already achieved the promotions he aspired to in similar companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. He was now at least five years behind his peer group and needed to rapidly catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. [[impacts_of_being_too_comfortable_in_one_job | Staying in his position]] for so long had actually [[common_career_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them | hurt him]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Joe is considered an "average candidate"—steady but unspectacular. While he possesses the necessary skills and has had minor successes, he is not aggressive in seeking opportunities, preferring to wait for them to come to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This passive approach causes candidates to blend into the crowd, competing against hundreds of similar applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Jill's Approach: The Superstar Candidate

In contrast to Joe, Jill represents the "superstar candidate" who proactively manages her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Strategic Career Planning
Jill, also an entry-level accountant, knew early on that she wanted to lead a finance team and began creating a master plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This plan included:
*   **Obtaining Certifications**: She immediately pursued her CPA certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Gaining Experience**: She identified projects that could improve her department and presented them to her manager, quickly gaining more responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Networking and Visibility**: Jill actively networked with other departmental heads, gaining visibility and even joining project groups outside her immediate team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Her reputation as someone to know spread quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Proactive Career Moves
Jill earned a promotion to a team lead role with a modest salary increase, gaining valuable leadership experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. However, she recognized that her boss was a "lifer" who would [[impact_of_a_bad_boss_on_career_progression | block her upward mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Although she enjoyed her company, they couldn't offer the next step she needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

At an industry event, she mentioned her career feeling blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Within months, her network connected her to a new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. After just three years, Jill moved to a major corporation, gaining a 30% pay raise and the leadership position her previous boss had blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This calculated move provided the exact experience needed for her continued career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. In just three years, Jill surpassed Joe in level, experience, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Jill's story demonstrates that loyalty is valued, but not to the point of being detrimental to one's career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Core Principles for Career Progression

### Define Your Career Goals
It's crucial to define your career goals, whether you're new to your career or mid-career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Without a clear path, you risk a series of uninspired roles and progressions, becoming an "average joe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. If you're mid-career and haven't found your goal, consider if you're in the wrong career path altogether and contemplate a change to something you're more passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Jill's success stemmed from knowing exactly what she wanted and ensuring every move was targeted toward that end goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This clarity streamlines your job search by avoiding non-value-added positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Adopt a "Free Agent" Mentality
Consider yourself a "free agent" in the job market, similar to professional athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Free agents offer their services to teams that provide the best opportunity, constantly honing their skills to increase their market value and command better opportunities and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. They aim to be starters in major markets, ensuring the company makes a significant investment in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

You are in control of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Your career skills—the knowledge and abilities you acquire—are transferable from employer to employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Remember, you owe a company a fair effort for fair pay, but not unquestioning loyalty beyond your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Since you don't have an agent, you must create opportunities for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Strategic Job Transitions
Adopting a free agent mentality doesn't mean [[challenges_with_job_hopping_and_resume_instability | hopping jobs]] every time you face a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. It's essential to:
*   **Learn the position and required skills**: This is critical for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Develop skills and network**: Understand the company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

However, if you're truly ready for the next step and your current company cannot provide that opportunity, it's a sign to update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

A person who leaves a position solely for a "few extra bucks" without a clear career progression is perceived as a [[challenges_with_job_hopping_and_resume_instability | job hopper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. In contrast, someone who leaves for a **calculated career progression** will not be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Recruiters understand when a company lacks the necessary opportunities or mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Every position you accept, even a lateral move, should have a strong, clear purpose in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Managing Salary and Compensation
Income is a primary motivator for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Ensuring you add value will lead to increased income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It's important to:
*   **Stay current on salary trends**: Research market rates to ensure fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Ask for raises**: If you have performance results and data to back it up, don't be ashamed to ask for a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

A [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | brutal truth]] is that staying at the same company and in the same position for a long time will almost certainly cause you to lag behind the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Most companies offer annual merit increases of only 1-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. However, a promotional opportunity or moving to a new company with a promotion can result in a 10-30% pay bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The market often passes by those who stay too long, unless they receive significant internal promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

If you prioritize a steady paycheck over career growth, staying in a stable job is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. However, if you find yourself undercompensated, blocked from achieving your goals, or your career momentum stalled, it's time to re-evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Proactive individuals who actively pursue opportunities will reach their career goals faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Being a "superstar candidate" also reduces the likelihood of facing unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

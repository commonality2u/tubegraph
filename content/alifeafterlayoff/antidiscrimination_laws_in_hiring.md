A recent LinkedIn post by a talent acquisition manager highlighted an "unbelievable" job application form from an international company recruiting for a US-based remote role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Despite the company's international location, if it advertises and solicits candidates from the United States, it must adhere to US anti-discrimination laws and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This form, verified as real, was sent by the company's HR department, prompting concern about potential legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags in the Hiring Process

Several indicators suggest a potentially low-quality employer, a scam, or a highly unprofessional organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>:
*   **HR handling Talent Acquisition** If a large corporation's hiring is managed directly by Human Resources instead of a dedicated talent acquisition department, it can be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** The absence of an ATS system and the manual sending of application forms is another red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Requests for Payment or Cashing Checks** Job seekers should be highly wary if asked to cash checks or pay for anything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, as this is a common sign of a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Candidates should vet such opportunities, cross-reference information with the company's corporate website, and ensure actual people are working there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Common [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | Illegal Questions in Job Applications]]

The discussed application form contained numerous questions that are illegal under US anti-discrimination laws. Understanding these helps job seekers [[avoiding_predatory_job_offers | avoid predatory job offers]] and employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Marital or Civil Status
Asking about one's civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, or if one has a significant other) is illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This information has no bearing on an individual's ability to perform a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Family Status, Children, and Childcare
Inquiring about whether an applicant has children, the number of minors, or childcare arrangements is illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Employers have been known to discriminate against individuals with children, fearing they might take more time off due to illness or childcare needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. US laws prohibit discrimination based on family status, pregnancy, or family planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Proper Inquiry:** Instead of asking about family, an employer can state the position's required work schedule and ask if the applicant can meet that condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Nationality, Passport, and Country of Origin
Directly asking for nationality, passports held, country of birth, or country of origin is illegal in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This is directly addressed in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Proper Inquiry:** The only relevant question is whether the applicant is legally able to work in the country without sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Asking about a current location (city and country) is valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Age
Requesting an applicant's age for visa purposes is illegal in a US application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This practice is linked to [[age_bias_and_discrimination_in_the_job_market | age bias and discrimination in the job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. If an international company's home country laws require age disclosure for visa purposes, they may need to re-evaluate their ability to hire in the US if they cannot operate within US legal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Religion
Asking about an applicant's religion, or if they have changed religions, is also illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Religion is a protected class, and employers cannot discriminate based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Height and Weight
While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight inquiries can be problematic. The EEOC states that such requirements tend to disproportionately limit employment opportunities for some protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Unless an employer can demonstrate a direct job-related necessity, these questions may be viewed as illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Some states and municipalities specifically prohibit discrimination based on height and weight unless it is an actual job requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Medical Conditions
Asking about medical conditions, medications, medical history, or upcoming surgeries is highly invasive and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Conclusion
This extreme example demonstrates the types of questions considered illegal under US anti-discrimination laws. Job seekers should keep their "radar up" for such inquiries during applications or interviews, as they indicate a potentially low-quality or scamming employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Identifying and avoiding these employers is crucial for a successful job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

A micromanager is a type of boss who is excessively involved in the minute details of their subordinates' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This boss type is one of the ten common "bad boss" types identified by a human resources and talent acquisition professional with over 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Micromanager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>
Micromanagers exhibit several distinct behaviors:
*   **Constant Oversight** They are usually "breathing down your neck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Involvement** They get involved in almost every aspect of your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Real-time Correction** They watch every step you make and may call out mistakes "almost seemingly in real time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Perfectionism** They are generally perfectionists who nitpick everything their subordinates do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Expectations** They hold employees to a "nearly impossible standard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

It can be baffling to observe a micromanager, as their intense involvement in their department's activities may lead one to wonder how they manage to complete their own responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

## Dealing with a Micromanager

If you find yourself working for a micromanager, it's important to develop a game plan for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. While encountering a bad boss doesn't necessarily mean you should immediately quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, it's crucial to acknowledge that a steady job is not an excuse to tolerate a [[handling_problematic_work_situations | bad work situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

As a recruiter and career coach, Brian from Life After Layoff emphasizes the [[importance_of_a_strong_resume | importance of a strong resume]] to secure job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there isn't one "right" way to write a resume, the ultimate test is whether it yields desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The advice shared comes from a [[effective_resume_writing_from_a_recruiters_perspective | corporate recruiter's perspective]] on how resumes are screened, often with only a 5-second glance, and feedback from hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The goal is to [[importance_of_a_strong_resume | improve your presentation]] and capture attention quickly to secure a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Avoid Outdated and Overly Designed Templates

A key piece of advice for [[using_templates_for_job_applications | using templates for job applications]] is to stop using outdated templates designed by graphic designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These templates are frequently seen on platforms like Canva.com and many "Big Industry resume hubs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

These templates often include:
*   Numerous graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   "Cute presentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

The primary reason to avoid these is that they tend to distract from the core purpose of a resume: quickly finding relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Recommended Template Characteristics

For most job seekers, a simple, clean approach is recommended:
*   **Simple Base** It is advised to use a very simple template, such as one downloaded from Microsoft Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Column Structure** Opt for a template that has a single column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Color Scheme** Avoid bright and flashy colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Stick to basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Generally, a resume should be "relatively boring" in its aesthetic presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For more on this, see [[effective_use_of_graphics_and_colors_in_resumes | Effective use of graphics and colors in resumes]].
*   **Fonts** Ensure that the fonts are clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Exception for Creative Fields

The only exception to the "boring" resume rule is if you are a graphic designer or work in a creative field where a more artistic approach to your resume might be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, even in this case, it's suggested that a graphic designer should not use a template designed by another graphic designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## ATS Compliance Considerations

Templates designed by graphic designers are often ineffective because their creators may not understand how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) work and how they parse resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This directly relates to [[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | Building an effective resume and ATS compliance]].

*   **Contact Information Layout** It is crucial to make your contact information vertical, not horizontal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. ATS systems typically do not read horizontal layouts well and struggle to parse the information correctly into fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **ATS Compliance Test** If you find that when applying for jobs, the ATS is not correctly parsing your name, phone number, or address, and you have to manually enter a lot of data, it's an indicator that your resume might not be [[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | ATS compliant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. While contact information isn't the primary reason for not being contacted, an ATS-compliant layout can speed up your applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

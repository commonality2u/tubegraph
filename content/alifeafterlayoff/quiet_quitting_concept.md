[[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | Quiet quitting]] is a new concept gaining traction in the workforce, seen as an extension of the [[great_resignation_extension | Great Resignation]] period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is a legitimate phenomenon currently happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?
[[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | Quiet quitting]] is defined as effectively quitting your job without actually quitting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This involves reducing your output to the minimum acceptable standard required for your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Employees do just enough to get by, avoiding extra tasks or burdens, thereby relieving themselves of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Rise of "Coasting Culture"
The author of a Business Insider article, highlighted in the discussion, describes a "coasting culture" where professionals are strategically dialing back their effort at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This shift occurred during the pandemic, when many began to view work simply as a means to a paycheck to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding their utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

The pandemic created ideal conditions for this new resolve:
*   **Hot Labor Market** A hot labor market ensured job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Remote Work** The rise of remote work made it harder for managers to monitor employee effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

People engaging in [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet quitting]] are making a deliberate decision to stop companies from squeezing "free labor" out of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. After years of feeling exploited through late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty, employees feel the tables have turned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This movement can be seen as a "secret resistance" against the status quo, indicating that the "hustle culture" is likely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Historical Context and Betrayal
Historically, the employment market pendulum swung heavily in favor of employers, who often treated employees as "resources to exploit" for maximum productivity at minimum cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This led to a "hustle culture" where employees felt compelled to work long hours, take on extra work, and remain constantly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Companies traditionally went through cycles of starting lean, bloating, and then cutting their workforce through layoffs during catastrophic events like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Leading up to 2020, companies had experienced an extended growth period, becoming bloated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. When the 2020 pandemic hit, it provided an "opportune time" for ruthless cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

These deep cuts, often made too aggressively, fractured the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. When demand "came screaming back" just months later, the remaining employees were left to pick up the slack, leading to burnout and a deep sense of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This period marks a "seismic shift" in the workplace, as employees re-evaluated the worth of their sacrifices and the "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Generational Shift
There is also a generational component to this shift. Baby Boomers are exiting the workforce, replaced by Gen Z, whose mentality about the workplace is "completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Companies are now forced to re-evaluate how they approach work and treat employees, as the days of 20-year company loyalty are "antiquated" and can even lead to falling behind on compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The pendulum has swung towards the employee, and many are now deciding they are no longer willing to work long hours or sacrifice weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. They are establishing employment boundaries, a healthy development that forces employers to improve how they treat their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Speaker's Stance and Alternatives
While acknowledging the phenomenon, the speaker does not advocate for [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet quitting]] as a solution to disliking a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Instead, he suggests treating oneself like a "free agent" and upgrading one's situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

However, for those who have built up equity, saved vacation time, or invested in a 401k, and feel that quitting is not the best immediate option, some are opting to reduce their work output to the minimum acceptable level to maintain their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This is partly because employers are often unable to backfill positions, and some output is considered better than none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Key takeaways from the article include:
*   Employees now view jobs as a source of a paycheck, not a "higher calling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   The mindset is shifting from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   Companies are no longer considered "family," and employees are shedding expectations that lead to grueling hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   After decades of "leaning in," many are now "leaning back" to avoid topping over from burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Instead of [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet quitting]], the speaker recommends:
*   Taking a serious look at one's work situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Keeping one's resume up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   Strategically planning one's exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Recruiters often receive a high volume of job applications, many of which are considered "total garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. When a recruiter publishes a job, hundreds of candidates may apply quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, but very few are well-qualified for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A vast majority of these inbound applications are a waste of time, as people tend to apply for jobs they are hopelessly underqualified for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Recruiters generally don't expect to hire someone based solely on an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>; they are usually actively seeking candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. It is estimated that only about five percent of inbound applications are qualified enough to excite a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Your First Impression

Your resume serves as your best, and often your only, first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Recruiters typically spend about five seconds assessing a resume to determine if it belongs in the "yes" or "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Once this initial impression is made, it is generally difficult to change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Revising an application after it has already been dispositioned will not change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to make your first impression count with a solid resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Standing Out from the Crowd

If you submit a good resume that is a close fit for the job, it comes as a "pleasant surprise" to the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A solid resume for a suitable job significantly increases your chances of getting noticed and cutting through the high volume of other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The goal is to create a resume that gives you the best chance of being noticed by a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

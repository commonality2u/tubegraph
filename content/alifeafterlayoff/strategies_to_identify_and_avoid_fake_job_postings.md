This article discusses the phenomenon of "ghost job postings," which are [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | job postings]] that employers have no real intention of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. These can be particularly frustrating for job seekers in a market that presents conflicting data, such as a high number of job openings alongside widespread layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

## Understanding Ghost Postings
A ghost posting is a job advertisement that an employer publishes without a genuine intent to hire for that specific role at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. A related concept is "pipelining wrecks" (requisitions), where employers post jobs primarily to collect resumes for potential future needs rather than immediate hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These practices are considered by some to offer a poor candidate experience, especially for individuals who are recently laid off and are earnestly seeking employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs
A survey by Clarify Capital, conducted between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, provides insights into why managers keep job postings active without immediate hiring intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>:

*   **Always open to new people (50%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>: Companies want to "window shop" for talent, keeping requisitions open to see who applies, even without an immediate need to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>: This reason is seen as "sinister," suggesting employers might mislead overworked employees into thinking help is coming when it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **To give the impression the company is growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>: This practice is viewed as deceitful to both job candidates and investors, potentially having legal implications from an SEC perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **The job was filled (or forgot to delete)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>: A filled position should be removed from job boards; keeping it active is considered a sign of a lazy recruiter or HR person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates in case of turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>: Similar to how job seekers should always keep their resumes updated, companies maintain candidate pipelines for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>: This reflects a passive approach to recruiting, where employers are not actively searching but open to exceptional, unsolicited applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   **No particular reason (they simply don't care)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>: Some employers keep listings open due to indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Survey Findings on Job Posting Duration
The Clarify Capital survey revealed:
*   68% of managers had job postings active for more than 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. While not shocking for highly skilled positions (average time to fill is 45-60 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, it hints at prolonged openings.
*   1 in 10 hiring managers had a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   1 in 5 managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (survey conducted in late 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

## [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | Identifying and Avoiding Ghost Postings]]
To avoid falling victim to ghost requisitions, job seekers should employ certain [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_navigate_the_job_market | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>:

1.  **Check the Posting Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>:
    *   If a job has been up for more than six months, it's likely a ghost wreck or the employer has no intention of filling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
    *   Similarly, if the same job is repeatedly posted over a long period, it's a strong indicator of a ghost wreck or an unstable hiring situation (e.g., high turnover or an indecisive hiring manager) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. These situations point to a [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | low quality employer]] or role that should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
    *   A job posted within the last week is more likely to be legitimate and actively recruited for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

2.  **Conduct Reverse Reference Checks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>:
    *   Investigate if the company recently had major layoffs, especially in the same types of positions they are now advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. If so, they might be building a pipeline for future hiring but have already demonstrated a lack of loyalty to those roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

3.  **Scrutinize the Job Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>:
    *   A job description with significant detail, specifying accomplishments, support structures, and clear responsibilities, indicates a more serious requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
    *   [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | Generic job descriptions]], which are often sales-focused on the company and lack specific role details, are a significant red flag and should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

By applying these [[effective_job_search_strategies | strategies]], job seekers can better discern legitimate opportunities and focus their efforts on high-quality roles with reputable employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

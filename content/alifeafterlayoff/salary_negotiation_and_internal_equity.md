Human Resources (HR) departments often employ strategies that aim to pay employees less than they might deserve, frequently citing internal policies and processes as justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## HR Tactics in Salary Discussions

HR departments typically aim to secure talent at the lowest possible cost, especially when job candidates are not adept at [[salary_negotiation_strategies | salary negotiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Rigid Salary Bands and Internal Equity
HR often attempts to fit candidates into narrow and inflexible salary bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. They commonly use "internal equity" as a reason to justify why a higher salary cannot be offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Promises of Future Raises or Revisions
A common tactic is to offer a lower-than-expected salary with a verbal promise to revisit or revise the salary after a few months or a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, many individuals have reported that these promises never materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

> [!warning] Unless it's explicitly included in the offer letter, employees should not expect verbal promises of future salary adjustments to be fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. It is difficult to prove such promises if they are not documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Salary Bands and Promotions
HR may also use salary bands as an excuse to deny appropriate raises or to provide "promotion in name only" without a corresponding increase in compensation, claiming the employee is already at the top end of their salary band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Exceptions to the Rule
Despite these common practices, HR departments are often capable of making exceptions and "moving mountains" when faced with:
*   A "rockstar" candidate who demands a higher-than-expected salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   A critical employee in a key role who tenders their resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

> [!tip] Understanding these dynamics highlights the importance of effective [[salary_negotiation_strategies | salary negotiation strategies]] and knowing how to navigate one's career with precision to reclaim control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The [[salary_expectations_and_negotiations | salary negotiation]] process effectively begins the moment a job application is submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

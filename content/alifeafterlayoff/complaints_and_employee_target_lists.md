When an employee raises concerns about a colleague, manager, or specific workplace conditions, Human Resources (HR) may unofficially add them to a "list" or negatively impact their reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## HR's Initial Response to Complaints
Upon receiving a complaint, HR's first action is often to consult with the complainant's direct manager or their manager's superior to discuss the employee and their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. HR will also typically review the employee's employment file to assess their history within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Risk of Being Deemed a "Troublemaker"
While lodging legitimate complaints is necessary, employees should exercise caution when approaching HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. A common outcome is that the complaining employee is perceived as the "troublemaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This aligns with HR's primary objective, which is to limit the company's liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## The "Root Problem" and Employee Separation
If complaints about an employer, boss, or other department members persist, HR will often try to resolve the situation by "separating" the involved parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. In this scenario, HR may work to eliminate what they identify as the "root problem," which frequently turns out to be the employee who initiated the complaint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This can be an [[indicators_of_being_pushed_out_at_work | indicator of being pushed out at work]], particularly if the complaints relate to a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic workplace environment]] or [[questions_indicating_a_toxic_workplace | other issues indicating a toxic workplace]].

When you're considering [[proper_etiquette_for_quitting_a_job | quitting your job]], it's essential to do so in the most [[proper_etiquette_for_quitting_a_job | proper]] and graceful way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. As a corporate recruiter and HR professional with over 20 years of experience, a strategic approach to leaving a position is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Why Leave Gracefully?

Whether you're leaving for a promotional opportunity, career advancement, or to escape a [[strategies_for_leaving_a_toxic_work_environment | bad situation]] or [[strategies_for_leaving_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic work environment]], the rules for leaving remain the same: you want to leave with grace and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

The wrong way to quit a job involves storming out, being destructive, or making a spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Such actions will likely result in you being ineligible for rehire, burning bridges, and potentially damaging your professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This negative impression can extend to former colleagues, making them hesitant to refer you for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Your "employment brand" is how you treat people when you leave an organization, and it will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Timing Your Departure

### Secure Your Next Opportunity First

If you're unsatisfied with your current job, boss, or situation, it is advised not to inform anyone until you are absolutely ready to move on and have secured another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Telling your boss too soon could lead to an earlier-than-anticipated departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. It's generally easier to find a new job when you're already employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Confirm All Pre-Employment Checks

Before giving your two weeks' notice, ensure all your "ducks are in a row" for the new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Drug screen results are back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   Background checks are complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   All references have been verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   You have a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

<div class="callout is-danger">
<h5>Warning</h5>
It is possible, though not common, for a job offer to be rescinded if issues arise during background checks or other pre-employment screenings *after* you've already given notice to your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Waiting for a "green light" from the new company shows professionalism and ensures your safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
</div>

### Keep It Confidential

Resist the temptation to share the news with work friends, even those you're close to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Keep your job search and new opportunity "tight-lipped" and discreet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. If rumors spread, it can "bite you" and potentially put you in a difficult position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Notifying Your Employer

### Who to Tell First

Once you have a confirmed start date for your new job, the next step is to set up a meeting with your current boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. It's crucial that your boss hears the news directly from you, not through the "grapevine" or rumor mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### How to Deliver the News

*   **Method:** Conduct this meeting face-to-face or via a Zoom call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Avoid sending an email or text message to deliver such important news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Composure:** Go into the meeting with "emotion zero point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Your decision should already be made, and there's no need for emotional outbursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### What to Say (and Not Say)

Keep your message short, sweet, and to the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **If leaving a [[strategies_for_leaving_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic situation]]:** "I just want to let you know that I've got another opportunity that came my way, and it's really the best move for my family. I just wanted to thank you for all the time, but I am giving my two weeks' notice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Do not elaborate on negative reasons for leaving, such as "you're a bad boss" or "I'm quitting because of this and this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This will only create a volatile situation with boiling emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Counter Offers:** Do not entertain [[strategies_for_job_resignation_and_counter_offers | counter offers]] at this point; your decision should be firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Professionalism:** Take the high road, be professional, and be courteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Thank them for their time and the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Communicating with Colleagues and Clients

### Seeking Approval to Announce

After informing your boss, ask for their opinion on when it's appropriate to inform your coworkers, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Wait for their "green light" to ensure you follow proper protocol and leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. This also allows you to collaboratively create a [[tips_for_transitioning_to_a_new_job | transition plan]] to smoothly hand off your responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### Consideration for Others

Remember that your departure will create a void of work, and your colleagues' workloads will likely increase temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. When speaking with them, use grace and appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. It's often not their fault if you're leaving a bad situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, so be considerate of those who will pick up the pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Building Your Professional Network

Directly contact individuals who were instrumental in your career (e.g., trainers, mentors, those who gave you opportunities) and give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Additionally, ask them to join your personal network, connecting on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. This builds powerful networks that can lead to future job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Two Weeks' Notice

You should absolutely give a two weeks' notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. While there's no strict requirement, it allows you to tie up loose ends and shows consideration for your colleagues and possibly your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. It's designed to avoid "screwing over" the people you worked with, who would otherwise have to scramble to cover your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

## Your Last Day and Beyond

On your last day, if possible, gather colleagues, especially those influential to you, for a quick huddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Share a high-level, generic [[reasons_for_leaving_a_job_and_how_to_discuss_them | reason for leaving]] (e.g., "better opportunity," "better for your family") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

*   **Keep it positive:** Focus on positive aspects like enjoying working with the team and the opportunity to grow your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid negativity:** Do not "trash" the company, the job, or your boss as you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain relationships:** Maintaining good working relationships keeps the door "cracked open" for future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. You never know if things might not work out at your new opportunity, or if former bosses might have new opportunities to offer later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   **References:** Always try to leave on good terms with former bosses, as you'll need them for references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

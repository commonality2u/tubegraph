The "Great Resignation" is a phenomenon where people are voluntarily leaving their jobs in large numbers, a trend that has gained momentum since the global events of the past 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This shift indicates widespread [[career_dissatisfaction_and_changes | career dissatisfaction]] among the workforce, leading many to seek new paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Scope of the Great Resignation

Research conducted by Microsoft revealed that up to 41% of currently employed individuals planned to leave their jobs within the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The U.S. Labor Department reported a record four million people quit their jobs voluntarily in April 2021, marking the beginning of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## [[reasons_for_employee_dissatisfaction | Reasons for Employee Dissatisfaction]]

Several factors contribute to this mass exodus:

### Re-evaluation of Priorities
Many individuals, having navigated the 2020-2021 lockdowns, began to perceive their lives and careers differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They reassessed the amount of time spent commuting and in traditional office settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

For example, one individual described a commute involving driving to a train station, a two-hour train ride, and a 20-minute walk, totaling four and a half to five hours of commuting daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This time was often spent performing tasks that could easily be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Remote Work and Flexibility
Historically, remote work carried a stigma, often seen as a sign of less dedication or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, the pandemic forced many companies with traditional work models to quickly adapt to remote operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This revealed that a significant number of professional "white-collar" jobs could be effectively performed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The unexpected shutdown of schools also necessitated flexible work arrangements for parents managing homeschooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Companies that were rigid and unaccommodating during this time contrasted sharply with those that offered flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Employees began to question the necessity of returning to traditional office settings after experiencing 18 months of remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Some companies, such as J.P. Morgan and other large banks, mandated a return to the office, which is seen by some as driven by "facetime" rather than valid business reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Additionally, policies that reduced salaries based on an employee's geographic location (e.g., moving from New York City to Iowa while performing the same job) were perceived as punitive, despite companies potentially saving on office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Increased Workload and [[career_dissatisfaction_and_job_burnout | Digital Burnout]]
Many companies overreacted at the start of the pandemic by implementing deeper-than-necessary layoffs, anticipating a greater impact on their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. When markets recovered faster than expected, the remaining employees absorbed the workload of their departed colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This led to overload and exhaustion, exacerbated by constant digital meetings and calls (e.g., Teams and Zoom), resulting in what is termed "digital burnout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Impact on the Job Market

The current labor market often favors employees, particularly at the hourly level, but also extends to professional roles, creating a "buyer's market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Companies that remain inflexible regarding [[employee_development_and_career_growth_opportunities | remote work]] and [[employee_development_and_career_growth_opportunities | work-life balance]] are likely to struggle in recruiting and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Remote work and flexibility are no longer competitive advantages but are becoming standard expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Concerns about flexibility and [[employee_development_and_career_growth_opportunities | work-life balance]] are increasingly prevalent among job candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Companies that refuse to adapt will face a competitive disadvantage in the recruitment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## The Importance of Employee Experience

Companies are now compelled to prioritize the "employment experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes the way people work and live, including productivity, flexibility, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. To remain competitive, companies must integrate these aspects into their benefit packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

Key components of a positive employment experience include:
*   Competitive financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
*   Meaningful [[employee_development_and_career_growth_opportunities | career paths]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
*   Sustainable [[employee_development_and_career_growth_opportunities | work-life balance]], avoiding excessive hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
*   Offering full-time employment over contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
*   Flexible work arrangements, such as remote or hybrid models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>

People are increasingly unwilling to remain in low-level, menial jobs that do not add value to their professional lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Many are choosing to make significant [[career_dissatisfaction_and_changes | career changes]], sometimes even complete 180-degree shifts, seeking faster advancement and rejecting outdated business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

This period, despite its challenges, is seen as beneficial because it is leading to a redefinition of workforce priorities, forcing companies to adapt to evolving employee needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

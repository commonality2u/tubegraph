Being [[do_not_hire_lists_and_blacklisting_in_companies | blacklisted]] by an employer, either formally or informally, is a real phenomenon that can prevent individuals from securing new employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Companies like Meta have confirmed they maintain block lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This article explores various ways employees can find themselves on such lists or encounter similar barriers to re-employment.

## Formal "Do Not Hire" Lists

Many companies, particularly in the tech sector, maintain internal lists that bar former employees from being rehired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Meta, for example, uses multiple systems to track rehire ineligibility, including a "non-regrettable attrition designation" and a "do not hire flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Most companies track this information in their HRIS (Human Resources Information System) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Discovery of Blacklisting

[[experiences_of_former_employees_being_blacklisted | Former Meta employees]] discovered they were on a block list after being laid off in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite being high-performing individuals laid off due to business decisions rather than performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, they consistently faced rejection when trying to rejoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The process often unfolds as follows:
*   **Hiring Manager Interest**: A hiring manager expresses interest in bringing the former employee back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Recruiter Ghosting**: Recruiters at the company then [[reasons_for_employment_ghosting | ghost them]] after an initial screening call is set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **HR Intervention**: The hiring manager is later informed by the recruiting team that they are "ineligible for rehire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Disclosure**: Often, individuals learn of their blacklisting through a third-party headhunting agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. After the agency submits the candidate's application, the company informs them that the individual is on a [[do_not_hire_lists_and_blacklisting_in_companies | do not hire list]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Reasons for Inclusion on a Blacklist

While companies claim clear criteria for being marked ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, the reasons can be ambiguous.

Common reasons include:
*   **Violating Workplace Policies**: Engaging in actions like stealing confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Underperformance**: Consistent poor performance can lead to blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Manager Discretion**: In some cases, managers have broad discretion to add names to the list without documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. If a manager "didn't like you," it was not hard to put someone on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Reason for Separation**: If an employee quits abruptly without notice (e.g., "rage quitting"), they are likely to be permanently banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Policy Violation/Termination**: This includes performance terminations, involuntary resignations, or even voluntary separations depending on the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Performance Signals**: Last ratings prior to separation and any other performance signals can contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Informal Blacklisting Through Application Activity

Even if an individual has no prior employment history with a company, they can still face an informal form of blacklisting. This occurs when a candidate applies for numerous jobs at the same company over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

*   **Bias Against High Volume Applications**: Staffing teams and hiring managers may develop a bias against candidates with 30 or 40 different applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. They might question why other teams haven't hired the individual if they've applied so many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Interview History**: Companies like Amazon track interview processes, assigning a "disposition status" and a "recycle period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   If a candidate failed a technical screen, they might be able to reapply after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   However, if removed due to failing "leadership principles" (behavior-based interviews), there was often no recycling period, effectively banning them permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Spamming Applications**: Applying for every single job on an applicant tracking system, especially for unrelated positions, can make an applicant appear "spammy" and lead to an informal blacklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Backdoor References

A "backdoor reference" is another way an individual can be effectively [[do_not_hire_lists_and_blacklisting_in_companies | blacklisted]] from opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This occurs when someone on a hiring team contacts a former colleague or acquaintance of the candidate at a previous company to informally inquire about their performance or character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Negative opinions from these unofficial references can sink a candidate's chances and potentially lead to them being [[do_not_hire_lists_and_blacklisting_in_companies | blacklisted]] altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This practice is often invisible to the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

While some employers actively use [[do_not_hire_lists_and_blacklisting_in_companies | do not hire lists]], this practice is not believed to be widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The world is full of other employers, and candidates should focus on reclaiming control over their careers rather than dwelling on the policies of a single company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

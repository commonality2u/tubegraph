## What Not to Share with Coworkers
Sharing certain information with coworkers can lead to negative consequences, potentially jeopardizing one's job or career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. A former HR professional has compiled a list of common disclosures that have caused trouble in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Why Not to Share Your Salary Internally
While acknowledging that [[salary_transparency_and_self_reported_salaries | Salary Transparency]] at the highest level is beneficial for creating a level playing field, it is advised against sharing your specific salary within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:04">[03:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:01">[03:17:01]</a>.

The reasons for this caution include:
*   **Underpaid Colleagues** Once salaries are shared, it's inevitable that some coworkers will realize they are underpaid, leading to upset reactions and potential demands for fair compensation or even quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Trust** Management may perceive salary sharing as a breach of trust, regardless of legitimate reasons for pay differences such as skill, experience, or changes in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Promotion** If a boss loses trust in an employee due to salary discussions, it can hinder future promotion opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### How to Share Salary Information Safely
If you wish to contribute to [[salary_transparency_and_self_reported_salaries | Salary Transparency]], the recommended method is to share your salary anonymously on external platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:01">[04:01:01]</a>.

Suggested platforms include:
*   Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>
*   Comparably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>
*   Team Blind (especially for those in the tech industry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>

Sharing salary information anonymously in these settings allows others to understand fair compensation for specific roles without personal blowback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Job Search and Offer Negotiation
When seeking new employment, it is crucial to market oneself effectively through the interview process, from the initial job search to receiving an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. The goal is to ensure that you "don't leave a dime on the table" when it comes to the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

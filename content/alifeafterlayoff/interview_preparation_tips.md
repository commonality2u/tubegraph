*   **Prepare and Practice**: [[preparing_for_interviews_with_targeted_responses | Prepare your answers]] thoroughly, practice delivering them clearly and comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Show Value**: Focus on demonstrating your value to the prospective employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Be Confident**: Recognize that you were called for an interview because something on your resume intrigued them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Common Trap Interview Questions and How to Answer Them

### "Why did you leave your last job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

This question tests your professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Negative answers, such as badmouthing a former employer or revealing a history of job hopping with little notice, can make you look bad or suggest poor decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategy
> *   **Stay Positive**: Avoid bashing your former employer or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
> *   **Less is More**: Don't spill too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
> *   **Focus on Growth**: Emphasize what you gained or what you're seeking, such as a role to grow specific skills like leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
> *   **If laid off**: Briefly mention it, but quickly pivot to why you're excited about the current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
> *   **Keep it Classy**: Focus on why you are a great fit for *this* role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### "What's your biggest weakness?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

This classic trap question assesses self-awareness and how your weakness aligns with the job or organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, stating you're not detail-oriented for a precision-required job makes you a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategy
> *   **Be Self-Aware**: Understand the job's competencies and avoid naming one of them as a weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
> *   **Avoid Arrogance**: Never say you have no weaknesses; it comes across as insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
> *   **No Cliches**: Don't use overly cliche answers like "I work too hard" or "I care too much," as employers see them as cop-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
> *   **Pick a Real, Non-Deal-Breaker Weakness**: Choose a genuine weakness that isn't critical for the job type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
> *   **Check Company Values**: Research the company's core values before the interview to avoid providing an answer that goes against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
> *   **Show Growth**: After sharing a relatively safe example, explain how you've addressed or improved upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. For example, if you struggled with delegating tasks, explain how you learned to trust your team and distribute workload effectively, boosting productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### "Where do you see yourself in five years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

This is a trap because if your stated goals don't align with the hiring manager's expectations for the role's growth, you'll likely be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Stating you want to start a business might make you seem uncommitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.Conversely, stating you want the interviewer's job can be offensive, and having no plan makes you look lost or unmotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategy
> *   **Align with Company Goals**: Tie your aspirations to the company's and the specific job's goals, ensuring they are in alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
> *   **Show Ambition and Long-term Commitment**: Express a desire to master the current role, exceed expectations, and potentially move onto a leadership career path while helping the company achieve its goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
> *   **Be Honest**: Don't provide a dishonest answer if you're not genuinely interested in the path they expect, as it can lead to a career mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
> *   **Don't Wing It**: This question requires forethought and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### "Tell me about a time when you failed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>

This is a setup to see how you handle failure and setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Blaming others or picking a massive failure (e.g., costing the company a million dollars) can make you appear unreliable or incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, leading to defensive follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategy
> *   **Choose a Small Failure**: Select a relatively minor failure without huge stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
> *   **Own It**: Take responsibility for the failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
> *   **Show Improvement and Growth**: Explain what you learned from the experience and how you've applied that learning to grow stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### "What's your current salary?" or "What are your salary expectations?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

Sharing your current salary can lead to a lowball offer or leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. A high expectation might scare them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. While some states ban asking about current salary, it still comes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Avoiding the question completely might lead to rejection or limbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, as companies don't want to waste time if salary expectations are too far apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategy
> *   **Deflect Current Salary**: If asked about current salary, try to deflect and focus on the role's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
> *   **Ask Them First (for expectations)**: When asked about salary expectations, strategically ask them to share their range first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
> *   **Provide a Range (if they don't)**: If they press you, provide a range based on your "minimum acceptable salary" plus 10-20% above that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
> *   **Do Salary Research**: Conduct thorough salary research beforehand and be realistic about your skills and what you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
> *   **Control Your Worth**: Do not allow the company to determine your salary; you should control that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### "What do you know about our job/company?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>

Often mistaken as an icebreaker, this is an actual interview question that traps those who haven't done their homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Not knowing about the role or company makes you appear lazy or uninvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategy
> *   **Research Thoroughly**: Research the company's mission and understand the role's responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
> *   **Show Genuine Interest**: Demonstrate genuine interest, especially with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
> *   **Articulate Understanding**: Explain what you know about the company's goals, recent products, and how the role supports specific divisions and responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
> *   **Ask Clarifying Questions**: State your understanding and then invite them to elaborate on anything you might be missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
> *   **Express Excitement**: Conclude by expressing genuine excitement for the position and its reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
> *   **Formulate Questions**: Asking timely questions can help establish a dominant frame in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### "Why do you want to work here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>

While the honest answer might be "I need a job," this won't land you an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. They want to know you're not just seeking a paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. As the "seller" of your candidacy to the "buyer" (the employer), you need to make it about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategy
> *   **Make it About Them**: Swallow your pride and focus on how you can meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
> *   **Solve Their Problem**: Tie your answer to what they're trying to solve with the job, positioning yourself as the best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
> *   **Show Passion and Alignment**: Express admiration for their company values, products, or services, and explain why you'd be a great fit due to specific skills or experiences (X, Y, and Z) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

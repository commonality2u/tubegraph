The question "Where do you see yourself in five years?" is a common interview trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Its purpose is to assess your [[career_plans_and_their_impact_on_interviews | career plans]] and their alignment with the company's expectations for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Why It's a Trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

This question can be a trap for several reasons:

*   **Misalignment with Role Expectations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>: If your stated goals do not match the hiring manager's expectations for the role's growth trajectory, you may be seen as a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. For example, if the role is part of a succession management plan and you express a desire to start your own business soon, they will likely perceive a lack of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This indicates you might not meet their long-term expectations for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Appearing Overly Ambitious** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>: Stating you're "here to take your job" can offend the hiring manager and make you seem "too big for your britches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Appearing Unmotivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>: Having no plan at all can make you appear lost or unmotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## How to Answer Effectively

The key is to tie your goals to those of the company and the specific job you're applying for, ensuring they are in alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

*   **Show Ambition and Long-Term Commitment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:
    > "Ideally, I will have learned this job completely and be exceeding my expectations. In five years, hopefully, I will be on a leadership career path while continuing to help the company's goals, but at the same time building my leadership competency." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
    This type of answer demonstrates ambition and suggests you are interested in a long-term commitment to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

*   **Be Honest and Self-Aware** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>:
    [!WARNING] Don't just feed them a line of BS. If you're genuinely not interested in leadership, and that's what they expect for the role, you might find yourself in a career mismatch that won't end well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Be honest about your aspirations and ensure there's good alignment with the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

This is a question you should prepare for and not "wing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

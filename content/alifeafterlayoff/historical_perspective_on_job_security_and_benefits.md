The modern workplace is experiencing a significant shift, prompting a reevaluation of traditional career approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The labor market is currently volatile, with numerous stories of employees being treated poorly during "reductions in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This represents another seismic shift in the employment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Generational Changes in Employment Norms

### Grandfather's Generation (Pre-Baby Boomers)

In the generation before the Baby Boomers, individuals typically obtained an education or learned a skill/trade, then worked for a single employer for up to 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. They collected a paycheck and enjoyed a pension upon [[changes_in_retirement_and_benefits_plans | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Employers viewed employees as assets throughout their entire life cycle, and the concept of [[employer_perspectives_on_job_hopping | job hopping]] was almost unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, the speaker's grandfather worked in a steel mill for his entire career, moving into different roles but remaining with the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Baby Boomer Generation

Many of these values continued into the Baby Boomer generation, with a high degree of corporate loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Employees invested themselves in a company and career path, sticking with it through good and bad times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This often included difficult decisions, such as relocating if a plant closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While layoffs and market fluctuations occurred, they were not as common as they are today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. It was still possible to work for one or two employers throughout a career and receive a pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Erosion of Employer-Employee Loyalty

### Shift from Pensions to 401ks

One of the first signs of employers decoupling loyalty was the widespread elimination of pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Pensions were entirely employer-funded, whereas the shift to 401ks meant employees contributed, with employers offering only a small matching percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This change allowed corporations to share costs and maximize profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This marked a clear break in the implied agreement where employers would "take care of" employees for their entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Weakening Medical Benefits

Following the shift in [[changes_in_retirement_and_benefits_plans | retirement]] plans, companies also began to increase employee contributions to medical premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It is now rare for companies to pay 100% of medical insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Many plans today have high deductibles (e.g., $6,000-$7,000) and significant monthly employee payments (e.g., $600 for a family), placing a heavy burden on workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This further illustrates corporations reducing their loyalty, while employees often maintain fierce loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Loss of Job Security

The most recent and significant change is the erosion of [[challenges_of_job_security_in_modern_employment | job security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Historically, corporations might reduce other expenses during tough patches but generally avoided large-scale layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Today, companies quickly resort to mass layoffs at the first sign of an issue, often to "right-size" their business for corporate profitability and shareholder value, rather than due to actual financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The mutually loyal relationship between employee and employer has been "completely wiped out," with the absence of pensions, strong medical benefits, and [[challenges_of_job_security_in_modern_employment | job security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The brazen methods of laying people off further demonstrate that corporate loyalty, from the employer's side, is "completely dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## The Modern Labor Market and its Consequences

Leading up to the pandemic, the economy was already rocky, and the shutdown led companies to quickly lay people off, often after denying such plans just weeks before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. When the economy rebounded, employers "greedily" ramped up hiring, competing for talent and driving up salaries, especially for roles like software developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. However, at the first sign of new trouble, these companies collectively began cutting staff, often to improve shareholder statistics rather than due to financial distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

This behavior highlights an "unhealthy" relationship between companies and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Movements like the "Great Resignation" and "Quiet Quitting" are seen as symptoms of a deeper "disease" within careers and employment across nearly all industries and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Examples of Employer Behavior

*   **Pipelining Requisitions**: Some major tech employers lay off staff and, in the same week, post "pipelining requisitions" â€“ job listings with no intention of immediate hiring, simply to collect applications for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. This demonstrates poor optics and a lack of consideration for candidates, especially those recently laid off by the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Reality

The workplace has been fractured, particularly over the last three years, and further layoffs are expected to continue this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Employees must learn to act like "free agents" and prioritize self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. This includes:

*   **Diversifying Income Streams**: Starting side hustles and not relying solely on a single employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Being Prepared**: Recognizing that layoffs can affect anyone, even top performers, without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
*   **Questioning Employers**: During interviews, ask difficult questions about the company's business, plans, and past performance regarding layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. A company's past behavior is the best indicator of its future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

The idea of a long-term career within a single organization is largely no longer a reality for the vast majority of average workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Companies often treat people as commodities, cutting them when they are no longer deemed useful, with no accountability for this repeating cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to go into employment situations with "eyes wide open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

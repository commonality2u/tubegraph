When crafting a resume, it's important to be strategic about what information to include regarding your work history and educational background. This ensures the document remains clean, concise, and focused on what is most relevant to potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A well-crafted resume is critically important, especially in a tight labor market, as it forms the first impression on recruiters and hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If you are applying to jobs but not receiving responses, it's often an issue with the resume itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, highlighting the [[optimizing_and_customizing_your_resume | importance of optimizing and customizing your resume]] for recruitment teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Work History

The general guideline is to focus on your most recent and relevant work experience.

### What to Include

*   **Recent History:** Employers typically focus on the last 10 years of your work history, and often even more recently, such as the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Relevance:** Skills gained more than 10 years ago may no longer be relevant due to market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### What to Avoid

*   **Excessive History:** Unless a job specifically requires 20 years of experience, such as a senior executive position, there's no need to include a long, elaborate work history that goes back more than 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Industry-Specific Jargon or Acronyms:** Do not include industry-specific jargon or acronyms in job titles or descriptions if they would not be understood outside of your previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This is because recruiters and other hiring managers might not understand them, which hinders your discoverability and makes it harder for them to assess your qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The goal is to make your resume as clear as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Educational Details

Be selective and concise when detailing your education.

### What to Include

*   **Concise School Names:** You don't need to provide excessive detail about your degrees or the specific schools within a university. For instance, just stating "Penn State" is sufficient, rather than "Schmiel School of Business at Penn State" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Include the degree type obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Minor Degrees (Judiciously):** Minor degrees can serve as useful keywords, but employers generally don't weigh them heavily. Avoid dedicating significant space to listing all the courses studied for a minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   **Exception for Entry-Level:** If you are entry-level, including more detail about courses might be beneficial to showcase a better fit for a first job out of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **GPA (Early Career Only):** If you are entry-level or have less than three years of total work experience, you should include your GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Plan to remove it once you exceed that experience threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### What to Avoid

*   **GPA (Mid-Career and Beyond):** If you are more than three years out of college, do not include your GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Employers typically do not care about it or ask about it at that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Internships (Mid-Career and Beyond):** If you have been in the workforce for longer than three years, remove internships from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Internships are not usually counted as total years of experience and can be perceived as "vanity stats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can create a more effective resume that highlights your most relevant qualifications and increases your chances of getting noticed by recruiters.

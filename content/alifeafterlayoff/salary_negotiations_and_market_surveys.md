The process of receiving a job offer involves several internal company procedures, especially concerning compensation, which is often influenced by [[understanding_salary_bands_and_market_wage_surveys | market wage surveys]] and [[Salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | salary expectations]]. Brian, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, demystifies the behind-the-scenes workings of talent acquisition and human resources departments with regard to offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Offer Formulation Process

After a debrief meeting where all interviewing stakeholders provide a near-unanimous consensus to move forward, the Human Resources (HR) or Talent Acquisition group begins to pull together offer details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This process involves several key considerations:

### Determining Offer Details

Companies, particularly large ones, use multiple data points to formulate a compensation offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>:

*   **Candidate's Compensation Expectation** The initial notes from the preliminary interview with the recruiter regarding the candidate's stated [[Salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | compensation expectation]] are reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Local Market Wage Surveys / Data** The HR team assesses [[understanding_salary_bands_and_market_wage_surveys | local market wage surveys]] or wage data to understand what the industry is currently paying for similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Salary Bands** Companies refer to their internal [[understanding_salary_bands_and_market_wage_surveys | salary bands]], which typically include a minimum, mid-point, and maximum (or 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Most companies aim to keep candidates at or below the 50th percentile to maintain [[Salary Negotiation and Internal Equity | internal equity]] and allow for future merit increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. If a candidate comes in at the top end of the range, they may not receive raises for a few years, which can lead to retention issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Internal Comparators** The compensation team also examines the salaries of other employees in similar roles within the organization to ensure [[Salary Negotiation and Internal Equity | internal equity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Strategic Decisions for High Expectations

If a candidate's [[Salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | salary expectation]] is significantly higher than the average for that role, the company must make strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, candidates sometimes have expectations $20,000-$30,000 higher than the rest of the group, even with less experience or skill, which can cause internal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. In such cases, HR and the hiring manager collaborate to determine a compelling offer that doesn't disrupt the existing salary structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

If a candidate's salary expectation significantly stretches the existing salary band, the HR department and hiring manager may consider "enriching" the role to justify the higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. It's important for candidates to target properly scoped roles for their experience level, as accepting a role that requires stretching the salary band means the company will likely expect more from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Offer Approval and Presentation

Once a proposed offer is formulated, it goes through an approval process, typically involving three or four layers of management, including the hiring manager, their boss, and an HR business partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. After all approvals are secured, the recruiter creates the offer letter and contacts the candidate to present the offer and begin the [[Salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | negotiation process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This [[Salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | negotiation process]], even if smooth, generally takes at least a week or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Recruiter's Role in Negotiations

A corporate recruiter's role includes advocating for the candidate to ensure the proposed offer is likely to result in a successful hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Recruiters want to fill positions efficiently and generally do not enjoy prolonged offer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Tips for Candidates

If you are waiting for an offer that seems to be taking a long time, it is advisable to gently nudge the hiring team, particularly the recruiter, to check on the status and inquire about a timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Checking in every two or three days is acceptable, as recruiters often have a sense of urgency to finalize offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Staying with the same employer for an extended period, particularly more than two years, can lead to significant wage stagnation, even if you are satisfied with your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This phenomenon can cause the market to pass you by, impacting both career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Problem: Market Rate Discrepancy

Individuals who remain in a job for too long often find that the market begins to surpass their current compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This happens because companies continually hire new talent from outside the market at higher rates, often offering 10%, 15%, or even 20% raises for those [[wage_growth_trends_for_job_switchers_vs_stayers | jumping from job to job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Conversely, internal employees typically receive smaller annual raises, such as 1-3% for cost-of-living adjustments, or promotional bumps of 5-10% every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

This disparity means that someone with five or more years of experience might find a brand-new, inexperienced colleague making the same or even more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Additionally, in periods of high inflation, small raises can result in employees effectively earning less money for the same work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Anecdotal Evidence

A person who had spent seven to eight years with a single employer, despite being a top performer and having received promotions, found themselves significantly underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. After nearly 100% turnover in their department in 18 months, and in a high-demand medical field where finding new positions was relatively easy, they were recruited and secured an offer for $5 more per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. When they informed their current employer of their intent to leave, the employer countered with a $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This substantial counter-offer highlighted that the individual was likely drastically underpaid to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Employer Pay Philosophies

Companies typically adopt one of two pay philosophies:
*   **Pay Leaders:** These companies aim to retain talent by paying competitively and can poach talent from other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggers:** These companies may not prioritize retaining employees through competitive pay, with turnover being a built-in part of their model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

While some companies may intentionally underpay, others might simply not adjust salaries for long-term employees unless prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Recruiters often observe that internal departments can be 20-30% below market rate, a fact that is sometimes flagged to HR but not always adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

However, high turnover can become more expensive for companies due to recruiting and training costs, and the loss of "tribal knowledge" and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The Solution: Regularly Test the Market

To counteract [[the_drawbacks_of_a_steady_job_for_career_growth | wage stagnation]] and ensure fair compensation, it is crucial to act like the CEO of your career and keep tabs on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Recommended Strategy

Even if you are satisfied in your current role, you should, at a minimum, test the open market every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This involves:
*   Submitting applications for jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Networking with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Going through interview processes to understand current skill demands and assessment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The goal is to determine if you are underpaid relative to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. If you consistently stay in a role for a long period, the market will inevitably pass you by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Failing to keep up can make it impossible to catch up unless your company performs a major salary adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Leveraging Offers Carefully

While it's important to understand your market value, it's advised to be selective when using external offers to negotiate with your current employer, as companies might eventually call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. However, a significant counter-offer can indicate that you were underpaid from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

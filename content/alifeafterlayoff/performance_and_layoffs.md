Being caught in a layoff can be a significant ego hit, leading individuals to second-guess themselves and question why they were selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The typical scenario involves an unexpected meeting notice, followed by an HR person presenting severance terms and informing the employee their position was affected by a reduction in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While the company assures the employee it's not their fault, a common immediate conclusion drawn by others is that it was [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | performance-related]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, in many cases, it is actually not the employee's fault, and most reasons for layoffs have nothing to do with individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## How Performance is Assessed in Layoffs

When [[Handling of layoffs by companies | companies]] consider [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | performance]] as a factor in layoffs, they typically evaluate an individual's performance against their team, department, or similar departments across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Key indicators often include:
*   **Measurable Output** Companies look at overall performance or output that is measurable, such as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or visible tracking boards in team rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. These indicators can suggest whether an employee would be on a layoff list if the company downsizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. If an employee notices their performance tracking below teammates, it might be a warning sign to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Performance Appraisal Ratings** Companies frequently pull performance appraisal data and identify the lowest performers on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Nine-Box Method** Managers may be asked to rank employees using a nine-box grid. Those falling into the bottom quadrants are typically candidates for layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Realistically, individuals at the lower end of the [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | performance]] spectrum are often the first to be impacted in layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Performance vs. Other Factors

While [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | performance]] can be a factor, being laid off does not automatically mean an employee was a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. In fact, most layoff reasons are not directly tied to performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Other contributing factors can include:
*   **[[seniority_and_impact_on_layoffs | Seniority]]** Companies often lay off newer tenured employees (last in, first out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, even with [[seniority_and_impact_on_layoffs | seniority]], lower performance can still lead to being laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **[[role_redundancy_and_obsolete_skills_leading_to_layoffs | Skills Obsolescence or Role Redundancy]]** If an employee's skills become obsolete or their role is no longer needed, they may be laid off, even if their performance was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This is distinct from a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **[[departmental_shifts_and_strategic_direction_in_layoffs | Departmental Need and Strategic Direction]]** Layoffs can occur due to a change in departmental focus or a deemphasis on certain products or groups, irrespective of individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Top performers can be caught in these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Cost-Cutting Measures** Employees in experimental divisions or those not generating revenue may be targeted during cost-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Senior employees with high salaries and atrophied skills who haven't kept pace with the market might be laid off to be replaced by cheaper alternatives, as payroll is a major company expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Voluntary Severance Programs** Companies may offer voluntary severance packages (e.g., early retirement) hoping a percentage of the workforce will accept, thus reducing the need for involuntary layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Legal and Ethical Considerations** While often discreet, factors like age-based discrimination or other protected classes (gender, creed, color) can sometimes play an [[Human Resource Practices in layoffs | unscrupulous role]] in layoff decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Reclaiming Control After a Layoff

Given that [[Corporate layoffs and employee treatment | companies]] can make layoff decisions for various reasons, including at-will employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, it is in an employee's best interest to act as the CEO of their own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This involves:
*   **Skill Development** Building in-demand skill sets relevant to the broader market, not just the current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Resume Maintenance** Keeping one's resume updated and considering other opportunities aligning with long-term career vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Networking** Actively networking within the industry, including with competitors, to stay connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Multiple Income Streams** Developing multiple streams of income to reduce complete dependence on a single employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Being laid off does not mean an individual is "damaged goods" or automatically indicates a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

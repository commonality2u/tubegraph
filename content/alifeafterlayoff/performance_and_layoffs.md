When individuals are [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | laid off]], it can feel like a significant [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | ego hit]], leading to second-guessing and wondering why they were chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, in many cases, being laid off is not due to an individual's fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Most reasons for layoffs have nothing to do with performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### How Companies Decide on Layoffs

Companies employ various criteria to determine which employees are selected for the [[layoff_processes_and_communication | layoff list]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A common scenario involves receiving an unusual meeting notice, followed by an HR discussion about severance terms and being informed that one's position has been affected by a reduction in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Performance as a Factor in Layoffs

One of the reasons companies consider for layoffs is an employee's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This often occurs when an individual's performance is measurably lower than that of their team, department, or others in similar roles across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Companies typically assess:
*   **Overall Performance/Output** Companies look at measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or visible performance tracking boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. If an employee's output is consistently below that of their teammates, it could be a warning sign to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Performance Appraisals** Data from performance appraisals is often pulled, and the lowest performers may be identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Nine-Box Ranking** Managers may be asked to rank employees using a "nine-box" grid, and those falling into the bottom quadrants are typically candidates for layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

While it is unfortunate, employees on the lower end of the performance spectrum are often the first to be affected during [[impact_of_layoffs_and_poor_company_practices | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, it's crucial to remember that being laid off does not automatically imply a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Other Reasons for Layoffs

Beyond performance, several other factors influence layoff decisions:

*   **[[seniority_in_company_layoffs | Seniority]]** Companies often employ a "last in, first out" mentality, targeting newer employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This presents a risk when leaving a long-term position for a new job, as one might become the "low person on the totem pole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **[[skills_and_role_relevance_affecting_layoffs | Skills and Role Relevance]]** Layoffs can occur if an employee's skills become obsolete or if their role is no longer needed due to organizational evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This is distinct from a performance issue; it's about the company's changing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Adapting to market trends, acquiring new technical skills, and staying current with industry demands are crucial for job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The rise of AI, for example, accelerates the need for adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **[[departmental_needs_and_strategic_direction_in_layoffs | Departmental Need and Strategic Direction]]** A common reason for layoffs, especially in the tech sector, is a shift in departmental focus or a deemphasis on certain products or groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This is tied to the strategic direction of the organization, not individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Even top performers or recently promoted individuals can be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. To mitigate this risk, one might avoid joining experimental projects or divisions not central to the core business or not generating significant revenue, especially during economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Cost-Cutting Measures** Employees in experimental or non-revenue-generating divisions are often targeted in cost-cutting measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Companies may also scrutinize high-earners, comparing their salary to their output or current skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Seniors in their careers might be targeted if their skills have atrophied but they maintain a high salary, making them replaceable with cheaper alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Payroll is a significant company expense, heavily scrutinized during economic uncertainty and with disruptive technologies like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Voluntary Severance Programs** Companies may offer voluntary severance packages, often lucrative, to encourage early retirement or voluntary departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. If enough employees accept, it can reduce the need for forced layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Legal and Ethical Considerations** While often hidden, legal and ethical considerations, such as age-based discrimination or targeting protected classes (gender, creed, color), can influence layoff decisions, especially with unscrupulous companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Reclaiming Control After a Layoff

Given that companies can make layoff decisions, often with "at will" employment, it is in an individual's best interest to reclaim control of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This involves:
*   **Skill Development** Building in-demand skill sets aligned with the broader market, not just the current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Resume Maintenance** Keeping a resume up-to-date and actively considering other opportunities that align with long-term career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Networking** Engaging in targeted networking, especially with competitors, to stay well-connected in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Targeted networking can be more critical than a resume for landing job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Multiple Streams of Income** Developing multiple income streams reduces dependence on a single employer, fostering greater control over one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Career Strategy** Developing an overarching career strategy is crucial for setting a foundation for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

Being laid off does not mean one is "damaged goods" or automatically a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Understanding their characteristics can help you determine if your current work environment is sustainable or if it's time to consider a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Angry Boss

Every organization often has at least one "hot head" who is easily identifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Characteristics
*   **Volatile Temperament**: You can frequently hear them screaming from their office or making a big commotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Intimidation**: They tend to "fly off the handlebars" at a moment's notice, causing everyone in the department to walk on eggshells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. They rule by intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Lack of Emotional Intelligence**: Despite their behavior, these types of bosses often reach leadership positions even though they lack emotional intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Belittling**: They may scream, yell, and belittle employees in front of coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Impact and Recommendations
Working for an angry boss offers almost no upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. If you find yourself in this situation, it is strongly suggested to update your resume and exit the [[navigating_toxic_work_environments | toxic situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## The Micromanaging Boss

The micromanaging boss is characterized by an excessive involvement in their subordinates' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Characteristics
*   **Overly Involved**: They breathe down your neck and are "too in the weeds," getting involved in almost every aspect of your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Constant Scrutiny**: They watch every step you make and call out mistakes seemingly in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Perfectionism**: Micromanagers are generally perfectionists who nitpick everything you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Standards**: They hold employees to a nearly impossible standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Impact
Working for a micromanager can make you wonder how they manage to get their own job done, given their deep involvement in everyone else's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## General Considerations

Encountering a [[types_of_bad_bosses_in_the_workplace | bad boss]], whether angry or micromanaging, doesn't always mean you should immediately quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, it is essential to develop a game plan for [[handling_difficult_relationships_with_bosses | handling your career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

It's a common misconception that putting in excessive hours and hard work automatically leads to promotions and career progression. However, personal experience and observations suggest that this is often not the case; instead, working smart is the key to advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Hard Work Doesn't Always Lead to Promotions

The speaker shares a personal anecdote about working 12+ hour days, sometimes coming in on Saturdays, feeling pressure from a "workaholic boss" to keep pace and get recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Despite these [[worklife_balance_and_excessive_working_hours | excessive working hours]] and efforts to impress, a promotion never materialized, and the plant eventually shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This experience taught the speaker that it's "not the person who works the most hours that gets promoted; it's the person who works the smartest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Working Smart

Working smart involves a strategic approach to your career, focusing on visibility, relevance, and self-advocacy.

### Focus on Visible Projects

The smartest way to work is to focus on projects that your boss and your boss's boss care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. If you're working on tasks you believe are impressive but aren't priorities for senior leadership, your name likely won't come up in promotion discussions in the way you hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Highly visible projects are what truly lead to promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### Advocate for Yourself

It's crucial to let people know about your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. You have a choice: learn "the rules of the game" and participate, or remain on the sidelines and watch others get promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Part of this game is advocating for yourself to the right people, who are often not just your direct boss, but your boss's boss, as they are typically the ones making promotion decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. No one else in the organization will advocate for you to the same extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

### Be the CEO of Your Career

To progress, you must [[the_importance_of_being_a_proactive_career_planner | act like the CEO of your career]] and wear multiple hats, including being your own marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This means proactively putting together campaigns to highlight your effectiveness within the company, your department, and your role, as well as on the open market during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. If you're content with your current level, this approach may not apply, but for those aiming for advancement, it's essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

### Prioritize Relevant Skills

While being excellent at a specific thing can be a competitive advantage, relevant skills are more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Employers value certain skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. If your skills become irrelevant, you might find yourself with a resume full of abilities "nobody cares about anymore," leading to panic and settling for lower-quality jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. The key is to focus on developing relevant skills that are highly in demand by multiple employers, not just your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

### Understand the "What Have You Done for Me Lately?" Mentality

Goodwill built up from past achievements is typically very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Senior leaders are primarily concerned with what you can produce tomorrow, not necessarily what you did yesterday or are producing today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. If they don't believe you can contribute in the future or don't have plans for your skills, you might find yourself in a vulnerable position, such as on a layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

This "cold and cutthroat" reality emphasizes the need to act as a "free agent" in your career, always looking out for yourself first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. It's not "a dirty word" to [[being_selfish_in_your_career | put yourself first]] and your employer second, as long as you do it smartly and develop the necessary skills to be the CEO of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

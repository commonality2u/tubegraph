Quitting your job might not be the best decision at present, largely due to the [[current_job_market_challenges | current job market]] conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While many seek career coaching for issues like a problematic boss, lack of respect, toxic situations, or feeling underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, a corporate recruiter suggests that quitting is often not in their best interest, especially given today's job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Current Job Market Overview

The [[current_job_market_challenges | job market]] is currently not very favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Many who have quit their jobs are finding it extremely difficult and slow to find new employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Even marketable individuals with strong backgrounds are struggling to get calls or first-round interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The market is highly competitive, with companies often receiving thousands of applications for a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This competition is particularly high for coveted remote and even hybrid roles, as companies are increasingly less likely to be "remote-first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Job seekers are now competing with double or triple the number of candidates compared to just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The job market has significantly changed from 2021 and most of 2022, which was considered a "heyday" for job seekers when companies were aggressively recruiting talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Impact on the Tech Industry

During the 2021-2022 period, many individuals rebranded themselves for technical roles and the tech boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, for those who finished their training later in 2022 or 2023, the bottom fell out of the tech market, and lucrative job offers dried up overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This has resulted in a surplus of people who shifted careers now struggling to find jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While the tech industry is a prime example, other sectors have also been affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Many who participated in the "great resignation" took remote jobs under the assumption of a permanent remote work life, but now companies are increasingly mandating returns to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Individuals considering quitting due to these mandates or a desire to avoid hybrid roles are finding that job opportunities are far less frequent than they were a couple of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Signs of Economic Cooldown

There are increasing [[impact_of_economic_downturns_on_job_availability | signs of an economic cooldown]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This is accompanied by fewer lucrative job offers as companies begin to reset salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This trend is unfavorable for those looking to jump to a new company for a salary increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Many who participated in the "great resignation" are now feeling stuck or regretting their decisions, leading to a phenomenon known as the "Great Regret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Strategic Career Management

While it's important not to tolerate poor employers and to reclaim control of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, quitting a job as the first option is rarely the right answer and requires a more strategic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] When to Consider Quitting
> Quitting should be considered in genuinely toxic situations, such as being asked to do something illegal or unethical, or in cases of bonafide harassment or a hostile work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Even in these cases, it's crucial to proceed with "eyes wide open" to the current labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

For those currently employed, the recommendation is to "buckle down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Focus on improving your resume to compete effectively in a market with thousands of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. It's important to jump for the right opportunity, not just for a slight salary increase or because of minor dissatisfaction with a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Over the next few months, stability and finding a job or industry with growth and strength will be paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. To act as the "CEO of your career," it's vital to make smart, strategic decisions rather than knee-jerk reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Do not quit a job without a clear strategy for your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

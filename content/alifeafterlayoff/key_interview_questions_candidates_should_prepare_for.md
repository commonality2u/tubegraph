Preparing for a job interview is crucial, and mastering the art of storytelling can significantly impress hiring managers, ultimately increasing your chances of landing an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Your goal in an interview is to present yourself as the best possible fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## The STAR Methodology

One highly effective method for [[strategies_for_answering_common_interview_questions | answering interview questions]] is the tried and true STAR methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This framework helps you structure your responses to behavioral questions in a clear, concise, and compelling way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **S - Situation**: Provide context, introducing the "hero" (you) into the story and explaining why you were in that particular situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **T - Task**: Describe what the "hero" (you) needed to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **A - Action**: Detail the specific actions you took to achieve the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **R - Result**: Explain the outcome, or the "happily ever after," of your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Keeping the STAR methodology in mind when [[preparing_for_interviews_with_targeted_responses | preparing your interview answers]] is recommended because "it's tried and true and quite simply it works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Key Questions to Prepare For

It is strongly recommended that you take time before your interview to [[preparing_for_interviews_with_targeted_responses | prepare answers to some commonly asked questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### 1. Tell Me About Yourself

This is almost guaranteed to be asked in nearly every interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The interviewer wants context as to why you are there, beyond just your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Use this as an opportunity to add "flavor or color commentary" to your background and share why you are the best fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Avoid discussing non-related hobbies, personal life details, or rambling about unrelated topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Everything you share should be calculated to show you are the best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

> [!example] Sample Answer for an Engineering Role (5 years into career)
> "I've always had an interest in how things work dating back to when I was a kid. In fact, I helped my dad rebuild a 1969 Chevelle, which sparked my interest in mechanical engineering. So I made a decision to study that in school, and early in my career, I gravitated toward heavy manufacturing and solving complex problems. Big machines and impossible problems excite me. One particularly enjoyable challenge is when I had to restore an idle production line with a $300,000 capital improvement project. I led this install, and I'd be happy to share more details on how I completed this project under budget and two weeks ahead of schedule." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

### 2. Why Do You Want to Work Here? / Why Should We Hire You?

Interviewers want to know your genuine interest in the company or the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Be honest and ensure the job fits nicely into your career path, as sincerity is easier to convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Connect your answer to the specific job and pull in something unique about the company that differentiates you from other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Show excitement for the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

> [!example] Sample Answer for a YouTube Role
> "YouTube is well-known as an innovator in the social media space, and I'm an avid consumer of the service. In addition, I've been following along the YouTube corporate page, and it seems like your teams are really engaged, passionate, and seem to have a lot of fun. In my most recent job, I had a chance to impact several major mobile application projects, but at a little bit of a smaller scope. So the next logical step for me is to apply these same skills but on more of an enterprise-wide scale, and I feel like this role provides an outstanding challenge for me to do so, and I think that's why I'm so intrigued about this opportunity at YouTube." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

### 3. What's Your Greatest Weakness?

This question can be tricky, as candidates often feel forced to admit a weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Avoid generic or overused answers like "I'm too detail-oriented" or "I care too much," as hiring managers will see through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Choose a real weakness that won't paint you in a bad light for the specific job (e.g., don't say you're bad with numbers for an accounting role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Explain the impact of the weakness and, most importantly, share a solid example of how you learned from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Greatest Strength (Flip Side)**: When asked about your greatest strength, pull from the job posting to make it work-related and focus on a competency most important for success in that role. Be honest and give a great example in the STAR format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### 4. What's Your Greatest Professional Accomplishment?

Companies typically seek to hire high achievers, especially in the type of work they are recruiting for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Put yourself in the hiring manager's shoes and choose an accomplishment most relevant to the job you're applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Deliver your answer using the STAR format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

> [!example] Sample Answer for a Product Manager Role at a SaaS Company
> "My greatest professional accomplishment was a key contributor to a major product launch at my last company. In my role as a product manager, I was tasked with bringing to market a high-profile software platform. In particular, I was responsible for ensuring that the product teams were aligned. I coordinated tight deadlines of deliverables among six global development teams, and then I removed roadblocks to ensure that all of our goals were met. A particularly challenging issue came up at the 11th hour where the dev team actually made a code-breaking error that was about to go out the door, but I ended up catching it at the last minute. We were able to troubleshoot it, and I was able to get the relevant team to correct the issue before we went live. The product was launched with great success, and as a result, I was actually formally recognized with the promotion. And to this day, that's my biggest professional accomplishment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>

### 5. What Are Your Salary Expectations?

This question is often asked in preliminary interviews with recruiters and is very important because the number you give can follow you throughout the process, making it hard to change later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Despite salary transparency trends, published ranges can be abnormally wide and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. You should be in control of the compensation discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    1.  **Research**: Conduct thorough salary research beforehand to know your minimum acceptable salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    2.  **Deflect First**: When asked, try to put it back on the interviewer by asking if they are willing to share their range first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    3.  **Provide a Range**: If they push back, offer a strategic range. State what other opportunities you're considering are paying, including the number you need to be satisfied without looking around again, and add 20% above that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
        *   Example: "Other opportunities that I'm considering are paying between $100,000 and $120,000. Does that seem to make sense with you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    *   **Avoid**: Do not answer with your previous salary or simply what you would *like* to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Giving a range provides wiggle room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### 6. Asking Your Own Questions

At the end of an interview, interviewers will typically ask if you have any questions for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Be effective by trying to get some job-specific questions answered earlier in the interview, which can provide advantages during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This final opportunity allows you to ask about the job, working conditions, hours, or shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. If salary expectations haven't been discussed and the recruiter has committed to moving you forward, this is a good time to bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

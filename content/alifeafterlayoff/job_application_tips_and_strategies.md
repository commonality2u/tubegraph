The modern job market presents conflicting data, with some indicators suggesting robustness and a record number of job openings, while major corporations simultaneously announce layoffs [00:00:35]. This discrepancy is partly due to the rise of "ghost job postings" [00:00:25]. Understanding and navigating these fake listings is crucial for effective [[effective_job_search_strategies | job searching]] and ensuring your [[strategies_for_standing_out_in_job_applications | job applications]] are well-placed.

## Understanding Ghost Job Postings

A "ghost posting" is a job advertisement that an employer has no real intention of ever filling [00:01:30]. These are often referred to as "pipelining wrecks," where the goal is to collect resumes for a future date without immediate hiring plans [00:01:41]. This practice creates a poor candidate experience, as job seekers invest time in creating tailored resumes and applications for positions that aren't genuinely open [00:02:11].

### Employer Motivations for Ghost Postings

A Clarify Capital survey conducted in August-September 2022, which interviewed 1045 managers involved in hiring, revealed several reasons for ghost jobs [00:04:22]:

*   **Always Open to New People (50%)** The company wants to keep requisitions open to see if an "irresistible candidate" applies, essentially "window shopping" without an intention to hire [00:06:57]. This is considered lazy and irresponsible recruiting [00:10:01].
*   **To Keep Current Employees Motivated** This reason is particularly "sinister," as it involves tricking overworked employees into believing help is coming [00:10:05]. If the "cavalry never shows up," employees may be victims of ghost requisitions [00:10:31].
*   **To Give the Impression the Company is Growing** This can be deceitful to both job candidates and investors, potentially having legal implications from an SEC perspective [00:08:02].
*   **To Have an Active Pool of Candidates in Case of Turnover** Companies maintain talent pools, mirroring the advice for job seekers to always be ready for new opportunities [00:09:19].
*   **Job Was Filled / Forgot to Delete the Job** In these cases, the recruiter or HR person should have pulled the job posting down; there's no excuse for keeping it open [00:08:57].
*   **No Particular Reason (They Simply Don't Care)** [00:10:47]

A significant finding from the survey was that 50% of managers keep job postings open because "they're always open to new people" [00:05:43]. Additionally, one in five managers did not plan to fill open positions until 2023 (based on a 2022 survey) [00:05:29].

## Identifying and Avoiding Ghost Postings

To avoid falling victim to ghost jobs, job seekers should conduct their own due diligence, similar to a "reverse reference check" [00:11:53]:

*   **Check the Posting Date** If a job has been listed for over six months, it's likely a ghost wreck or indicates issues with the employer (e.g., indecisive hiring manager, high turnover) [00:11:05].
*   **Monitor Repetitive Postings** If the same requisition is continually reposted over a long period, it's a strong indicator of a ghost job [00:11:11].
*   **Research Company Layoffs** Investigate if the company recently had a major layoff and if the posted positions are in roles affected by those layoffs. If so, they might be collecting resumes for future rehiring, making the position vulnerable [00:11:36].
*   **Analyze Job Description Detail** A legitimate, serious job opening will have a detailed job description with specifics about accomplishments and support structures [00:12:02]. Generic or "salesy" descriptions that lack specific role details are a red flag for pipelining wrecks [00:12:22].
*   **Consider Recency of Post** A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an active and legitimate recruitment effort [00:12:33].

## General [[effective_job_search_strategies | Job Search Strategies]]

*   **Act Like a Free Agent** Always keep your resume updated and be open to new opportunities, as companies themselves maintain candidate pools [00:09:25].
*   **Focus on Quality Roles** Prioritize applying for high-quality roles with legitimate employers who have actual hiring intentions [00:13:02].

While [[pros_of_contract_work | contract positions]] can offer immediate employment and valuable experience, there are several disadvantages compared to [[contract_work_vs_fulltime_employment | full-time employment]].

## Stigma and Perception
There can be a stigma associated with working a contract position, as it may feel like a temporary role rather than a full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers may view a series of short-term contract roles as a "hopping resume," indicating a lack of long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This can create a bias, as employers often seek candidates who demonstrate buy-in to long-term projects, process improvement, and the ability to build lasting relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. While this might be less of a concern for those nearing the end of their career, younger professionals may need to fight this perception if they accumulate too many short-term contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Lack of Benefits
A significant [[financial_considerations_in_contract_vs_fulltime_work | financial consideration]] is that contract positions typically do not include benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While some agencies may offer benefits, they are usually inferior to the comprehensive packages provided by large corporations for their full-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Sense of Limbo and Instability
Contract work can create a sense of limbo, putting major life plans on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Contractors must continuously look for new positions and plan for what comes after their current contract ends, especially if a conversion to full-time is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This instability can impact the ability to pursue major life events, such as buying a house or having children, which often require a stable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Lack of Employer Commitment and Team Belonging
In many contract situations, the employer is not fully committed to the contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. There are typically no defined career opportunities or a sense of long-term loyalty from the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This can lead to a feeling of not truly belonging to the team, as contractors may be aware that they are temporary and might not be around for future projects or long-term initiatives discussed within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This contrasts with the experience of a full-time employee who often feels more ingrained in the company culture and future.

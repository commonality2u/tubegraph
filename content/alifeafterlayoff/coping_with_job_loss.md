Getting laid off can be one of the most catastrophic experiences in a professional career, often happening for the first time for many individuals in today's job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This article provides advice on how to navigate a layoff, focusing on what to do and, importantly, what not to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Immediate Aftermath: Shock and Grief

The typical scenario of a layoff often involves an unexpected meeting invite with your boss and HR, followed by a pre-canned speech explaining the job's termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This experience can lead to a state of shock, where the world seems to stop spinning, and you are left processing a sudden loss of access to your work computer and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Many feel dumbfounded and unsure what to say when asked questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The most shocking aspect for many is the feeling of betrayal—a betrayal of trust and honesty—which can make you feel worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It's normal to enter a [[the_concept_of_surviving_a_layoff | State of Shock]] and go through a mourning process, as you are experiencing a real loss with stages of grief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Processing Emotions
It is crucial to process what has happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>. Allow yourself to get angry, mad, and second-guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>. Boiling these emotions to the surface is healthy; bottling them up will only worsen things long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08">[03:08]</a>. Accept that you are wounded and need time to heal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14">[03:14]</a>. If laid off mid-week, consider taking the rest of the week off to clear your mind, perhaps by driving or going on a nature hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14">[02:14]</a>.

## Assessing Your Situation and [[financial_planning_after_a_layoff | Financial Planning after a Layoff]]

After processing the initial shock, you must assess your financial situation, including bills, budget, and monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25">[03:25]</a>. This is the time to make difficult decisions and change spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>.

### Budgeting and Cost Reduction
Reviewing expenses closely is vital to determine where to cut, especially non-value-adding costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57">[03:57]</a>. This may include:
*   Canceling subscription services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>.
*   Skipping planned vacations and getting refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>.
*   Reconsidering expensive car payments to avoid ruining credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>.
*   Foregoing non-essential activities like fantasy football leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>.

The goal is to reduce your liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>.

### Emergency Funds and Income Sources
Examine your savings, ideally an emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>. If no emergency fund exists, you might need to quickly seek part-time work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>. Unemployment benefits are often minimal (e.g., maximum $200 a week in Tennessee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.

Consider all potential cash flow sources:
*   Unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>.
*   Severance packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>.
*   Vacation payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>.
*   As a last resort, retirement accounts should be avoided to prevent cannibalizing long-term financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39">[05:39]</a>.

## Developing a [[strategies_for_career_management_postlayoff | Career Strategy]]

Panic is easy, but developing a defined plan is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14">[05:14]</a>. Rushing into a job search or immediately updating your resume should not be the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48">[05:48]</a>.

### Strategic Job Search
First, focus on creating a [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_planning_amid_layoffs | career strategy]] to plan your next steps carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>. Taking an "ideal" job out of a knee-jerk reaction or one that is a step backward in responsibility and pay can hurt your career in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>. Every job either strengthens or weakens your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20">[06:20]</a>. Only after this strategy is mapped out should you update your resume and begin an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29">[06:29]</a>.

### Networking
Tap into your networks, especially LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35">[06:35]</a>. Networking is highly beneficial for getting back on your feet or gaining moral support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>. If your network isn't optimized, dedicate energy to improving it, as consistent networking is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57">[06:57]</a>.

### Skill Development and Interview Preparation
Assess your current skill set against market demands by looking at job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15">[07:15]</a>. If you notice critical skill gaps, this is the time to brush up on them through:
*   Free courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27">[07:27]</a>.
*   Volunteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28">[07:28]</a>.
*   Shadowing or mentoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31">[07:31]</a>.

Make yourself as attractive a candidate as possible, ensuring relevant keywords are on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">[07:33]</a>. Additionally, brush up on your [[how_to_handle_job_interviews_after_leaving_a_job | interview skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53">[07:53]</a>. Interviewing can be intimidating, especially with the pressure of securing the next opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>. Develop a strong interview game to maximize your chances of getting noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>.

## Severance Package and Benefits

Do not immediately sign your severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21">[08:21]</a>. Take time (usually a couple of weeks) to understand its contents and if anything is negotiable, especially regarding the continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26">[08:26]</a>.

### COBRA and Health Insurance
Companies offer COBRA for continued benefits, but it's at your cost and can be extremely expensive, as you pay for the company's full suite of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57">[08:57]</a>. Consider opting out of COBRA and requesting any continuation of benefits paid as a lump sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27">[09:27]</a>. Then, explore the government marketplace for a new plan primarily covering catastrophic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33">[09:33]</a>. There are tax benefits for those with drastically reduced incomes, which can save you thousands of dollars and stretch your funds further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39">[09:39]</a>.

### Negotiating Severance
While laid off individuals have less leverage, if you belong to a protected class (e.g., over 40 years old), companies may want to shelter their liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56">[09:56]</a>. It's worth asking for extra benefits, such as a missed bonus or unvested equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a>.

### Outplacement Assistance
Often, companies offer outplacement assistance for a period, which involves a company helping with resumes, job searches, and consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>. However, the advice and resumes provided by some outplacement services can be "horrifically bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11">[11:11]</a>. It's recommended to ask for this assistance as a lump sum (often $3,000 to $5,000) instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32">[11:32]</a>. This allows you to choose your own career coach, potentially save money, and receive a better level of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36">[11:36]</a>.

## Seeking Professional Support

If struggling with your job search and starting to panic, it's crucial to seek help to avoid actions not in your long-term interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04">[12:04]</a>. Resources like "A Life After Layoff" provide valuable content, including interview advice and job search strategies, from a corporate recruiter's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15">[12:15]</a>. The website, alifeafterlayoff.com, offers free resources and training courses such as "Unlocking LinkedIn," "Resume Rocket Fuel" (for resume strategy), and "Ultimate Job Seeker Bootcamp" (an A-to-Z guide on the job search process, including negotiation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42">[12:42]</a>. Private coaching is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37">[13:37]</a>.

If you are experiencing a layoff or income disruption, remember that support is available to help you process it in the most effective way possible and get back into the workforce quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[02:37]</a>.

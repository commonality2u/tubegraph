An extraordinary [[job_interview_experiences | job interview experience]] involving an unemployed individual being set up for an interview with the very company that had just fired him was shared by Brian from Life After Layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Bizarre Scenario
A man, known by his Twitter handle "fur," was terminated from his job. Shortly thereafter, a recruiter contacted him, offering an interview for the *same position* at the *same employer* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Crucially, neither the company nor the recruiter seemed aware they were inviting their recently terminated employee back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Fur documented the entire process on Twitter in a play-by-play format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Initial Confusion and Confirmation
Fur expressed his disbelief, stating he wished he was "making this up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The recruiter's unawareness was deemed an "embarrassment," particularly for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Fur secured a confirmed interview for the exact position from which he had just been terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Being stable with freelance work and other interviews, Fur decided to have "a little bit of fun" with the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## The Interview Day: A Comedy of Errors
Fur decided to attend the on-site interview wearing his old uniform and a fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Lack of Recognition
The interview manager (hiring manager) called to confirm the appointment, and Fur expressed excitement, yet the manager showed no sign of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This highlighted a significant [[signs_of_organizational_dysfunction_during_interviews | red flag]] for the company, suggesting a disconnect where managers don't know the names of terminated employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

At the front desk, despite wearing a fake mustache, the receptionist was "unfazed," even though they were likely aware of his previous termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He was also asked to wear a face mask, further obscuring his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Remarkably, his phone still connected to the company's Wi-Fi, implying a security lapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### The Interview Process
The hiring manager for this role was someone Fur had not met before, suggesting he might be interviewing for a different position within the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Fur's resume did not list his old jobs by name, only a "cut and paste" of the job listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

The hiring manager offered him snacks, a surprisingly nice gesture for an interview candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Fur also noted he was in a different building, limiting chances of running into former co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The hiring manager deemed Fur an "ideal candidate" but admitted they weren't "technical enough to ask... hard questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This points to a [[common_mistakes_in_the_hiring_process | common mistake in the hiring process]] where managers may lack expertise in the roles they oversee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. An engineer was brought in to conduct the technical interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While waiting, Fur received even more snacks, including a large bag of gummy bears and beef jerky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

During the technical interview, the engineer remarked, "I think I've seen you around, you ever freelance here before?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Fur responded truthfully that he freelanced in many places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, essentially "not saying a single lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The interview went well because Fur "knows the job really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## The Climax: Discovery and Confrontation
After multiple rounds of interviews and several hours, the company finally realized who their candidate was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. A very serious engineer asked if he was there to "re-interview" for the job, and Fur replied, "I don't understand the re part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

The hiring manager returned, "furious" that Fur had not disclosed his previous termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Fur countered by saying he couldn't recall things, as "things changed so much," noting it had only been two weeks since he was fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He even offered the furious manager a gummy bear, which was declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. It's assumed Fur was then asked to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Reflections on Company Practices
This incident highlights significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags during job interviews]] regarding the company's hiring and HR processes:
- **Lack of Internal Communication** The company reached out to a recently terminated employee within two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
- **Recruiter Oversight** While a recruiter might not immediately recall every terminated name, such a short timeframe for the same position should trigger alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Typically, a recruiter would ask if a new position is a replacement and why the previous employee was terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
- **Hiring Manager Disconnect** The hiring manager had no recollection of the employee, despite him being fired from the *same job* just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
- **Organizational Dysfunction** The entire process suggests major [[common_mistakes_in_the_hiring_process | common mistakes in the hiring process]] and [[signs_of_organizational_dysfunction_during_interviews | signs of organizational dysfunction during interviews]], raising questions about their HR and management systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Despite the awkwardness, the incident provided a memorable, if farcical, example of an interview mishap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

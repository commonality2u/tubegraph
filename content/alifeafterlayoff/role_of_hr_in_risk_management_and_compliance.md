Human Resources (HR) is often viewed by employees as a supportive advocate; however, its fundamental purpose within an organization is to act as a strategic business partner, primarily focusing on risk mitigation and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Speaker's Background and Perspective
The speaker, with 20 years of experience in HR management and recruiting for both large and small companies, aims to dispel common [[human_resources_myths_and_truths | myths about HR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While acknowledging that many HR professionals are compassionate and believe in doing the right thing for employees, there is a strategic layer to the function that employees should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## HR's True Purpose: Risk, Avoidance, and Compliance
At its core, the Human Resources function is a business department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. HR's primary purpose is to mitigate risk, implement risk avoidance, and ensure compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This overarching directive ensures the company avoids legal hot water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Historically, HR departments, originally known as "personnel departments" 80 to 100 years ago, were established to staff mega-corporations for industrial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Their role was to advocate for the business to ensure it had the necessary resources, not primarily for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Strategic Alignment and Business Decisions
Following risk mitigation, HR's next priority is [[strategic_alignment_of_hr_with_business_goals | strategic alignment with business decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. HR departments align talent with the overall [[strategic_alignment_of_hr_with_business_goals | business strategy]], ensuring the right people are in place to achieve executive goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

This strategic alignment is often where employees experience adverse employment decisions or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. If an employee's position or contribution is no longer a strategic alignment for the company's direction, they may be let go, not because they are a bad employee, but due to a business decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. At this level, employees can become a name, a number, or data on a chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The "coldness and calculatedness" HR is often criticized for stems from these objective, business-driven decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

While individual HR representatives at the local level may be compassionate and genuinely interested in helping employees with paycheck issues or benefits, the higher up the organization, the more strategic and calculated HR's function becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### When to Engage HR Strategically
Employees should consider how to [[navigating_human_resources | navigate human resources]] strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If experiencing **legal issues**, such as harassment or illegal activities, it is crucial to report them to HR. Not doing so can put the employee in a bigger issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

However, for issues like performance problems or personality conflicts with a boss or co-worker, the speaker advises attempting to resolve them independently before involving HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. When HR hears something, especially regarding potential risk, they are required to escalate it up the corporate ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. HR listens for legal risk in what is being reported, and if they become aware of a risk, they are held liable to minimize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Therefore, venting or complaining to HR without a clear strategic purpose is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### The "Ugly Truth"
The perception that HR is an employee's friend is a "cold hard reality" that many learn too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. While HR serves functions like attracting, developing, and retaining talent, and handling benefits, its core objective remains protecting the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

> [00:13:48] "It's almost like a betrayal in a way... you've placed your trust into an organization that ultimately at the end of the day is going to make the best business decision."

It is important for employees to take ownership of their careers and manage themselves as "free agents" rather than allowing organizations to completely steer their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This proactive approach helps reduce the [[emotional_impact_of_hr_decisions_on_employees | emotional impact]] of adverse business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

<div class="callout-title">Key Takeaway</div>
HR, at its highest level, is aligned with business senior leaders. Going into interactions believing HR is designed to be your friend is a misconception.

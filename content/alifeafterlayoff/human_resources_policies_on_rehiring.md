It is an unfortunate reality that some companies maintain "do not hire" lists or "block lists" for former employees, and even for external candidates. While not always a widespread practice, it can create significant barriers to re-employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:03">[08:01:03]</a>.

## Formal Blacklisting: Former Employees
Companies like Meta have confirmed they keep block lists for former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. This means individuals deemed ineligible for rehire are flagged internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:07">[05:05:07]</a>.

### Meta's "Do Not Hire" List
A Business Insider expos√© revealed that former Meta employees were blocked from being rehired, effectively placed on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.

**Case Study: Senior Engineer**
A senior engineer, who was part of Meta's massive 2022 layoffs (not considered performance-based at the time) and had "exceeded expectations" in their performance ratings, found themselves unable to be rehired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. Despite being told their layoff was a "business decision" and having multiple hiring managers express interest in bringing them back, [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | Human Resources]] policies stepped in, leading to them being blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>.

After applying for nearly 20 positions, the engineer noticed a pattern: hiring managers would show interest and even set up screening calls with recruiters, only for the company's internal recruiter to "ghost" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:07">[03:56:07]</a>. Eventually, the engineer learned from a hiring manager that the recruiting team had forbidden contact because they were "deemed ineligible for rehire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:03">[05:02:03]</a>.

### How Companies Track Ineligibility
Meta, and many other companies, utilize multiple systems to track rehire ineligibility, including a "non-regrettable attrition designation" and a "do not hire flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:06">[05:45:06]</a>. This information is typically stored in the HRIS (Human Resources Information System), where all employment data resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:50">[06:06:50]</a>. Recruiters often cannot directly see these flags and must consult with [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | Human Resources]] to get approval for rehiring former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:26">[06:24:26]</a>.

### Reasons for Being Blacklisted (Formal)
While official spokespersons claim clear criteria, former managers suggest broader discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:05">[10:09:05]</a>. Common reasons for formal blacklisting include:
*   Violating workplace policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:24">[09:22:24]</a>
*   Stealing confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:13">[09:28:13]</a>
*   Underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>
*   The "reason for separation" at the time of departure, such as "rage quitting" without notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:04">[10:22:04]</a>
*   Policy violations, performance terminations, or involuntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:26">[11:06:26]</a>
*   "Non-regrettable attrition," indicating the company was happy for the person to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:47">[11:42:47]</a>.

It is possible for managers to add names to this list without documented performance issues, simply if they "didn't like" the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:40">[09:40:40]</a>. Once on this list, the "do not hire" status can follow an individual permanently, even if the original manager or team members have left the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:39">[10:58:39]</a>.

### How it Manifests in the Hiring Process
For blacklisted candidates, initial communication with recruiters might be smooth, but once they interact with the company on a deeper level, communication slows down, answers become vague, and eventually, a rejection letter is received without clear reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:18">[12:02:18]</a>.

### How to Find Out You're Blacklisted
It is unlikely a company will disclose if you are on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. The most common way former Meta employees discovered their status was through third-party headhunting agencies or recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:21">[09:06:21]</a>. These external recruiters, after submitting a candidate, would be informed by the company that the individual is on a "do not hire" list, which they then disclose to the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:03">[08:44:03]</a>.

## Informal Blacklisting: New Applicants
Even if you haven't worked for a company before, you can still face a form of informal blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:07">[12:57:07]</a>.

### Excessive Applications
Applying for the same job repeatedly, or for numerous different, unrelated jobs at a company (e.g., 30-40 applications), can lead to an informal bias against a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:14">[13:06:14]</a>. Staffing teams and hiring managers may see the extensive application history and question why other teams haven't hired them, or what issues exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:40">[13:26:40]</a>. This can make an applicant appear "spammy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

### Failed Interview Processes
Some companies track candidate interview history closely. For example, Amazon noted if candidates went through "loops" (interview processes) with other hiring teams and were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:49">[13:40:49]</a>.

*   **"Recycle Period"**: If a candidate lacked a technical skill (e.g., coding), they might have a "recycle period" of about six months, allowing them to improve and reapply later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:30">[13:51:30]</a>.
*   **Permanent Ban**: If removed from the interview process due to failing "leadership principles" (behavior-based interview questions), there was often no recycling, effectively banning them permanently from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:40">[14:21:40]</a>.

## Backdoor References
A "backdoor reference" occurs when a hiring team member contacts someone they know at a candidate's former company (who was not provided as a reference) to inquire about the candidate's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. These unofficial references can significantly hinder a candidate's chances and even lead to blacklisting, though the candidate will likely never know this happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:19">[16:54:19]</a>. This practice is common in smaller, interconnected industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
While some employers actively use "do not hire" lists and similar policies, it is not believed to be a widespread practice across all industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:21">[17:18:21]</a>. Job seekers should focus on reclaiming control over their careers and not dwell on the policies of a single company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:02">[17:40:02]</a>.

When interviewing for a new position, it's crucial to carefully consider what you reveal about your reasons for leaving your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:04"></a>. While honesty is important, you don't necessarily need to share the entire truth, especially if your reasons are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:02"></a>.

## Avoid Negative Commentary on Current Employer
Sharing negative reasons for leaving, such as having a disliked boss, feeling bored, or believing the company treated you poorly, can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11"></a>. Recruiters and hiring managers may interpret such statements negatively:

-   **Disliking a Boss:** If you state you left because your boss was "terrible" or "you butted heads," an employer might perceive you as "difficult to work with" or a potential "problem" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21"></a>. This can be a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:29"></a>.
-   **Boredom/Lack of Challenge:** Expressing that your previous job didn't challenge you enough might lead an employer to believe you lack initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:53"></a>. They might expect a "go-getter" to find more enriching work within their existing role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:49"></a>.

> [!TIP]
> The best approach is to identify the true reason for your departure and articulate it in a way that doesn't come across as threatening or negative to a potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:06"></a>.

## Be Cautious with Long-Term Career Plans
Interviewers often ask about your career plans or where you see yourself in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:48"></a>. They are looking for commitment to the career path and the ability to grow within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:41"></a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Revealing plans such as starting a business or completely switching careers within five years is generally not viewed positively and can even be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:43"></a>. This suggests a lack of passion for the type of work you are interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:50"></a>. You need to convey a level of passion for the work you are seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:43"></a>.

If you do have plans for a career shift or to start a business, it's advisable to strategize how you will message this during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:23"></a>.

## Avoid Appearing Desperate
It's important not to reveal desperation for a job, even if you are experiencing urgency due to being laid off or fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:27"></a>. An employer hearing that you are desperate is similar to the dating world, where high urgency often pushes the desired outcome further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:03"></a>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if you are facing financial hardship, you must convey a calm and collected demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:07"></a>. Overeagerness or expressing desperation can lead to being put into the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:39"></a>.

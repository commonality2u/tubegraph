Understanding and addressing negative feedback from your manager is crucial for maintaining your employment and career growth. Often, such feedback comes in various forms, signaling potential issues with your job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Signs of Displeasure from Your Boss
A key indicator of a manager's dissatisfaction is a sudden shift in their perception of your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. If your boss is unexpectedly displeased with your output, it's essential to identify what isn't meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Other significant [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | signs of a problematic boss]] or impending issues include:
*   **Work Redistribution**: If clients you once supported or projects you were involved with are taken away and given to others, it indicates a loss of faith in your ability to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Exclusion from Key Discussions**: Not being invited to important meetings you previously attended, or your boss replacing you in those discussions, suggests they are doing damage control or distancing you from a project or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **"Weirdness" from Other Groups**: If cross-functional leaders or other groups you support start acting strangely or withholding information, it's a red flag indicating potential major issues with your standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Plummeting Performance Appraisals
One of the most concrete forms of negative feedback is a drastic drop in your performance appraisal scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. If you have a history of decent appraisals and are suddenly caught off guard with a critical, much lower appraisal, it's a significant warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This often means your manager is documenting your dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, which is a clear [[effects_of_lackluster_performance_appraisals_and_disengaged_management | effect of lackluster performance appraisals]].

### HR Involvement in Performance Documentation
When a manager informs HR about an employee not meeting expectations and expresses a desire to replace them, HR's first step is to review the employee's file, including past performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. To limit liability for the company, HR will typically require the manager to establish a "paper trail" by having documented coaching sessions and reflecting these performance issues in appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This is part of the [[handling_of_employee_complaints_by_hr | handling of employee complaints by HR]] and broader employment practices.

### Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is often a last resort for performance-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This is a defined period with measurable goals that you must meet to retain your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. If you fail to meet these metrics within the PIP's timeframe, the usual result is termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

!> **Taking a PIP Seriously**: Being put on a PIP is a huge red flag that should be taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. While it often signals impending termination, it's possible to improve your performance during the PIP and return to the regular workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Your ability to elevate your performance to meet the group's standards and move past this poor performance period is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## How to Respond to Negative Feedback
When faced with negative feedback or [[signs_of_a_problematic_boss | signs of a problematic boss]], it's crucial to be proactive.

*   **Seek Clarity**: If your boss is suddenly displeased, consider proactively meeting with them to better understand expectations and ask for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This can help address the issue before it escalates to formal documentation.
*   **Focus on Performance**: If your metrics are significantly lower than your co-workers, either concentrate on improving your performance or re-evaluate if the role is the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Take Action**: If you notice any of these signs, you should start thinking about your next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Whether you attempt to address the performance issues directly or decide to seek a new opportunity, concerted effort and action are required to either salvage the situation or move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

When an employee tenders their resignation, Human Resources (HR) typically invites them to participate in an exit interview [00:00:03]. These interviews are conducted to gather data on overall trends within the workforce and how they relate to the market [00:01:09].

## Purpose of Exit Interviews

The primary reason companies conduct exit interviews is to collect data that can reveal [[signs_of_high_turnover_and_its_implications | employment trends]] they need to address proactively [00:01:30]. For instance, if many employees are leaving due to uncompetitive compensation or benefits issues, this data can inform potential corrective actions [00:01:16].

### Types of Turnover

While some "healthy turnover" or "churn" is natural in any organization [00:01:37], companies are most concerned about [[employee_turnover_and_company_stability | voluntary turnover]] [00:01:42]. Good organizations track this specifically to determine if there's a larger underlying problem [00:01:45].

### Managerial Impact

Exit interview data can also highlight specific managerial issues. If a particular manager consistently has [[high_turnover_rates | higher or abnormally high turnover rates]] than the rest of the organization, HR might investigate that manager's style [00:01:52]. This could lead to retraining or troubleshooting to understand and resolve the reasons for the high turnover [00:02:01]. The intention behind collecting this data is generally not sinister; it's to gather information [00:02:07].

## How Exit Interviews are Conducted

Typically, an HR representative, which could be a manager, mid-level, or even entry-level personnel, conducts the exit interview [00:02:26]. They usually follow a standard form, asking questions such as:
*   Why the employee decided to leave [00:02:38]
*   Where they are going next [00:02:41]
*   Any feedback they can provide [00:02:46]
*   Their opinion of their boss [00:02:49]
*   Whether they would consider returning to work for the company in the future [00:02:52]

The collected information is often stored, potentially within the employee's employment file [00:03:03]. Some large companies utilize third-party organizations to collect this data, which then generate reports for executive-level review to track trends [00:03:18].

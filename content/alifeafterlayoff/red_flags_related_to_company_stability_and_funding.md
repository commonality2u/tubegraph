When evaluating a potential employer, it's crucial to identify [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flags]] that indicate instability or insufficient funding, as a poor employer can significantly hinder your career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Recognizing these signs can help you avoid [[poor quality employers | poor quality employers]] and jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Company Not Being Funded (Red Flag #5)

A significant [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] is when a company appears to lack proper funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Longevity and Funding

*   **New Companies:** While some new companies, like tech startups, may have legitimate reasons for their short existence, even reputable startups should possess adequate funding to compensate their employees fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapped for Funding:** If a company explicitly states they cannot afford to pay you more due to being "bootstrapped for funding," this is a [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This often means they will be "bootstrapped on everything else," severely limiting their chances of business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Overnight Appearance:** Be cautious of companies that seem to have "popped up overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Verifying Company Legitimacy

Investigate the company's public presence and resources:
*   **Website Review:** Examine their website for legitimacy. Look for actual press releases rather than generic language and stock photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Physical Presence:** Check if they have a legitimate business address and multiple physical locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. If local, consider driving by to confirm people are working in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Resources for Market Pursuit:** Assess if they appear to have the necessary resources to pursue their stated business markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Expectation of Self-Provisioning

*   **Asking for Personal Equipment:** A significant [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] is if a company asks you to provide your own equipment for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Standard Company Provision:** Reputable companies typically cover employee training, expenses, equipment, transportation, and software costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It can be tempting to accept any position when desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, some positions must be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Strategically approaching your career can help you avoid accepting subpar jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## The Scenario of a Counteroffer
Many individuals find themselves unhappy at work due to feeling underappreciated, underpaid, being passed up for a promotion, or being completely overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This often leads to exploring other job opportunities, going through interview processes, and eventually landing a new job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. When the current company is informed of this situation, they may "scramble" and present a [[how_to_navigate_job_offers_and_counter_offers | counteroffer]], promising things like a new job title or a larger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Why You Should Never Accept a Counteroffer
A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises that you should "never accept a [[why_you_should_not_accept_a_counteroffer | counteroffer]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Deciding between a new opportunity and accepting a counteroffer can be stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Statistical Reality of Counteroffers
Based on real-life experience and statistics, many candidates who accept a [[why_you_should_not_accept_a_counteroffer | counteroffer]] from their current employer are often back on the market looking for a new position within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

According to LinkedIn:
*   An overwhelming majority (80% or more) of people who accept [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | counteroffers]] will not be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   An even more staggering 93% will not be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

This data suggests that [[recognizing_when_to_consider_a_counter_offer | considering a counter offer]] requires careful thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Reasons Not to Accept a Counteroffer

### Persistent Underlying Issues
The primary reason not to accept a [[why_you_should_not_accept_a_counteroffer | counteroffer]] is that the original motivations for seeking new employment will likely persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   A bad boss or poor company culture will remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Work-life balance issues, difficult commutes, or terrible benefits are unlikely to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Workplace conditions may see a "honeymoon period" but will eventually revert to previous issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

If you reached the point of considering another offer, it's typically for a good reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. You should keep your options open as a "free agent" and be "selfish with your career" because no one else will look out for your best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Companies can lay off long-tenured employees with little warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Leaving a bad boss, poor work culture, or dying industry is considered both the "right thing to do" and the "smart thing to do for your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Employer's Motives Behind Counteroffers
You should question why your employer is [[counteroffers_and_retaining_top_talent | countering]] your offer *now* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>:
*   **Undervaluing**: They were effectively undervaluing you until you decided or threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Buying Time**: They might have been caught off guard with no contingency plan and are using the counteroffer to buy time to replace you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Damaged Relationships**: Your relationships within the company are unlikely to be the same, and your employer will likely begin searching for your replacement or developing a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Redundancy**: By broadcasting your intention to leave, you've made yourself redundant in the eyes of your boss, who will now actively plan for your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: You will likely be labeled as someone not long-term committed to the business goals, making you a potential target for layoffs or other adverse employment decisions, especially if your salary is higher after accepting the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Delayed Recognition**: If you were offered a promotion or higher salary, question why it took a threat to leave for them to recognize your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. They either became complacent or took advantage of you, seeing you as not a "flight risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### [[effects_of_accepting_a_counteroffer_on_career_prospects | Effects of Accepting a Counteroffer on Career Prospects]]
Even with a promised promotion or expanded responsibilities, your long-term career prospects can be negatively affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Senior leaders may perceive you as less dedicated and pass you over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Often, the promised role is simply to keep you happy temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Even if you get a new boss, you'll still be working alongside the old boss whom you effectively threatened to quit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Not six months later, the candidate called, admitting the recruiter was right and it "was a big mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

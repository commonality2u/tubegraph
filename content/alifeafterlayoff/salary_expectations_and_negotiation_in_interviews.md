Understanding how recruiters approach [[salary_expectations_and_negotiations | salary expectations and negotiation]] during job interviews can provide a significant advantage in securing a dream job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This insider information, specifically geared towards interactions with internal corporate recruiters, can help candidates better [[strategies_for_handling_salary_discussions_during_job_interviews | handle salary discussions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Recruiter's Approach to Compensation Expectations

A corporate recruiter will typically ask about a candidate's compensation expectation towards the end of an interview if they believe the candidate is a potential fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### When Compensation Isn't Discussed
If a recruiter *does not* ask about your compensation expectation, it almost certainly means you are in their "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. At that point, the recruiter has likely determined you are not a fit, rendering your [[understanding_job_expectations_and_compensation | compensation expectations]] irrelevant as the process will not advance to that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### When Compensation Is Discussed
If a recruiter *does* ask about your [[salary_expectations_and_negotiations | salary expectation]] and it's slightly higher than their allocated range, they will usually inform you of the role's salary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. They might then ask if you would still be open to the position despite the lower range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. It's important to answer honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Addressing Significant Discrepancies
If your [[salary_negotiations_and_market_surveys | salary expectation]] is more than $10,000 or $15,000 apart from the company's range, the recruiter will likely communicate that the position's scope is lower than you anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. They may indicate they'll contact you for a "more enriched role," which is a polite way of saying the company cannot afford you for the current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Candidate Stance on Salary
It is often not advisable to pursue a position that is drastically below your [[salary_expectations_and_negotiations | compensation expectation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Candidates should [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_interviews | stand firm]] in their realistic [[salary_negotiation_strategies | salary requirements]] and ensure they are supported by solid data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. [[how_to_prepare_for_salary_discussions_in_interviews | Preparing for salary discussions]] with market data is key.

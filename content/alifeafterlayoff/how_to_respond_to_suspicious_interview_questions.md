When navigating the job market, candidates often encounter employers who ask suspicious questions during interviews. These questions can serve as [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags]] that indicate a potentially low-quality employer or a problematic company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. Paying close attention to these "tells" can help job seekers discern whether an opportunity is truly suitable for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## General Approach to Suspicious Questions

If an interviewer asks questions that seem off-putting or slightly off-center, it's crucial to listen carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Such questions might signal that the employer is low-quality, and withdrawing candidacy could save future headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Specific Red Flag Questions and How to Handle Them

The following are examples of questions that may indicate a deeper cultural issue or an employer's negative biases:

### 1. Unplanned Absences in the Past Year
*   **The Question**: "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>
*   **The Red Flag**: This question, often asked of hourly employees, suggests the employer is highly focused on attendance, likely due to past issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It indicates an overly particular stance on attendance policies and a potentially inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. It also implies they anticipate you might be an attendance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Response**: Put the question back on the interviewer. Ask what their expectations are regarding unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. If they express a strict stance, it's likely a sign of a toxic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### 2. Minimum Acceptable Salary
*   **The Question**: "What's your minimum acceptable salary?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>
*   **The Red Flag**: This question flat-out asks how cheaply they can acquire you, indicating a lack of flexibility in compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. If an employer is already trying to lowball you at the outset, it suggests future struggles with raises and promotions, making it difficult to maintain a competitive salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### 3. Commitment to Staying in the Role for Two Years
*   **The Question**: "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>
*   **The Red Flag**: This question is a strong indicator of a turnover issue within the company or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. It suggests people are leaving quickly, and the question is based on a bias or a larger cultural problem rather than predicting job success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### 4. Previous Firings
*   **The Question**: "Have you ever been fired?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>
*   **The Red Flag**: This personal question is generally not the employer's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Past employment decisions do not always predict future performance, as a bad situation might not reflect on an individual's overall capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Response**: Redirect the question to focus on future performance and accomplishments in past roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. If the interviewer continues to probe or expresses discomfort, consider withdrawing your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### 5. Accusations of Resume Exaggeration
*   **The Scenario**: An interviewer accuses you of exaggerating or embellishing any part of your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **The Red Flag**: Assuming you haven't embellished your resume, this accusation signals a lack of trust from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. It indicates that the employer either thinks you are lying or assumes all candidates lie, pointing to a toxic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### 6. Biggest Failure
*   **The Question**: "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>
*   **The Red Flag**: This is considered a [[trap_interview_questions | trap question]] that offers little insight beyond potentially using your answer against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. While the intent might be to assess how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase such a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Focusing on failures can lead to bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Response**: If you choose to answer, spend minimal time on the failure itself. Instead, focus on how you overcame the adversity and turned it into a positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### 7. Availability for Off-Shifts/Weekends or On-Site for Remote Roles
*   **The Question**: Asking for availability on off-shifts or weekends for a fixed-shift role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, or about availability to come on-site for a remote job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   **The Red Flag**: This indicates a high likelihood of unexpected overtime or a lack of work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. For remote roles, it suggests the position is not truly remote but hybrid, with a high chance it will eventually become 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Response**: Push back to get clear expectations regarding actual work hours or on-site requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### 8. Dealing with Rude Co-workers or Managers
*   **The Question**: "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>
*   **The Red Flag**: This question immediately suggests that you will be working with difficult or rude colleagues, or even worse, a rude manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This is a strong indicator of a significant cultural issue within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

### 9. Lack of Opportunity for Candidate Questions
*   **The Scenario**: The interviewer dominates the conversation and does not provide an opportunity for you to ask your own questions at the end of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **The Red Flag**: This is a major [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] because an interview is a two-way street; candidates should also be assessing the company and interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. If an employer takes offense to you asking questions, it indicates they feel they are "above" being assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Action**: Be prepared with [[formulating_questions_to_ask_interviewers | questions to ask interviewers]] to assess the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. If the opportunity is not given, or if they react negatively to your questions, it signals a potentially undesirable company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While one or two of these suspicious questions alone might not signify a poor-quality company, they serve as crucial data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. It is important to ask probing questions to understand the underlying issues before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

When recruiters ask about [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectations]] during an interview, it's a crucial question for both the candidate and the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>. Answering incorrectly can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, as can refusing to answer at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Employer's Perspective on Salary Expectations

Recruiters legitimately want to know a candidate's [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectation]] to see if it aligns with the company's established [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary band]] for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. This information is included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The goal is to ensure that if an offer is extended, the candidate will not only accept but also be excited, feeling they received a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

If a candidate accepts a salary below their expectation, they are likely to be unsatisfied and seek other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Employers, especially those seeking to fill positions for the long term, want to avoid having to refill the role within six months to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. While some low-quality employers might try to lowball an offer, reputable employers aim for a mutually beneficial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## How Salary Expectations Impact Candidacy

### Candidate's Salary Higher Than the Range
If a candidate's [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectation]] is too high for the role, they might be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

*   **Minor Discrepancy:** If the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000), some [[salary_negotiation_tactics_by_hr | negotiation]] might occur before further interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Recruiters might gauge flexibility by presenting hypothetical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Significant Discrepancy:** A difference of $25,000 or more realistically means an offer might not make sense, and the recruiter will likely suggest keeping the candidate in mind for a more "enriched" future role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidates:** For exceptionally talented candidates, a recruiter might still send their resume with the accurate [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectation]] to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. In some cases, the hiring manager might then "enrich" the role to a higher level (e.g., Level 2 or 3) to open up wider [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary ranges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. However, this is an exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Candidates should be honest with their expectations and avoid "bait and switch" tactics, as this will not work well with employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### Candidate's Salary Lower Than the Range
If a candidate's [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | compensation expectation]] is below the lowest point of the company's [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary band]], they will automatically be bumped up to that minimum point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This often occurs when a candidate comes from a less reputable or smaller company without defined [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary bands]], or when stepping into a next-level role with a significant gap from their previous salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Finding a high-quality employer can help ensure your pay is consistent with market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

### Refusing to Answer the Question
Refusing to give a clear answer by being vague or beating around the bush will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Recruiters need to know if a deal can be made before putting a candidate through the full interview process with their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Such ambiguity might also lead the recruiter to suspect the candidate is hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## Understanding Employer Salary Bands and Internal Equity

Major corporations utilize **[[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary bands]]**, which define the minimum, midpoint, and maximum compensation for a given role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. These bands are typically based on local market wage surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

Another key concept is **internal equity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Internal equity ensures that individuals within the organization holding similar roles are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This prevents situations where a new entry-level person earns significantly more than an experienced employee in a similar role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Talent acquisition and HR departments collaborate to determine a reasonable [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary range]] for each role based on these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## How to Answer the Salary Question

To effectively answer the [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectation]] question, you need to know three major things:

1.  **Average market salary range:** Research the average salary for similar roles in your local area using resources like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Ensure your [[researching_competitive_salary_ranges_for_roles | research is realistic]] and specific to your geographic location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
2.  **What the company expects to pay:** While you won't know this exactly, having an idea from your [[researching_competitive_salary_ranges_for_roles | market research]] can help you align.
3.  **Your bottom line salary expectation:** This is the absolute minimum salary you can accept, which helps you know when to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. You don't necessarily share this number, but you need to know it for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

### Strategies for Answering:

1.  **Give your expectation directly:** If you are confident in your worth and believe the company is in a similar ballpark, state your actual number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Be prepared to work with this number throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Frame it with market research:** If you suspect a lowball offer or your expectations are significantly higher, put the onus back on the company by stating your [[researching_competitive_salary_ranges_for_roles | market research]]:
    > "From the [[researching_competitive_salary_ranges_for_roles | research]] that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110 thousand. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>
3.  **Put the question back on the recruiter:** If you are worried about pricing yourself out but are interested in the opportunity, ask the recruiter for their range:
    > "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | compensation]]. I understand that companies have [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary bands]] that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>

> üí° **Tip:** While recruiters might push back, always have an answer prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Avoiding the question or being ambiguous won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. If the recruiter shows frustration, provide an answer to avoid being put into the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. Attempting to be ambiguous until the offer stage to negotiate rarely works out well and can annoy the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

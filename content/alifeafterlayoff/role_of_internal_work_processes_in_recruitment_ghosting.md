[[reasons_for_employment_ghosting | Employment ghosting]] occurs when an employer or company representative moves a candidate into a formalized interviewing process but then fails to follow up on the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. This is considered poor [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. Several internal work processes contribute to this issue.

## Impact of Internal Work Processes on Ghosting

### Bad Work Processes
Companies lacking strong internal control often struggle with [[recruitment_process_failures | recruitment process failures]] that lead to ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:27">[03:39:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Formalized Talent Acquisition Department** Organizations without a dedicated talent acquisition department within their human resources typically experience more ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:09">[04:50:09]</a>. When human resources personnel, rather than talent acquisition professionals, manage recruitment, best practices are often not formalized, leading to a poorer [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>.
*   **Poor Technology/Software** If a company uses inadequate technology that cannot properly manage the volume of applicants, an increase in ghosting is likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:18">[05:17:18]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
Recruiters dealing with an excessive number of requisitions (reqs) are prone to letting candidates "fall through the cracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:02">[06:15:02]</a>.
*   **Ideal vs. Overloaded Requisition Loads** A professional recruiter should ideally manage between 15 to 25 requisitions, depending on the industry and role complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:07">[05:31:07]</a>. However, some organizations burden recruiters with 40 to 50 requisitions, effectively doubling a reasonable workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:07">[05:48:07]</a>.
*   **Impact on Candidate Management** With a requirement to submit multiple interviewable candidates per job, an overloaded recruiter might be dealing with 200 or more candidates simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>. This volume makes it difficult to maintain communication and prevent ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:06">[06:12:06]</a>.
*   **Simply Forgetting** In such high-volume environments, a recruiter might simply forget to follow up with a candidate, especially without proper tools or processes to track all candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:08">[06:38:08]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness and Delays
Hiring managers play a significant role in causing perceived or actual ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:02">[06:48:02]</a>.
*   **Delay in Decision Making** Hiring managers may hold onto candidate applications for extended periods, deliberating their fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:08">[07:08:08]</a>.
*   **Requesting More Candidates** Often, they might request to see additional candidates even after interviewing strong ones, causing significant delays in the [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | hiring process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:04">[07:16:04]</a>. A delay of two to four weeks can make it seem like a candidate has been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:09">[07:31:09]</a>. Recruiters often push back on such requests to ensure timely disposition of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:04">[07:47:04]</a>.
*   **Failure to Meet Communication Deadlines** Hiring managers may not adhere to their own promises of responding to recruiters within 24 to 48 hours after a candidate submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:01">[08:08:01]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Internal business decisions can abruptly halt a [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | recruitment process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:03">[08:18:03]</a>.
*   **Mid-Process Changes** A position might be placed on hold or re-scoped even with candidates actively in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:07">[08:28:07]</a>. While the company may want to keep candidates "lukewarm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:08">[08:43:08]</a>, this means they are looking for other candidates while not making a decision on the current ones, which is a poor [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   **Unclosed Requisitions** When a requisition is simply closed, recruiters do not always go back to disposition all remaining in-process candidates, leading to ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

### Hiring Another Candidate Without Closing Others
Even after a candidate is hired, internal process failures can lead to ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:04">[09:21:04]</a>.
*   **Incomplete Closure** The recruiter may close out the requisition itself without following up with and formally closing out other candidates who were in process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:07">[09:23:07]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or [[impact_of_lazy_recruiters_on_candidate_experience | bad recruiting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:08">[09:28:08]</a>.

## Preventing Ghosting Through Internal Processes

Some organizations prioritize [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] and implement processes to minimize ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>.
*   **Amazon's "Two and Five Promise"** Amazon, for example, holds recruiters accountable to strict metrics related to candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>. They have a "two and five promise":
    *   After a hiring manager phone screen, they commit to getting back to the candidate within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
    *   After an on-site interview loop, they commit to providing feedback within five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.
    This policy forces hiring teams to be efficient and decisive, and recruiters to push for quick answers and turnaround times to meet their metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>. Amazon views interviewing candidates as interacting with potential customers, understanding that a negative experience could impact their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>.

Ultimately, while candidates have limited recourse once ghosted, sending a polite "nudge" to the recruiter can prompt them to provide an update or properly close out the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:02">[09:54:02]</a>.

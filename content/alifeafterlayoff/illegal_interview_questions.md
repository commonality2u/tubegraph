Job seekers should be wary when interviewing, as a poor employer can significantly hinder a career. It is crucial to be selective about job roles and to be able to spot bad jobs and poor employers, ideally even before the interview stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. As a candidate, you should interview the employer as much, if not more, than they interview you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Identifying [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | Red Flags]] in Job Interviews

A key indicator of a potentially bad employer is the presence of [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flags]] during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Asking [[illegal_job_interview_questions | Illegal Questions]]

One of the most obvious [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flags]] is when an interviewer asks [[illegal_job_interview_questions | illegal questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. There are specific questions that are entirely off-limits in an interview setting, primarily those unrelated to your ability to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Discriminatory Questions
> Any question related to race, gender, sex, creed, or color is generally considered discriminatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These questions have no bearing on how well you can perform your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Examples of [[illegal_job_interview_questions | illegal questions]] include:

*   **"Are you planning to start a family?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
    *   This is a discriminatory question because it seeks to determine if the employer will need to pay for maternity or paternity leave, or if they might assume a lack of long-term commitment to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Questions about religion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
    *   For example, asking if you will need time off each day for prayer based on an assumption about your descent is illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Such questions are not job-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **What your last compensation was** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
    *   In many states, it is illegal to ask about a candidate's previous compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The rationale is that you should be paid based on the job's worth and the value you bring, not on what you were previously paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This prevents a low previous salary from unfairly following you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Employer Accountability
> While it is true that many hiring managers have limited interview training, this does not excuse asking [[illegal_job_interview_questions | illegal questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Even if the interviewer is unaware that a question is illegal, it remains inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

If an employer asks any of these [[illegal_job_interview_questions | illegal questions]], it is considered a major [[red_flags_in_an_interview_process | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

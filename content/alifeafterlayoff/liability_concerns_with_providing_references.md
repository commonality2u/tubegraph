When companies are asked to provide references for former employees, there are significant [[Impact of references on the hiring process | liability concerns]] that often influence how much information they are willing to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Human Resources (HR) professionals prioritize limiting a company's exposure to any possible liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Reasons for Reluctance

Larger companies, and even some small to medium-sized ones, are generally reluctant to provide detailed references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This reluctance stems from the potential for legal action if a former employer provides a negative reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

For instance, if a previous boss were to state that a person was "terrible" and should not be hired, that individual could potentially face a lawsuit for slander or other related legal terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The former employee might argue that such a statement blocked them from getting a position and essentially "blacklisted" them, giving them grounds to take action against the former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

> [!INFO] Limiting Exposure
> The role of HR professionals is to limit the company's exposure to any possible liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This principle also extends to feedback given during interviews, where only very generic information is typically provided to avoid liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Company Policies on Providing References

Many large corporations actively instruct their employees, particularly those with direct reports, *not* to give out references directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Instead, all reference requests must be filtered back to the Human Resources department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Information Provided by Large Corporations

When contacted, most large corporations will only provide very limited information about a former employee, often referred to as "name, rank, and serial number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This typically includes:
*   The employee's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Their job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
*   Dates of employment (start and end dates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

### Information Not Provided Due to Liability

To avoid [[Impact of references on the hiring process | liability]], major corporations generally will not disclose:
*   Compensation information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Whether the person is eligible for rehire, as even this can open up liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   The disposition or reason for termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>

This strict adherence to minimal information is to prevent the data from being used against the company if an adverse hiring decision is made regarding the former employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Differences in Company Size

While smaller companies may not be as stringent with their reference check policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, larger companies heavily dictate reference checks by strict HR policies to limit liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

For job seekers, this means that even if there was a challenging past employment situation, major employers are unlikely to give out negative or detailed information about a former employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

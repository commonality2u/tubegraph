Job interviews are challenging, but certain questions from employers can signal a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | low-quality employer]] or an ulterior motive, making the process even more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Paying close attention to these "tells" can help job seekers discern if an opportunity is low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Listening carefully to off-putting or off-center questions can indicate a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic workplace]] that might be better to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Specific Red Flag Questions

Several questions can serve as red flags during an interview:

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
While seemingly innocent, this question often indicates an employer's intense focus on attendance, suggesting they have dealt with past attendance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This implies they will be overly particular about attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. If an employer asks this, it shows they might think you will be an attendance issue and suggests an inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. For most people, the desire is to call off sick without repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. If asked, it's advisable to inquire about their expectations for unplanned absences; if they are "cracking down" on it, it's likely an indicator of a [[toxic_workplace_environment_and_employee_treatment | toxic workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
This question directly asks how cheaply an employer can hire you, suggesting a lack of flexibility in compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If an employer starts by trying to lowball you, it's probable they will continue to nickel and dime you during future raises and promotions, making it difficult to maintain a competitive salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
This question strongly indicates a potential turnover issue within the company, suggesting they struggle to retain employees in the same role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It prompts the job seeker to wonder why people are leaving so quickly, and often points to a larger cultural problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### "Have you ever been fired?"
This is generally not an employer's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. An employer should focus on the job at hand, as past employment status doesn't always predict future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Being fired might have been due to a bad situation, and it shouldn't tarnish a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. If asked, job seekers can redirect the question to focus on future abilities and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Continued probing or resistance to this redirection can be a sign to withdraw candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Accusations of Exaggerating or Embellishing Your Resume
Assuming the resume is accurate, starting a new role with an employer who already distrusts you is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This implies they believe you are lying or assume everyone is lying, which is a sign of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic employer]] and a potentially negative company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
This question is considered a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While it might aim to understand how you overcome adversity, it's poorly phrased and can lead to bias, as an employer may use the answer against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Focusing on successes is generally more productive than dwelling on failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. If answered, the focus should be on how adversity was overcome, rather than the failure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Asking About Availability on Off-Shifts or Weekends (for a specific shift)
Common in hourly roles but also present in salaried positions, this indicates that you will likely be working involuntary overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This is a strong indicator of a poor work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Clarifying expectations for actual work hours is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Asking About Availability to Come On-Site (for a remote job)
If a supposedly remote job requires regular on-site presence, it's actually a hybrid position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If a hybrid job is misrepresented as fully remote, there's a high likelihood it will eventually transition to being 100% in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is a significant red flag for those seeking genuinely remote-first opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
This question immediately raises concerns about the nature of the workplace, suggesting that you may be working with "a-holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If the rudeness applies to managers, it's a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This is a strong indicator of a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | cultural issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Lack of Opportunity to Ask Questions

Beyond specific questions, the absence of an opportunity for the candidate to ask their own questions is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. If the interviewer dominates the conversation and doesn't allow for candidate inquiries, it shows they forget that an interview is a two-way street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Job seekers should be assessing the company and interviewer as much as they are being assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. If an employer takes offense to a candidate asking professional questions, it suggests they believe they are superior and should not be assessed, indicating a potentially undesirable company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

While one or two of these questions alone might not definitively mean a company is poor quality, they serve as important data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These red flags should prompt job seekers to ask further probing questions to fully understand any potential [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | cultural issues]] before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

A former HR professional has compiled a list of common pitfalls people encounter when disclosing information to colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Topics to Avoid Discussing

Certain topics should be avoided to maintain a [[positive_workplace_environment | positive workplace environment]] and protect your career.

### Your Job Search
Avoid telling [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] if you are actively looking for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Word can spread quickly, potentially reaching your boss, senior leaders, or HR, which might expedite your exit from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

*   **Resume Visibility**: Be careful where you upload your resume. If it shows your current company or job, avoid public resume databases like Indeed or setting yourself as "available to work" on LinkedIn, as this can alert your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Negative Opinions About Your Boss
Refrain from speaking negatively about your boss, even if you feel that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. While you might feel you have a [[work_ally | work ally]] or confidant, or if they are also complaining, engaging in such conversations can come back to bite you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The boss often finds out, no matter how careful you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Gossiping About Co-workers
Avoid gossiping about other [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] in your department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Being known as a "gossip" can lead to complaints or managers getting involved, creating unwanted attention for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Your Salary
While salary transparency is generally beneficial, it's not recommended to discuss your specific salary internally with [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

*   **Potential Issues**: If [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] learn they are paid less, it can cause resentment, lead to someone quitting, or result in demands for higher compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This can cause management to distrust you, potentially hindering promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Alternative**: Share salary information anonymously on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind to help others understand fair compensation for roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Borrowing Money
Do not borrow money from [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This can create uncomfortable situations and often ends poorly, potentially leading to HR complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Complimenting Physical Attributes
Avoid complimenting [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] on their physical attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Even if your intent is innocent, the recipient's perception is what matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While a general compliment like "That hairdo looks great on you" might be acceptable, keep it [[professional_communication_in_interviews | professional]] and avoid anything that could be interpreted as "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Speculating About Pregnancy
Never call out or ask about a perceived pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Either the person is not ready to disclose it, or they are not pregnant, leading to an offensive situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Let the individual take the lead on disclosing such personal news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Discussing Potential Litigation Against the Company
If you are involved in or planning a lawsuit against the company, do not discuss it with [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Revealing details could allow the company to take proactive measures to defend itself, putting your job at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This information should only be shared with your attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Off-Color Jokes
Avoid telling off-color jokes in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. A joke you consider innocent might be offensive to the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The impact of the joke on the receiver is what matters, not your intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Stick to "dumb dad jokes" or avoid jokes altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Politics
In today's modern workplace, it's best to avoid discussing anything political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Political discussions are often hot-button issues that can offend or lead to arguments, regardless of your stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. To protect your career and avoid legal trouble, treat [[navigating_coworker_relationships | co-workers]] with a high degree of [[professional_communication_in_interviews | professionalism]] and be careful about what you disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

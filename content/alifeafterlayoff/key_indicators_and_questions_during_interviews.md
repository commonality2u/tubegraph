This guide, based on insights from a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, reveals what recruiters say versus what they actually mean in job interviews. It provides an insider's advantage to help candidates navigate the process successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Types of Recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

It's important to distinguish between two main types of recruiters:

### Head Hunters (External) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   **Role:** Third-party contractors hired by a company to fill a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Compensation:** Paid on contingency, typically 15-25% of the hired candidate's first-year income if they successfully place someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Knowledge:** Generally have a lower level of knowledge about the specific role compared to internal recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Corporate Recruiters (Internal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   **Role:** Full-time employees of the company, part of a talent acquisition or HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Compensation:** Paid a salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Focus:** Aim to place the best possible talent and fit for their hiring managers, as this is their key metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Knowledge:** Support specific functional groups and work repeatedly with the same hiring managers, building strong relationships and deep alignment on position requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Interview Focus:** The first interview with a corporate recruiter is usually a screening to assess baseline competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The insider information provided is specifically for the internal recruiter's interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Key Indicators and Questions During Interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

### "What do you know about the company?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **What it means:** This question is asked early in the interview to gauge your [[interview_questions_preparation | level of interest]] and potential engagement in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Red flag:** Walking in without understanding what the company does or what the position entails is a significant negative indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Action:** Always come prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Asking About Specific Skills or Experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   **What it means:** These are baseline competencies and absolute requirements for the position that the hiring manager needs to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Red flag:** If you lack a specific skill or experience, it's likely you won't move to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Nuance:** In some cases, if you bring other strong attributes, you might still be considered, but it's not a guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Recruiter Repeats or Rephrases Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   **What it means:** You are likely missing the point of the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Each question is carefully crafted to assess a particular competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Action:** Stop, listen carefully, and recalibrate your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Tip:** It's acceptable to ask for clarification, "Can you please give me an idea of what it is that you're looking for?" to provide a better-tailored answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Rambling Answers Without Follow-up Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   **What it means:** If you ramble without pause and the interviewer doesn't ask follow-up questions, you're almost certainly being moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Why:** Long-windedness is considered the "kiss of death" in interviews because it indicates an inability to effectively communicate and influence senior leaders in a business setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Action:** Answer directly and concisely, allowing the interviewer to probe for more information if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This relates to [[star_methodology_for_interviews | effective communication]].

### Not Being Asked About Compensation Expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
*   **What it means:** If a recruiter doesn't ask about your compensation expectations, it's a strong [[successful_job_interview_indicators | indicator]] that you've already been determined not to be a fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Conversely:** If they *do* ask, it means they see you as a potential fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Salary Mismatch:** If your expectation is slightly higher, they might ask if you're open to their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. If you're more than $10,000-$15,000 apart, they might say the role is "scoped lower" and they'll call you for a "more enriched role" â€“ this means they can't afford you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Action:** Stand firm on your realistic requirements and be armed with good data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### "Do you have any questions for me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   **What it means:** At this point, the interviewer has likely already decided whether you'll move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. No amount of selling will change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** This question is more a formality, providing you a chance to gather information to make an informed decision about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Action:** This is an opportunity for [[asking_questions_to_interviewers | essential questions to ask during an interview]] to assess mutual fit.

### Recruiter Actively "Sells" the Job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   **What it means:** If the recruiter tries to sell you the job and get you excited, it's a strong [[successful_job_interview_indicators | indicator]] that they see you as a potentially great fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Next step:** They are likely going to send you to the hiring manager and are already pre-selling you for a potential offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Short Interview (10-15 Minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
*   **What it means:** If the interview wraps up quickly, you're likely not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Recruiters often know within 5-7 minutes if a candidate is a decent fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Action:** Make your best first impression and "come out of the gate strong" to pass the first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### "We've had a lot of interest... we'll be back to you after all interviews are completed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   **What it means:** This phrasing usually means you are not moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Positive sign:** If you are a good candidate, they will try to pre-sell you and introduce you to the hiring manager, potentially scheduling a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This is a very strong sign of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

By understanding these cues, you can better interpret recruiter communication and position yourself for success in your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

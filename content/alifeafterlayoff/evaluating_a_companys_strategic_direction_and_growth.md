When considering a job opportunity, it's crucial to evaluate the strategic direction and growth potential of the organization. This assessment helps ensure stability and alignment with your career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Signs of Company Growth

One positive indicator of a company's growth is if a position is open due to an added headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This suggests the department or company is expanding, which is generally a good sign for stability and future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Assessing Strategic Direction

It is critical to join an organization with clear strategic direction that you believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. You also want to ensure there is longevity and stability in the position, avoiding situations where the company is on "shaky ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Key Questions to Ask

To understand a company's strategic direction, consider asking the following questions during your interview:

*   **Addressing Competitor Innovations:** Perform homework before the interview to identify the company's biggest competitors and any industry-shaking new technologies they've released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Then, ask the interviewer: "I noticed that one of your competitors came out with a really intriguing new product, process, or idea. How is this company planning to address that and stay in front of the market?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. A respectable company should be aware of competitors and have a strategic direction to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This question can also contribute to [[evaluating_a_companys_reputation | evaluating a company's reputation]].
*   **Concerns Keeping Them Up at Night:** Ask the hiring manager: "If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The answer can provide valuable insight into what is truly happening "behind the scenes" at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Red Flags

If a company or interviewer cannot articulate their strategic direction or is unaware of major competitor moves, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This should prompt you to ask more questions and potentially reconsider the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

By proactively asking these types of questions, you can gain a deeper understanding of the company's future outlook and make an informed decision about whether the role aligns with your [[importance_of_strategic_career_planning | strategic career planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Remember, you should be [[career_planning_and_job_market_strategy | interviewing the company]] just as much as they are interviewing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

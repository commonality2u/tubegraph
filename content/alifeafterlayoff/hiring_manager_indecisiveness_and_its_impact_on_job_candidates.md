Hiring manager indecisiveness is one of the most common situations that can lead to the perception of a job candidate being [[Impact of the hiring process on job seekers – Link name: impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | ghosted]], even if they haven't been definitively rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This issue often creates frustration for both job seekers and recruiters alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## How Indecisiveness Occurs

When a recruiter sends a candidate to a hiring manager, the manager might "sit on" the application for an extended period, "hemming and hawing" about whether the candidate is a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Another common scenario is when the hiring manager expresses interest but requests to see "two or three additional candidates" before making a decision to bring anyone in for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Impact on Job Candidates

*   **Perceived Ghosting** This behavior can cause significant [[reasons_for_delays_in_job_offer_process | delays in the hiring process]], potentially extending it by two, three, or even four weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. For a candidate who was submitted early in the process, these delays can make it appear as though they have been [[Impact of the hiring process on job seekers – Link name: impact_of the hiring process on job seekers | ghosted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **"Lukewarm" Status** Hiring managers may also request that recruiters keep candidates "lukewarm," meaning they want to continue looking for other candidates while keeping the current candidate "on the side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This essentially communicates that the company "kind of like[s] you but we don't like you enough to make a decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Recruiter's Role and Pushback

From a recruiter's perspective, hearing a hiring manager ask for more candidates after submitting suitable ones is "one of the worst things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Professional recruiters will often push back against wishy-washy hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. They argue that if a manager is indecisive about a candidate, it's a clear indication that the person isn't the right fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Recruiters aim to compel hiring managers to make a decision and "disposition" the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The potential reality of losing a "potentially decent candidate" can often be enough to prompt a hiring manager to make a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This proactive approach helps maintain a better [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

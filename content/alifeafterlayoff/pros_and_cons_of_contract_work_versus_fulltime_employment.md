## Introduction and Perceptions

When facing a job search, individuals might consider contract work as an alternative to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many job seekers tend to avoid contract positions, viewing them as lower quality and carrying a [[stigma_and_perception_of_contract_positions | stigma]] of not being a "full-time" or permanent role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, recruiters often view contracting differently, and understanding this perspective can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Advantages of Contract Work

*   **Higher Availability** In uncertain markets, such as during a pandemic, companies may be apprehensive about adding permanent headcount but still need work done. This leads to more contract positions being readily available compared to full-time roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. There is a higher likelihood of being considered for a contract position due to their prevalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Opportunity to Demonstrate Skills and Reduce Employer Risk** Contract positions offer a chance to prove capabilities, especially if an employer views a candidate as a "stretch" for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For hiring managers, contracts reduce the risk associated with a new hire, as they don't have to "live with the headcount" if the hiring decision proves poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Some contract roles are intentionally created to allow candidates to prove themselves, with the potential for conversion to full-time if they perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Asking about the likelihood of conversion during an interview is a good strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **[[contract_positions_for_skill_development_and_industry_transition | Skill Development and Industry Transition]]** Contract work can be a strategic way to [[contract_roles_as_a_strategic_career_move | pivot into a new industry]], job type, or gain new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It allows individuals to acquire experience in a new field, such as healthcare, making their resume more relevant to that industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This is a highly strategic method for filling resume gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Income Continuation** A contract position can bridge the financial gap during a typical job search, which can last six to nine months, or even up to a year in some markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This allows individuals to maintain income while continuing to seek a perfect full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **"Test Drive" the Company** Just as companies can test an employee, an employee can "test drive" the company, the work environment, co-workers, and even the boss. If the situation is unfavorable, it's easier to leave a contract role than a permanent one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Confidence Boost After Layoff** For those who have experienced a layoff, a contract position can help boost confidence, facilitate healing, and re-establish a work routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It is generally easier to find a job when already employed and receiving a steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Potentially Higher Hourly Pay** In many cases, contract positions can offer a higher hourly rate compared to full-time roles, potentially allowing individuals to earn significantly more over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Some individuals earn enough from contracts to take extended breaks between assignments and still maintain financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Contract Work

*   **Risk of a [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_job_hopping | Hopping Resume]]** Repeatedly taking short-term contract positions can make a resume appear as if the individual frequently changes jobs. Hiring managers often prefer candidates with a demonstrated commitment to long-term projects and stable relationships within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This can be a significant bias or misconception to overcome, particularly for younger professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[job_security_and_benefits_in_contract_versus_fulltime_roles | Benefits]]** In most cases, contract positions do not offer the same comprehensive [[job_security_and_benefits_in_contract_versus_fulltime_roles | benefits]] packages (e.g., medical, retirement) that large corporations provide to their full-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. While some agencies may offer benefits, they are usually inferior to those for full-time corporate roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Sense of Limbo and Instability** Being on a contract can create a feeling of limbo, where one's life is put on pause, especially if transitioning from a full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. There is a continuous need to look for the next position and plan for the contract's end, which can be challenging when considering major life events like buying a house or having children that require stable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Lack of Employer Commitment and Loyalty** Contractors are aware that the employer is not fully committed to them. There are typically no long-term career opportunities within the company, beyond a potential conversion to full-time, and there's a perceived lack of loyalty from the employer's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Not Feeling Part of the Team** Contract employees may not feel fully integrated into the team, as discussions about future projects or long-term company forecasts often come with the unspoken understanding that a contractor may not be there to see them through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Weighing Your Options

Deciding between a contract and a full-time position requires carefully weighing these pros and cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The best choice depends on personal preference, the current job market, and the frequency of job opportunities available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. For some, contracting makes significant sense, particularly in difficult job searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

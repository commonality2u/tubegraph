The concept of "quiet quitting" has emerged as a significant development in the workforce, seen as an extension of the "Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This phenomenon, which gained traction on platforms like TikTok, highlights a fundamental shift in employee attitudes towards work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that he is not advocating for quiet quitting, but rather exploring it as a legitimate phenomenon discussed in publications like Business Insider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?
Quiet quitting is defined as "effectively quitting your job without quitting your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It involves reducing output to the minimum acceptable standard required for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Employees doing this are doing "just enough to get by," avoiding extra tasks or burdens, and relieving themselves of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Rise of "Coasting Culture"
This behavior marks a shift from the previous "hustle culture" to a "coasting culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Employee Perspective
> During the pandemic, many professionals began to view work as "just that â€” work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For the first time in their lives, jobs became primarily "a source of a paycheck to support themselves and their families and not a higher calling that demands their utmost devotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, according to a Business Insider article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

The pandemic created ideal conditions for this new resolve:
*   **Hot Labor Market:** Ensured job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_remote_work | Rise of Remote Work]]:** Made it harder for managers to monitor employee effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

While some might label these employees as "lazy" or "unambitious," the employees themselves see it as a "considered, deliberate decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. They are "done letting companies squeeze free labor out of them" after years of feeling exploited by demands for late nights, lost weekends, and absolute loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This represents a "secret resistance against the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## The Pendulum Swing in Employment Dynamics
Historically, the employment market pendulum was "buried on the employer side of things," with companies demanding extensive commitment and using employees as "resources to exploit" for maximum productivity at minimum cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This led to a "hustle culture" where employees felt compelled to work long hours, take on extra work, and remain accessible outside of business hours, even missing family events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Cycle of Layoffs
> Companies traditionally operated in cycles: starting lean, becoming bloated over about a decade, and then undergoing [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | reductions in force or layoffs]] during "catastrophic events" like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Leading up to 2020, there was an "extended growth period" where companies became bloated and seemed to be "looking for any excuse to cut the fat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

The pandemic in 2020 provided "a very opportune time" for companies to make "ruthless cuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. However, many companies "cut too big, too deep," which "fractured the workforce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. When demand "came screaming back" suddenly, these companies found that their actions backfired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Employees who had participated in the "hustle culture" and lost years of their lives to work "suddenly found a deep sense of betrayal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This period is seen as a "seismic shift in the workplace," where employees are now re-evaluating everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## New Employee Mindset and the Future of Work
This shift is compounded by a generational component, as Baby Boomers exit the workforce and Gen Z enters with a "completely different" mentality towards the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

> [!INFO] Impact on Companies
> Companies will be "forced to re-evaluate how they approach the work world and how they treat their employees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The speaker notes that the days of being loyal to a company for 20 years are "gone" and "almost become antiquated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Staying long-term without frequent promotions can lead to falling "behind the employment curve" and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The pendulum has now swung towards the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, with many participating in or extending the "Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. They are no longer willing to work long hours or weekends and are "finally establishing employment boundaries in their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This is considered a "healthy thing" as "employers behaving badly got away with it" for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Employees are prioritizing "work to live" over "live to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, shedding old expectations that required grueling hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The era of "leaning in" for decades is giving way to "leaning back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

The speaker advises unhappy employees to "take a long hard look at your work situation" and "strategically plan your exit" by keeping resumes updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. However, for those with built-up equity or who don't want to quit, quiet quitting by reducing work to the "minimum acceptable output" is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Employers, unable to easily backfill positions, often view "some output is better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

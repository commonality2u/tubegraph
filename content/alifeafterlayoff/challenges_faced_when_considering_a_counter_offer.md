When faced with an offer for a new position, informing your current employer often leads to them scrambling to present a counter offer, promising a new title and bigger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience strongly advises against accepting a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> Considering a counter offer can be a stressful situation.

## Statistics on Accepting Counter Offers

According to LinkedIn, an overwhelming majority of people who accept counter offers do not remain with their current company for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   80% or more of people who accept counters won't be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   93% won't be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

This data suggests that accepting a counter offer rarely leads to long-term satisfaction or stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## [[Reasons to avoid accepting a counter offer]]

The primary reason to decline a counter offer is that the original reasons for seeking a new job typically persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If you were unhappy at work due to issues such as:
*   Feeling underappreciated or underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   Being passed up for a deserved promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Feeling completely overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Having a bad boss or working with one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Poor company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Work-life balance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   A difficult commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Terrible benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

These underlying issues will likely remain unresolved even after a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. If you've reached the point of considering another offer, it's typically for a good reason, and it's essential to keep your options open and be "selfish" with your career, as no one else will look out for your best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Leaving a bad boss, poor work culture, or a dying industry is not just the right thing, but the smart thing to do for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## [[Potential risks associated with accepting a counter offer]]

Several significant risks and challenges arise when you accept a counter offer:

### Employer's Motivation and Trust
*   **Undervaluing You:** A key question to ask is why your employer is only countering now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. They were essentially undervaluing you until you threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Buying Time:** By dangling a counter offer, they might be buying themselves time to find your replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Relationship Damage:** Your relationships with colleagues and senior leaders may not be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Your boss will know they need a contingency plan for your role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Impact on Career Progression
*   **Labeled as Disloyal:** Having broadcast your intention to leave, you may be labeled as someone not long-term committed to the business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Layoff Risk:** When the company faces financial difficulties, employees who have previously shown dissatisfaction, especially if they now have a higher salary, may be among the first considered for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Stunted Advancement:** Senior leaders might view you as less dedicated and pass you over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The promotion promised in a counter offer might merely be a short-term measure to keep you happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **"Locked In" Role:** If you were effective at your job but passed over for promotion, accepting a counter offer might keep you locked into that specific role, as your boss doesn't want to lose your immediate contribution there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Persistence of Workplace Conditions
Even if there's a temporary "honeymoon period" after accepting a counter offer, the old workplace issues will eventually resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The business environment, including stability concerns, is unlikely to change significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Even if you're promoted to a new role with a new boss, you'll still be working alongside the old boss whom you effectively threatened to quit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker shares a firsthand account of a candidate who accepted a counter offer, turned their moving truck around, and regretted the decision within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Accepting a counter offer is often compared to an old relationship: look back fondly, but remember that it ended for a reason, and look forward to new beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Your career will likely benefit from embracing new opportunities rather than returning to a situation you were already seeking to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

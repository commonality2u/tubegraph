A significant red flag to consider when evaluating a job offer is if the proposed [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary]] or [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | benefits]] package appears inadequate or "off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Even after being upfront and realistic about your [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary expectation]] throughout the interview process, a lowball offer or an uncompetitive benefits package can indicate a poor-quality company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Salary Considerations

### Lowball Offers
If a company presents a lowball offer, or an offer that is uncompetitive relative to your [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | salary expectation]], it suggests a company of poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. If a company is simply capped at what they can afford and has led you through an extensive interviewing process, they have effectively wasted both your time and theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Knowing Your Worth
It is crucial to understand your market value and what you believe you are worth, and to stand firm on that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Ensure you are equipped with valid data to support your worth and seek out high-quality employers who are willing to pay you what you deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. There are methods to [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | negotiate higher salaries]], but it's important to recognize when a company's offer is fundamentally misaligned with your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Benefits Package Assessment

### Lack of Flexibility
When it comes to benefits, there is typically minimal room for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. A standard benefits program across a large corporation cannot usually be renegotiated, and exceptions for individuals are rarely made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Declining Benefits
It is essential to carefully review the company's [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | benefits package]] to ensure it is competitive within the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. If you examine company reviews and observe a trend of benefits worsening year over year, this indicates that the company is not adequately investing in its employees, serving as another significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Even after navigating the demanding corporate hiring process and receiving an offer, it can be deflating if the offer is underwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. It is crucial to assess the company with the same scrutiny they apply to you, treating yourself as a "free agent in the open market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

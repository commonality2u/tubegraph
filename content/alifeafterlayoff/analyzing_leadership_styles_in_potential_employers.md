When interviewing for a new role, it's crucial to screen the hiring manager and the company as much as they are screening you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience notes that the best candidates often interview the company more than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This proactive approach helps candidates be selective about the roles they accept, as a bad job can set one back years in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Asking insightful questions not only shows engagement to the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> but also allows you to gather essential data to make an informed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Key Questions to Ask a Hiring Manager

Here are critical questions to ask your potential hiring manager to help [[assessing_potential_issues_with_a_new_boss_or_manager|vet your boss]] and understand their leadership style and the departmental dynamic:

### 1. Why is this position open? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
This question provides insight into the department's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **If the previous person was terminated, laid off, or quit:** This suggests potential issues behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   If they quit, ask *why* to understand if the work was dissatisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   If terminated, ask *why* and what they were not successful in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **If it's an added headcount:** This is generally a good sign, indicating department or company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### 2. What is your vision for this role? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
Understanding the hiring manager's long-term vision for the position and why it was created helps you tailor your interview answers to align with their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 3. What's one weakness that you currently have in your department? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
This question helps identify areas where your skills might [[linking_past_experiences_to_a_potential_employers_needs|align]] and contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. You can also ask about strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### 4. How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
This allows you to assess if your capabilities align with their expectations for the role's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### 5. How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
It's vital to ensure that expectations are reasonable and achievable for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If the hiring manager's expectations seem unrealistic, it could be an [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews|employer red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, indicating potential [[assessing_company_culture_during_interviews|cultural fit]] issues that could lead to early turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### 6. What is it about the person previously in this role that made them so successful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
If the previous person was promoted or moved on, their success can provide a roadmap for how you can also succeed in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### 7. Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
While it's important to show interest in the immediate role, it's reasonable to inquire about long-term career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This ensures the role isn't a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 8. What would you describe your leadership style as? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
It's crucial to [[assessing_potential_issues_with_a_new_boss_or_manager|vet your boss]] to ensure alignment with their leadership style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. A more fun way to ask this is: "If I was to go out into your department and ask some of your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> This question can reveal the manager's self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> and helps you understand the type of boss you'll be working for to determine if it's a good [[assessing_company_culture_during_interviews|fit for your career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### 9. How is this company planning to address competitive developments and stay in front of the market? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
Before the interview, research the company's biggest competitors and any significant industry shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This question assesses the organization's strategic direction and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. A lack of strategic direction or a direction you don't believe in could be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. If they don't have a plan, it's a [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews|red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### 10. If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
This "fun" question offers genuine insight into what's truly on the hiring manager's mind and what's happening behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

By asking these questions throughout the interview process, you can engage in a two-way dialogue, gain critical information, and make an informed decision about whether the opportunity is the right [[evaluating_the_company_and_role_as_a_candidate|fit for you]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

This article highlights some of the most absurd and ridiculous job requirements and postings found online, serving as a lighthearted way to critique employers and help job seekers [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | recognize red flags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The aim is to encourage job seekers to [[challenges_with_unrealistic_job_postings | value themselves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> and avoid applying for "garbage" listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Unreasonable Job Postings and Employer Interactions

Examining various job advertisements and interactions can reveal [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | absurd expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> or [[hidden_job_requirements_in_recruitment | unreasonable demands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> from employers. These examples help job seekers [[how_to_identify_low_quality_job_postings | identify low-quality job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

### Underpaid Accounting Role
An accounting position advertised as remote offered $1,400 per month, which breaks down to $8.75 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
Minimum requirements included:
*   Two years of accounting experience with US-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   A bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   Demonstrated experience, with a preference for property management, trust accounting, and specific software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

This salary, amounting to $16,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, is considered below poverty level and significantly less than the typical entry-level accounting salary of $45,000 to $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It suggests an employer with unrealistic expectations for the compensation offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Employee Handbook Charges
An employee handbook from an assumed restaurant detailed a series of charges deducted from an employee's final pay upon leaving the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. These charges included:
*   Handbook fee ($10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   Training manual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   File processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   Payroll processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   W-2 processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Uniform costs (e.g., $12 for a t-shirt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   Training costs ($25 a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   Hiring processing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>

Such practices are virtually unheard of in the modern workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> and indicate an anti-employee stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, likely stemming from poor management or high turnover in lower-level positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This is a clear indicator of a [[how_to_identify_low_quality_job_postings | low-quality employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Interview Punctuality Rejection
A job applicant was denied a full-time position for arriving exactly on time for an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The recruiter suggested arriving earlier for future interviews to "show an employer that you are keen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. While arriving a few minutes early is often recommended for personal calibration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, rejecting a candidate for punctuality is deemed a ridiculous reason to deny a job opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Unpaid "Test Work" During Interview Process
An employer asked a candidate to "come in and work for a couple of hours to see if you like the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. When the candidate inquired about being paid, the hiring manager replied, "No, not for that day. This is for you to get a feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, then unceremoniously ended the application process, stating, "Don't worry it doesn't look like it's going to work out. Thanks for applying anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

> [00:09:07] "What kind of employer expects people to come in and do work for free and then not question it and if you do question it you're not a good fit you're a cultural issue you're going to be a problem and it's not going to work out."

Candidates should never work for free, even for a "test run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Similarly, providing solutions to a company's actual business problems as part of a case study or presentation for an interview is essentially offering free consulting services and should be avoided unless compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This is a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Unpaid Startup CMO Role
A "legitimate job posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> for a Marketing Manager/Chief Marketing Officer at a startup, `chat Memoir team`, stated:

> [00:13:19] "Please note that initially you will work with the founding team as we secure VC funding on a part-time unpaid basis before coming on board full-time as a on a paid basis once we secure funding."

Working for a startup is not inherently a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, but many are "bootstrap" operations lacking funds and experienced leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. [[The reality of startup job postings | Startup founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, often highly skilled in their technical field, may lack business acumen, people management, or HR experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The absence of a human resources or talent acquisition department can lead to absurd requirements and a "Wild Wild West" approach to hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

This specific posting for an executive-level candidate to work unpaid, with funding as a distant and uncertain prospect, is an "absolute steaming pile of garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. It preys on desperate job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, but candidates with such experience should have self-respect and avoid giving away free intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Excessively Wide Salary Ranges
In states with pay transparency laws (e.g., Colorado, New York City, Connecticut) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, companies are required to publish salary ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Some legitimate companies provide realistic ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. However, one big tech company posted a base salary range of $150,000 to $890,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a> â€“ a spread of $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

This wide range is a "shady" attempt by companies to comply with transparency laws while effectively not disclosing a realistic salary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. It does little for the job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> and reflects a dishonest approach from the employer, which can indicate further dishonesty throughout the hiring process and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Multi-Faceted Labor/Business Development Role
A Canadian job posting for a "website business developer and landscaper" offered $20-25 Canadian dollars an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a> (less in USD). The role required:
*   Website redevelopment and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>
*   Promoting eco-friendly landscape services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>
*   Up to 50% physical labor for landscaping and snow removal in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>

The position, likely for a "mom and pop" urban farming business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, also required candidates to be registered with a Canadian post-secondary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. This contract or part-time role (8-16 weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a> asks for highly diverse and often unrelated skills, indicating a lack of clear role definition and potentially overwhelming responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Overqualified Internship Requirements
A four-month student internship position starting September 2023 sought candidates with:
*   Advanced knowledge of insurance and wealth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>
*   Understanding of advisor compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>
*   Knowledge of internal administrative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>
*   Post-secondary education in a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>
*   Professional designations like CPA, CFA, CSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>
*   Advanced analytical skills with Power BI, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>

These extensive requirements are highly unrealistic for a typical internship, suggesting employers are "expecting the moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. This highlights a skewed perception of reality where employers expect significant experience and certifications for entry-level or temporary roles, often with low or no pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

### The "Fridge Photo" Application Requirement
One job application included a field to attach a resume and also asked for "a photo of the inside of your fridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The criteria for what kind of fridge condition (messy vs. meticulously neat) was valued was unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

This bizarre request is likely either a recruiter attempting to be "cute" or a hiring manager with completely unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. Such arbitrary demands, including lengthy behavioral interview questions on an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, indicate a cumbersome interview process at best and a [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a> at worst.

## Conclusion: Recognizing Red Flags
These examples demonstrate how employers, often lacking proper HR or talent acquisition departments, may post [[challenges_with_unrealistic_job_postings | absurd requirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. While some might be accidental, many are deliberate attempts to exploit job seekers or navigate regulations without true transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

> [00:27:01] "Don't apply for red flag employers. It's not worth it in your career. They will never get you ahead. You'll never get ahead working for a red flag or or a toxic employer. They are low quality employers for a reason and the good news is is that they're literally telling you where local quality employers."

By recognizing these [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, job seekers can avoid wasting time and effort on toxic or low-quality opportunities, ensuring they value themselves appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

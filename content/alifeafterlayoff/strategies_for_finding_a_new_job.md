Recognizing these signs and proactively pursuing new opportunities can significantly improve job search success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Key Indicators It's Time to Seek New Employment

Several common reasons prompt job seekers to leave their current roles. If any of these resonate, it might be time to start looking for a new position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

### 1. Underpayment or Lagging Market Rate
If you feel you are underpaid after doing market research, and others in similar roles are receiving significantly higher compensation, it's a clear sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Market Research:** Easily research current market rates for your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Catching Up:** Incremental raises (2-3% merit or cost of living increases) rarely allow you to catch up if you significantly lag the market, especially with high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For example, tech recruiting salaries have seen massive increases of 30-40% in a competitive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Long Tenure:** If you've been in your role for five years or longer, you will likely be pleasantly surprised by current market compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 2. Constant Overload and Overwork
The "Great Resignation" has led to many people exiting the workforce, and companies struggle to replace talent or cut expenses due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This often results in remaining employees getting stuck with additional workload, where a job that used to take two people is squeezed into one person's productivity, leading to 70-90 hour work weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This is unsustainable and leads to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### 3. Company Financial Instability
Rising inflation and business costs impact companies' ability to backfill roles or offer competitive salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Warning Signs:** Pay attention to indicators such as companies struggling to contain costs or an uptick in layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Proactive Approach:** Do not wait for a layoff to happen; get ahead of it by updating your resume and exploring other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### 4. Sense of Dread for Work / "Sunday Scaries"
If you look forward to weekends with anticipation but experience a strong sense of dread when Monday morning approaches, and find yourself psyching yourself up to go to work, it's a significant indicator that something is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This can suggest you are in the wrong job type, company, or are experiencing burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### 5. Forced Return to Office Without Compelling Reason
For those who have been working remotely, being forced back to the office simply for "facetime" or to utilize expensive office space, without a job-specific necessity, is a valid reason to consider other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Many companies actively recruit from organizations that force return-to-office policies by offering fully remote positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### 6. Quiet Quitting or Lack of Motivation
If you find yourself doing less and less, struggling to find motivation, or producing less work due to burnout, lack of motivation, or lack of passion for the job, it's an unsustainable situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This is often referred to as "quiet quitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### 7. Stagnation and Lack of Upward Mobility
Feeling stagnated, not learning new things, or being blocked from developing your full potential are common reasons for job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. If you've reached your ceiling and there's no upward mobility because senior roles are occupied indefinitely, it's a clear sign to look for a job that allows you to achieve your career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### 8. Toxic Bosses or Co-workers
Working in an unhealthy, toxic environment with a toxic boss or co-workers can negatively impact your mental state, physical wellness, upward mobility, work-life balance, sanity, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. There are many opportunities with better quality employers; it's not worth staying in a toxic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### 9. Declining Health Due to Job
If your job is causing your health to suffer, manifesting as stress, anxiety, sudden weight changes, temperament shifts, sleep cycle disruptions, or requiring medication, it's a critical sign to seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. No promotion is worth sacrificing your health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### 10. Mass Exodus of Co-workers
If many of your co-workers are quitting, it's a strong indicator that something is fundamentally wrong with the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Chances are, they have compelling reasons and may be happier and earning more elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Networking with them to explore opportunities on their new teams can be a good strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

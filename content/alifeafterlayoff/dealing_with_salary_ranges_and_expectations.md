When interviewing for a new role, one of the most anticipated and sometimes dreaded questions is about [[handling_questions_about_salary_expectations | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Answering this question incorrectly can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, as can refusing to answer at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. There is more to [[discussing_salary_expectations | discussing salary expectations]] than simply stating a number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters typically ask about [[role_of_salary_expectations_in_job_offers | salary expectations]] towards the end of an interview, especially if they are interested in moving a candidate to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The primary reason is to determine if your expectations fit within the established salary band for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This information is then included when submitting your profile to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

This is generally not a trick question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Companies genuinely want to understand your [[salary negotiation and expectation management | salary expectations]] to ensure that if an offer is extended, you will not only accept but also be excited about the position, feeling you've received a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. If you accept a salary below your expectations, you are likely to be unsatisfied and keep an eye open for other opportunities, which means the company may have to refill the position within six months to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Therefore, the [[importance_of_salary_expectations_for_both_employer_and_employee | salary question is important for both sides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

If your realistic [[salary negotiation and expectation management | salary expectations]] deter an employer, it's often a good sign, as you likely wouldn't want to work for a company unwilling to pay market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Scenario: Your Salary Expectation is Higher Than the Range

If your [[salary negotiation and expectation management | salary expectation]] is too high for the role, you may be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Small Gap**: If the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000), some negotiation might occur even before further interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. A recruiter might explore your flexibility by presenting hypothetical compensation scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Large Gap**: If the difference is significant (e.g., $25,000), it's unlikely an offer will make sense for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The recruiter might suggest keeping you in mind for a more enriched future role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidate**: In rare cases, for a highly talented "superstar" candidate, a recruiter might still forward your resume with the accurate [[salary negotiation and expectation management | salary expectations]] to the hiring manager, suggesting it might be worth stretching for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This could lead to the role being enriched to a higher level with wider salary ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, this is the exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

It's crucial to be honest with your expectations; trying a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Scenario: Your Salary Expectation is Lower Than the Band

This is a favorable situation for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If your expectation is below the company's lowest point for the role, you will automatically be raised to that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Major corporations use salary bands with minimum, midpoint, and maximum values, often based on local market wage surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Companies also consider "internal equity," ensuring that employees in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Talent acquisition works with HR to define a reasonable salary range for each role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

This scenario is common when a candidate comes from a less reputable or smaller company without defined salary bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, or when stepping into a next-level role with a significant pay gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This highlights the [[importance of knowing baseline and acceptable salary range | importance of finding the best quality employer]] to ensure your compensation is consistent with market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Scenario: Refusing to Answer the Question

Providing a vague or evasive answer when asked about your [[handling_questions_about_salary_expectations | salary expectation]] will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Recruiters need to know they can "get a deal done" before putting you through a full interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Refusing to answer can also make the recruiter suspect you are hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Attempting to be ambiguous and negotiate only at the offer stage rarely works well, as the hiring manager will likely be annoyed if they cannot afford your eventual demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## How to Prepare Your Answer

To [[handling_salary_expectations_and_negotiations_appropriately | handle salary expectation discussions appropriately]], you need to know three key pieces of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:

1.  **Average Salary Range for the Role in the Open Market**:
    *   Conduct research using Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Look at other similar recently posted roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Ensure you compare jobs in your local area, as salary ranges can differ significantly by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **What the Company is Expecting to Pay**: This involves understanding their salary band for the role.
3.  **Your Bottom Line Salary Expectation**: This is the absolute minimum you can accept, the point at which you must walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. While you don't necessarily share this number, it's crucial for your internal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## How to Answer the Question

When it comes to [[handling_salary_discussions_during_interviews | handling salary discussions during interviews]], consider these approaches:

### 1. Directly State Your Expectation

If you are confident in your worth and believe the company is within a similar ballpark, you can simply state your desired number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Remember that this number will be used throughout the hiring process, so ensure it is reasonable and something you can commit to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### 2. Frame Your Expectation with Market Research

If you are concerned the company might lowball you or your expectations are significantly higher than theirs, frame your answer based on your [[researching_salary_ranges_for_roles | research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:
> "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110 thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
This approach shifts the onus to the company to reveal if they are paying below market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### 3. Put the Question Back on the Recruiter

If you are concerned about pricing yourself out of an opportunity you are genuinely interested in and might consider a lower salary, you can ask the recruiter for their range first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>:
> "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within, and I respect that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>
A recruiter might share what other candidates are being compensated at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, be prepared for them to push back and insist you answer first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Always have a prepared answer ready, but do not avoid the question altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. If the recruiter shows frustration, it's best to simply provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

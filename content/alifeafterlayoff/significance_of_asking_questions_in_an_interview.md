Candidates who fail to ask questions during an interview are often seen as disengaged, which is a common mistake that can hinder a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This is especially true if a candidate has gone through multiple rounds and met various key stakeholders without asking about the role's contribution to the department or specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Why Asking Questions is Crucial

*   **Demonstrates Engagement**: Asking questions shows that the candidate is engaged in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Two-Way Street**: Interviews are a two-way street; candidates should be interviewing the company as much as the company is interviewing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Shows Passion and Selectivity**: If a candidate is passionate about their career, they should be selective about the roles they accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Impresses Hiring Teams**: Asking good questions impresses the hiring teams, who will perceive the candidate as a potentially very engaged employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

## What Kinds of Questions to Ask

Candidates should arrive at the interview prepared with good questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
It is advisable to ask:
*   Questions about how the role contributes to the success of the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   Specifics regarding the objectives to be worked on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   Questions about the company culture to ensure it's the right fit at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

Asking questions during a job interview is crucial for job seekers, as it demonstrates engagement and allows candidates to screen the company for a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Failing to ask questions can be perceived by hiring managers as a lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A bad job can set a career back years, so being selective is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The interview process should be a two-way street, where the candidate also interviews the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Adopt a slightly more aggressive mindset during interviews, viewing it as an opportunity to vet the company as much as they vet you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Select questions most appropriate for your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. While you can ask questions at the end, engaging the interviewer throughout the conversation can lead to a more effective two-way dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Key Questions to Assess Leadership and Company Culture

### 1. Understanding the Role's Opening and Vision

*   **"Why is this position open?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
    *   This question provides insight into the department's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   If the previous person was terminated, laid off, or quit, follow up to understand why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
        *   If they quit due to job dissatisfaction, assess if the work aligns with your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
        *   If terminated, inquire about the areas where they were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   An "added headcount" indicates departmental or company growth, generally a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **"What is your vision for this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
    *   This helps understand the hiring manager's long-term vision and the original intent behind creating the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Asking this early can allow you to tailor your interview answers to align with their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### 2. Identifying Departmental Strengths and Weaknesses

*   **"What's one weakness that you currently have in your department?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
    *   This question helps determine where your skills might fit in and if they align with the department's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   You can also ask about the department's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **"How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
    *   This allows you to decide if you align well with their expectations for the role's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### 3. Assessing Expectations and Success Metrics

*   **"How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
    *   This ensures the expectations are reasonable and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   If the hiring manager has unrealistic expectations, it's an opportunity to push back and clarify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Unreasonable expectations can lead to failure and quick turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   This type of question can help assess if it will be a good [[assessing_company_culture_during_interviews | cultural fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### 4. Learning from Predecessors and Growth Opportunities

*   **"What is it about the person who was previously in this role that made them so successful?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
    *   If the previous person was promoted or moved on, this question offers insight into the behaviors and actions needed to succeed in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   It provides a roadmap for success if you are offered the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **"Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   It's reasonable to inquire about your long-term career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   This question helps ensure the role is not a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Remember to still show strong interest in the specific role you are interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### 5. Evaluating Leadership Style

*   **"What would you describe your leadership style as?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   This helps determine if their leadership style aligns with your preferences for a long-term fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Alternative:** **"If I were to go out into your department and ask some of your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
    *   This version assesses the manager's self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   It's important to understand the type of boss you'll be working for to ensure it's a good [[work_life_balance_and_company_culture | fit for your career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### 6. Understanding Company Strategy and Stability

*   **Research the company's competitors and any new, "industry-shaking" technology or products before the interview.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
*   **"I noticed that one of your competitors came out with a really intriguing new product, process, or idea. How is this company planning to address that and stay in front of the market?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
    *   This gauges the organization's strategic direction and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   A respectable company should be aware of competitors and have a strategic plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
    *   A lack of awareness or strategy is a red flag, indicating potential instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> and raising questions about [[evaluating_job_security_and_company_loyalty | job security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### 7. Identifying Key Concerns

*   **"If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
    *   Listen closely to the answer, as it can provide significant insight into underlying issues or priorities within the department or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

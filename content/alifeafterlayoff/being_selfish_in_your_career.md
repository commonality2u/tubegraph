To advance in your career, it is beneficial to start acting a little more selfishly, especially if you tend to be too polite in professional settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means always looking out for your best interest first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Why Selfishness is Key: The Shifting Landscape

The concept of being selfish in your career is closely related to the idea of acting like a [[importance_of_acting_like_a_free_agent_in_your_career | free agent]] or the CEO of your own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This approach has become particularly relevant in recent times, especially over the last 6 to 8 months, due to a significant softening in the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Widespread layoffs are occurring across industries, starting with tech and spilling over into others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Companies appear not to have learned from past economic shifts, and their treatment of employees, particularly regarding dignity and respect during layoffs, has worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The market has seen a "whiplashing effect," from a rapid economic boom with huge wage increases to an equally swift collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Examples of Unprofessional Layoffs

Numerous stories highlight the unprofessional manner in which companies are handling layoffs:
*   **Google Employee Badge Lockout** A Google employee with over 10 years of service, forced to return to the office, discovered their layoff when their badge no longer worked at the building entrance. There was no prior email or call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Layoffs During Business Trips** Individuals on company business trips have been notified of their layoffs mid-trip, leaving them stranded and without a job away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Layoff While in Labor** A person was laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Short-Tenure Layoff** Someone who left their previous company to join Google was laid off after only 13 weeks, disrupting their life and career path with no accountability from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Such actions demonstrate extremely poor corporate behavior and contribute to widespread dissatisfaction among employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Despite the market volatility, companies often hire recklessly and fail to account for the impact on individual lives, treating employees as mere numbers on a spreadsheet rather than individuals with hopes and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## The Death of Corporate Loyalty

The concept of [[loyalty_and_its_impact_on_career_progression | corporate loyalty]] is obsolete; it effectively "died with the baby boomer generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The era of working 20-40 years for the same company and collecting a pension is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Today's corporate environment operates on a "what have you done for me lately" mentality, with instant gratification driving decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Layoffs can happen instantly when things get tough, only for companies to re-hire in a rush later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## The Power of Acting Like a Free Agent

Acting like a [[importance_of_acting_like_a_free_agent_in_your_career | free agent]] means consistently making the best decision for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

For example, one individual, unexpectedly laid off in November, quickly updated their resume and LinkedIn profile and learned effective networking strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This led to multiple job offers, including one with a $50,000 raise within five weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Even after accepting a new job, they continued interviews for other opportunities. Days into their new role, they received an even stronger offer, $30,000-$40,000 better, making it nearly $100,000 more than their original salary before the layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This demonstrates the benefit of always considering better opportunities and prioritizing your own career growth, even if it means changing jobs quickly after starting a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

You do not owe your employer anything beyond an honest day's work for an honest day's pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Companies often view employees as "human resources" or numbers on a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. As long as you are useful, you have a job; the moment you are not, your position may be eliminated without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Therefore, being selfish and proactively managing your career like a [[strategies_for_reclaiming_control_in_careers | free agent]] is essential for personal and professional stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

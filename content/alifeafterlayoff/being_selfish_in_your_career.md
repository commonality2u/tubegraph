To advance in your career, it's often necessary to embrace a more selfish approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means [[taking_ownership_of_your_career | taking ownership of your career]] and always prioritizing your best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

## Why Selfishness is Essential

The current labor market environment, characterized by frequent layoffs and a definitive softening, makes it crucial to prioritize your own career needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Companies often handle employment processes and layoffs in an unprofessional manner, demonstrating a lack of dignity and respect for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Examples of Poor Corporate Behavior
*   A Google employee who had commuted to the office for 10+ years discovered their layoff when their badge no longer worked to enter the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   Individuals have been notified of layoffs while in the middle of business trips or even during labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   One person was recruited away to Google, only to be laid off after 13 weeks, disrupting their life without accountability from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   Companies like Zillow have laid off recruiting staff only to repost the same jobs shortly after, demonstrating poor forecasting and a lack of care for former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

These examples highlight a lack of accountability and the unfortunate reality that many companies view employees as "human resources" or mere numbers on a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. They will eliminate positions without hesitation if an employee is no longer deemed useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

### The Death of Corporate Loyalty
The concept of corporate loyalty, where employees worked for decades at one company for a pension, is no longer relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Today's workforce operates on an "instant gratification" or "what have you done for me lately" basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Layoffs occur swiftly when times get tough, followed by rushed rehiring, creating a cycle of instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Acting Like a Free Agent
[[acting_like_a_free_agent_for_career_advancement | Acting like a free agent]] (or the CEO of your career) means always looking out for your own best interests first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. There is nothing wrong with being selfish in your career, as no one else will prioritize your well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Benefits of this Approach
*   **Seizing Better Opportunities**: An individual who was laid off received multiple job offers and, by continuing interviews even after accepting one, landed a new position that was nearly $100,000 more than their original job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. This demonstrates the benefit of always considering the best opportunity for your career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Protecting Yourself**: Since you could be laid off even after a short tenure, it's vital to continually think for yourself and maintain a proactive stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. You owe your employer nothing more than an honest day's work for an honest day's pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Holding Companies Accountable**: You can lend your voice to accountability by choosing which companies to accept offers from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Assess how companies have behaved in the past when considering employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

### Practical Steps for Selfish Career Management
*   Keep your resume and LinkedIn profile updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   Learn to network effectively to bypass recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   Continue interviewing even after accepting an offer, as a better opportunity may arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   Ask the right questions during interviews to ensure alignment with companies that have behaved properly and share your core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
*   Utilize platforms like LinkedIn to become discoverable by recruiters and build powerful networks to potentially skip the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

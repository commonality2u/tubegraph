The current job market in the United States is described by some as a "disaster" or "crisis", particularly for those earlier in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While news reports may suggest a strong job market, the reality for job seekers on the front lines is often different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Official job numbers may be misleading, as they factor in individuals holding multiple jobs, being underemployed, or working part-time/contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Many companies that have had layoffs have replaced full-time roles with lower-paying part-time or contract positions, which still contribute to positive job data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Employer Recruitment Practices

Job seekers often encounter perplexing and frustrating [[shady_practices_of_hr_departments | employer practices]]:

### "Urgently Hiring" and Reposting Jobs
Companies frequently claim to be "urgently hiring" but then reject all applicants, only to repost the same job listing a month or two later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Several reasons are speculated for this behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>:
*   **Lack of Suitable Candidates:** The company may not have received any qualified applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Picky Hiring Managers:** The hiring manager might be overly particular about candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **High Turnover:** The company could be a [[predatory_hiring_practices | red flag employer]] with high turnover, constantly needing to refill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Lowball Offers:** An offer might have been made, but the candidate declined due to a low salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Excessive Interview Rounds
Job applicants, especially at the entry level, frequently report going through multiple interview rounds (e.g., three or four) only to be rejected or [[reasons_why_employers_ghost_candidates | ghosted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   For entry-level positions, four rounds of interviews are generally considered excessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. A typical process for college programs might involve a recruiter screen followed by a panel interview with multiple individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. A third interview is rare and typically only for specific remote placements or specialized needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   For experienced, salaried roles, four interview rounds (recruiter screen, hiring manager, panel, and a senior leader check-off) are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Ghosting Candidates
A common and frustrating practice is for companies to simply stop communicating with candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   "Ghosting" is defined as occurring when a candidate has physically spoken to someone in a formal interview process (recruiter, hiring manager, panel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   Even for initial applications, companies should at least send an automated rejection email from their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. It's an easy process within the ATS to disposition candidates with a generic email once a job is filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   If a candidate has gone through multiple interviews and is a strong contender, a more personalized rejection or direct contact from the recruiter is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   The lack of communication can stem from poor [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | hiring practices]] and a failure to clean out candidate pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Companies Profiting from Applications
There's a theory that companies might profit from collecting job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   While companies may inadvertently share candidate information with data brokers like Equifax, who then resell it, the companies themselves typically do not directly profit from collecting application data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It's more likely a result of inefficient or [[shady_practices_of_hr_departments | bad hiring practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## [[ghost_job_postings_in_the_job_market | Ghost Job Postings]]

A significant aspect of current [[employer_strategies_behind_fake_job_listings | employer strategies]] is the use of [[ghost_job_postings_in_the_job_market | ghost jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Evergreen Requisitions:** Employers sometimes post "evergreen requisitions" to continuously collect candidate applications for future hiring needs that are only anticipated, not immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** The idea is to get ahead of recruitment and deliver candidates quicker when an actual hiring need arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Impact:** While theoretically beneficial for the company, this practice leads to a poor candidate experience. It wastes applicants' time, gives them false hope, and often leaves their applications in limbo indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Recruiters also dislike these [[ghost_job_postings_in_the_job_market | ghost requisitions]] as they require managing pipelines without immediate hiring action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Impact on Candidates

These employer practices contribute to a frustrating and often demoralizing job search experience. Candidates might apply to thousands of jobs with little success, leading to feelings of despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The sheer volume of applications can indicate a "spray and pray" approach, where candidates cast a very wide net, which can result in low response rates (less than 1%) because applications are not targeted enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

> "If you're applying for that many jobs, I have to ask the question of, are you being truly targeted?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>

The rise of tools like ChatGPT and "easy apply" buttons has exacerbated the issue, allowing candidates to quickly send out many resumes, which then pile up at companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. Good employers then have thousands of candidates to choose from, often prioritizing those with internship experience, high GPAs, or leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

## Strategies for Job Seekers

To mitigate the effects of these practices, job seekers, especially those early in their careers, should focus on differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>:
*   **Gain Experience:** Internships, co-ops, and part-time jobs during summers are crucial. This experience differentiates candidates and makes them less risky hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Starting internships as early as sophomore year is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Targeted Approach:** Instead of mass applying, identify specific problems you can solve for a company and focus your job search there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Differentiate Yourself:** A college degree, particularly a generic business degree, is often a qualifier, not a differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Candidates need to stand out from the crowd by showcasing unique skills, experiences, or leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Networking:** Leverage personal connections (parents, relatives, community members) to find summer internships and gain initial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Effective Marketing:** Be able to clearly articulate your unique value proposition and market yourself effectively to hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

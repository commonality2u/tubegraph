The speaker shares a personal story about how becoming too comfortable and apathetic in a job can negatively impact one's career trajectory and overall [[employee_satisfaction_and_career_changes | career development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This experience led him to teach others how to "act like the CEO of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Personal Experience: The Stagnant Promotion Promise

Early in his career, the speaker was recruited into a small railroad services company with 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His role as Staffing and Development Manager, essentially an HR Manager, provided "meaty" and valuable experience, allowing him to impact the business by hiring and developing managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The premise for accepting the job was a promise to learn from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was supposed to retire in 18 months, after which the speaker would be promoted to his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### The Work Environment
The workplace was described as:
*   **Supportive Leadership:** His boss, though particular and "old school," had a high degree of empathy for employees and generally looked out for their well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Family-Oriented Culture:** The company fostered a family-oriented atmosphere, and the owners maintained good relationships with employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Laid-Back and Free:** It was not a difficult place to work, relatively laid back, and offered a high degree of freedom with schedule management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### The Unfulfilled Promise
A common issue in the organization was that many senior leaders were delaying retirement, extending their tenure significantly beyond their initial plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. They had "kingdoms" and enjoyed "really nice bonuses," making it hard for them to let go of their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The speaker's boss, despite the initial promise of an 18-month retirement, showed no intention of leaving, often telling the speaker he wasn't "ready yet" without providing actual development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Peers in the leadership development group faced similar issues, with their bosses making hollow promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. One by one, these astute peers left the organization to pursue opportunities elsewhere, often achieving significant promotions like becoming a president at a competitor company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The speaker, however, stayed for nine years, well beyond the initial 18-month expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. He remained due to the steady job, his good standing, and the supportive nature of his boss in certain aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Eventually, after about seven years, he gave up on his dream of leading the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> and transitioned to a marketing/creative role for his final two years at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. His former boss finally retired nine years after the initial promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## [[impacts_of_being_too_comfortable_in_one_job | Impacts of Long-Term Comfort and Apathy]]

Staying in a comfortable, but stagnant, job had several negative consequences for the speaker's career:
*   **Apathy and Comfort:** He became apathetic and overly comfortable, prioritizing a steady paycheck over career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Proactivity:** He didn't push for development or opportunities and waited for things to happen, believing the promises made to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This contrasts with acting like the [[evaluating_career_dissatisfaction | CEO of one's career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Loss of Confidence:** Repeatedly being told he wasn't "ready" caused him to internalize that belief, despite his peers proving their readiness by leaving and succeeding elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This highlights the [[the_role_of_toxic_work_environments_in_job_satisfaction | impact of workplace culture and politics on job satisfaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Loss of Passion:** He lost his desire to pursue the HR leadership role, entering "autopilot" where he performed his duties but no longer sought to go "above and beyond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This reflects [[career_dissatisfaction_and_job_burnout | career dissatisfaction and job burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Stagnation of Skills:** He stopped learning and keeping up with industry trends, technology, and buzzwords, causing him to fall behind his peer group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Career Setback:** When he eventually re-entered the job market, he realized he was significantly behind in skills, knowledge, and compensation compared to his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. He had to take a step down in responsibility to gain the necessary experience, setting him back "a decade" in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This also resulted in thousands of dollars in lost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Recommendations

The speaker emphasizes that his mistakes stemmed from not having a plan or strategy for his career, metaphorically playing "checkers" instead of "chess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. He urges others to:
*   **Act as CEO of Your Career:** Take ownership, create a plan, and don't wait for opportunities to come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Avoid Apathy:** Recognize that a steady paycheck can lead to complacency and prevent making decisions that benefit long-term career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Be Proactive:** Continuously learn, stay current with industry trends, and actively seek development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Your Situation:** Don't spend too much time in an organization where you're waiting for recognition or being kept stuck in a role because you're "too good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Continuously Test the Market:** A true "CEO of their career" consistently entertains other opportunities and leverages their network to ensure they remain available for the best roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

Landing a job interview means you need to ace it, and saying the wrong thing can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While many factors can lead to rejection, often it's what you say or don't say that puts you in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A key component of [[importance_of_interview_preparation | effective interview tactics]] is thorough research of the company.

## Consequences of Not Researching the Company

Asking basic questions about the company's core business or the role itself during an interview creates a very negative impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. If you haven't figured out what the company does by the time you reach the interview stage, you will appear "very unprepared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Similarly, asking what the role entails demonstrates a lack of homework and will not make a good first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Expected Research Prior to an Interview

Before an interview, a recruiter expects candidates to conduct "base level research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This research should cover:
*   The company's core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Products offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Divisions within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Competitors in their market space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Any new technology they've rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

This effort demonstrates your interest in what the company is doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Without it, you'll struggle to convince the interviewer of your genuine interest in the company's missions, vision, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Understanding the Role
Beyond the company, you are expected to have [[importance_of_understanding_the_job_description_for_interviews | read the job description very thoroughly]] and possess a good understanding of what the position aims to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Companies seek problem solvers, not individuals who need constant guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Assessing Company Culture
It's also crucial to look for the company's core value statement to see if it aligns with your own values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. [[assessing_company_culture_during_interviews | A cultural mismatch]] can lead to misery and eventual turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Preparedness
A lack of research results in an "uphill battle for the rest of the interview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Your preparedness reflects your overall attitude. Companies prefer candidates who are self-reliant and proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Being well-prepared and knowing how to sell yourself shows confidence and can mitigate nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Questions to Ask
Towards the end of an interview, interviewers expect you to have a list of "well-thought-out, intelligent questions" about the company, its culture, and your potential fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Not asking any questions indicates a lack of interest or awareness regarding your suitability for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. [[significance_of_asking_questions_in_interviews | Coming prepared with questions]] demonstrates engagement in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

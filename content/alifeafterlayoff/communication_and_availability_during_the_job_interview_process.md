While it's important to identify red flag employers, job seekers should also consider if their own actions are causing employers to pause during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Consistent rejections might indicate a need to adjust how one is portraying themselves to employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Being Difficult Throughout the Interview Process

One significant red flag for candidates is demonstrating difficult behavior at any stage of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This can manifest in several ways:

*   **Unresponsiveness to Recruiters** If a recruiter finds it hard to reach a candidate or experiences delays in returned calls, it can be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Limited Availability** When a candidate's availability is sparse, making it a struggle to schedule interviews, it suggests difficulty in working with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Vague Commitment** Candidates who are vague about their commitment to moving forward, making themselves available for subsequent rounds, or participating in the interview process can be seen as difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Salary Discussions** Kicking the can down the road when asked about salary expectations can put a candidate at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Recruiters might suggest revisiting the conversation when the candidate is ready, while simultaneously moving other candidates forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal for a job seeker should be to make the hiring process as easy as possible for the employer, avoiding any self-imposed roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Professional Demeanor and Respect for All Individuals

A critical red flag is treating individuals involved in the hiring process, with whom one is not directly interviewing, poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This includes:

*   The front desk staff upon entering the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Anyone giving a facility tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Recruiting coordinators responsible for scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Aggressive, belittling, or difficult behavior towards these individuals will likely be reported to the hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Such reports can lead to candidates being removed from the process, as it indicates a lack of [[professional_demeanor_during_an_interview | professionalism]] and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Employers often assume that if a candidate treats "downstream" people poorly before being hired, their behavior would only worsen once onboarded, especially in senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

To avoid this, interact with everyone encountered during the hiring journey with the utmost respect, assuming they could influence the hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Hiring teams frequently solicit feedback from people who provide tours or other administrative support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

It is advisable to consider looking for a new job at least once every two years, even if you are currently satisfied in your role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This proactive approach helps prevent complacency and ensures you remain competitive in the job market, both in terms of [[strategies_for_effective_career_progression | career progression]] and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. To act like the CEO of your career or a "free agent," it is crucial to continually monitor the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Why Staying Too Long Can Be Detrimental

If you remain in a single job for an extended period, the market tends to bypass your current compensation and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### The Underpaid Employee Anecdote

Consider a professional in the medical field who spent seven to eight years with the same employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Despite being a top performer and receiving promotions, their department experienced nearly 100% turnover in 18 months due to high demand for their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This environment encouraged employees to move between jobs to test the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Through networking, this individual received job offers, including one that paid $5 more per hour, though it came with a longer commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. When they informed their current employer of their intent to leave, the employer responded with an unexpected $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The employer justified this by stating they didn't want to lose more staff due to high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

This scenario raises questions about why employers often wait until an employee tenders their resignation to offer fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It suggests that the employee was likely significantly underpaid previously, or the company was taking advantage of a lack of complaints in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Employer Pay Philosophies

Companies typically adopt one of two pay philosophies:
*   **Pay Leaders**: These companies aim to retain talent by paying competitively and can poach talent from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggers**: These companies build turnover into their model, accepting higher attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

However, a high turnover rate incurs significant costs, including recruiting, training, and the loss of institutional knowledge and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### The Appeal and Risks of Counter-Offers

In the anecdote, the employee accepted the $15/hour counter-offer, finding comfort in their existing organization, vested benefits (like vacation and 401k), and familiar processes and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Starting a new job involves a challenging onboarding process, which many prefer to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

However, accepting a counter-offer is generally not recommended for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The concept of "boomeranging" – employees returning to their original employers after finding new roles unsatisfactory – has increased, especially among those who participated in the "Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This highlights that while new opportunities may offer higher salaries, the work might be less fulfilling or the new company dysfunctional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Testing the Open Market Regularly

A crucial [[strategies_for_effective_career_progression | strategy for effective career progression]] is to regularly test the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This should be done at a minimum of once every two years, even if you are content with your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

#### How to Test the Market:
*   Submit a few job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Network with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

#### Benefits of Testing the Market:
*   **Market Awareness**: Stay informed about industry trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Skill Assessment**: Understand the skills companies are seeking and how they assess candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Compensation Evaluation**: If you receive an offer, you can determine if you are underpaid relative to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This can help prevent [[impact_of_a_sporadic_work_history_and_job_hopping | wage stagnation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

While using an offer to leverage a raise from your current employer can be effective, use this technique carefully, as companies may eventually call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Understanding Wage Discrepancies

Companies frequently offer 10-20% raises to new external hires, while internal employees often receive smaller increases (5-10% for promotions or 1-3% for cost-of-living adjustments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This means a new hire with less experience might earn the same or more than a long-term employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Inflation further erodes the real value of stagnant wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Recruiters often find departments with employees paid 20-30% below market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Taking Ownership of Your Career

Regularly assessing the market helps you own your career and ensures you are properly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. If you fall too far behind market rates, it becomes difficult to catch up without a major salary adjustment from your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

> "If you've been there for more than two, maybe three years, you're probably, the market has probably passed you by, and that's where it would behoove you to really look outside of the market just once every couple of years just to make sure that you're staying on the up and up because if you fall too far behind it becomes impossible for you to ever catch up to the market unless your company does a major salary adjustment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>

### Resources for Career Advancement

To attract better opportunities, consider:
*   **Resume Rocket Fuel**: A course to create professional, recruiter-approved resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Ultimate Job Seeker Boot Camp**: Guides you through the interview process, including salary negotiation to ensure you maximize your earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Unlocking LinkedIn**: Teaches how to optimize your profile to attract recruiters and access opportunities through targeted networking, potentially bypassing gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Many significant opportunities come through active and targeted networking, not just job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

Staying informed about the rapidly changing job market is more critical now than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

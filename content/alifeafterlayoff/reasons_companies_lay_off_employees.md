Being caught in a [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoff]] can be a significant ego hit, leading individuals to second-guess themselves and wonder why they were chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explains how companies typically decide which employees are placed on a layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### The Layoff Scenario
The common scenario involves an unexpected meeting notice, followed by a conversation with an HR representative who presents severance terms and informs the employee that their position has been affected by a reduction in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While companies often assure employees it's not their fault, in many cases, it truly isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Reasons for Layoffs

Companies consider several factors when determining who to lay off:

#### 1. Performance-Related Issues
Although often the first assumption, performance is not always the reason for a [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, it is the most obvious and frequently jumped-to conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Lower Performance** This involves an employee's output being lower than that of their team, department, or peers in similar roles across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Companies typically assess measurable aspects like overall performance or output, often tracked by KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Visible performance boards in team rooms can indicate who might be vulnerable during downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Performance Appraisals and Ranking** Companies may review performance appraisal data to identify the lowest performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. They might also use a "nine-box" ranking system where managers rank employees, and those falling into the bottom quadrants are often selected for layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   It is realistic that lower-performing individuals on the performance spectrum are likely to be affected first in layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

#### 2. Seniority (Last In, First Out)
Many companies follow a "last in, first out" principle, targeting newer employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This presents a considerable risk when leaving a long-term, stable position for a new job, as the new employee might be the "low person on the totem pole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, seniority alone will not protect an employee if their performance is significantly lower than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

#### 3. Skills and Role Obsolescence
A layoff might occur due to an employee's skills becoming obsolete or their role no longer being needed by the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This is distinct from a performance issue; if skills are outdated, the company simply doesn't need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The organizational evolution can render certain job types or roles unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The rise of AI's popularity in the workplace is accelerating this trend, making "adapt or be left behind" a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

#### 4. Departmental Need and Strategic Direction Shifts
This is a very common reason, particularly seen in recent tech layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A department might change its focus, deemphasizing certain products or groups that are no longer needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This is tied to the strategic direction of the organization, and employees can be caught in these layoffs through no fault of their own, even if they are top performers or recently promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. A change in leadership can shift strategic direction, leading to the deemphasis of projects and subsequent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

#### 5. Cost-Cutting Measures
[[economic_cycles_and_layoffs | Economic uncertainty]] often drives companies to implement cost-cutting measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Experimental Divisions/Non-Core Businesses** Employees in experimental divisions or those not generating significant revenue are often targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Such projects are often the first to be eliminated during economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **High Salaries** Companies may review departments, identifying individuals with high salaries, especially if their skill sets have atrophied or haven't kept pace with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Replacing a high-salaried employee with a cheaper alternative becomes an easy decision for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Payroll is a significant company expense and is heavily scrutinized during economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, particularly with disruptive technologies like AI potentially eliminating more positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

#### 6. Voluntary Severance Programs
Companies sometimes offer voluntary severance packages, often to incentivize early retirement or provide a lucrative alternative to forced layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. If not enough employees accept these packages, the company will then use other criteria to select individuals for forced layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

#### 7. Legal and Ethical Considerations
While often "hush-hush," legal and ethical considerations can play a role in layoff decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This includes concerns like age-based discrimination, where older, higher-salaried employees might be implicitly targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Other protected classes (gender, creed, color, etc.) might also be considered by unscrupulous companies, although this is not openly admitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Reclaiming Control After a Layoff
After an untimely [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]], it's crucial to reclaim control and act like the CEO of one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Skill Development**: Continuously build skill sets to remain in demand based on the overall market, not just the current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Resume Maintenance**: Keep resumes updated and consider other [[reasons_employees_look_for_new_job_opportunities | job opportunities]] that align with long-term career visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Networking**: Neglect networking, particularly with competitors, to stay well-connected in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Targeted networks are key to landing better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Multiple Income Streams**: Develop multiple income streams to reduce complete dependency on a single employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, freeing oneself to truly be in control of one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

A layoff does not mean an individual is damaged goods or automatically indicates a performance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The current job market is one of the most challenging in recent history, making it significantly harder to find a job compared to a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This shift is partly due to the recent and rapid emergence of [[role_of_emerging_technologies_and_ai_in_the_tech_job_market | Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Companies are actively exploring how [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | AI]] will affect their workforce and are even considering replacing workers with AI solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This has led to a cautious approach to hiring, with many employers pausing open positions to evaluate if AI can perform the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## AI's Influence on Hiring Decisions

Employers find [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | AI]] attractive because an AI "robot" is significantly cheaper, can operate 24 hours a day, and potentially output three to five times more than a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This consideration is a major factor contributing to companies putting the brakes on hiring, making it harder for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Automation in Recruitment

The reduction in talent acquisition staff, especially recruiters who were often the "last one hired, first one fired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, has compelled companies to automate more of their recruitment processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. As a result, job seekers are increasingly interacting with [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | AI]] throughout the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Impersonal and Filtered Processes
The increased reliance on [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | AI]] makes the application process more impersonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. [[improving_recruitment_processes | AI systems]] tend to be "A or B, ones or zeros" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, leading to more rejections because there's no human interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For individuals trying to switch industries or change careers, this lack of human interpretation is a significant disadvantage, as AI systems strictly filter based on criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### AI Biases
Despite hopes that [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | AI]] would eliminate biases, Amazon's experience has shown that this is not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### AI in Interviewing
[[improving_recruitment_processes | AI]] is also extending into the interview process. Companies are beginning to use robots for first-round interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. There's also an increase in one-way video interviews where candidates speak to a camera, and the recording is then assessed, potentially by an [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | AI system]] looking for specific keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This impersonal approach means job seekers are graded without direct human feedback, making it challenging to understand rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Navigating the AI-Driven Market
The current market features fewer quality jobs and more applicants, making it take longer on average to find employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. A LinkedIn study revealed that job seekers are applying to 40% more jobs today than a year ago, with fewer opportunities and increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

To combat this, job seekers need a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Key strategies include:
*   **Mastering resume writing**: A strong, tailored resume can help candidates cut through the competition and stand out to human reviewers, who often find only a small percentage of applications to be a really good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Improving interviewing skills**: With a higher volume of decent candidates, strong interviewing skills are crucial to stand out and negotiate offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Leveraging networks to be found by recruiters**: Ideally, recruiters should be reaching out to job seekers rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This can help bypass the [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_employment | AI systems]] and get directly to the hiring manager for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[strategies_for_leveraging_ai_in_career_development | futureproofing your career against AI]].

For those currently employed, taking steps to protect their careers is advised, as the job market is not favorable for job searching if unexpected layoffs occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This includes preparing for potential [[the_role_of_ai_in_layoffs_and_workforce_reduction | layoffs]] and understanding the [[impact_of_ai_on_job_security | impact of AI on job security]].

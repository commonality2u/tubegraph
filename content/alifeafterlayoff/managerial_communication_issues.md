This article analyzes a viral TikTok video posted by a woman named Alison (stylized as AlisoN in the video) who documented a toxic interaction with her boss, leading to her eventual layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The situation is examined from various perspectives, including those of the employee, the boss, Human Resources, and the company, to determine the root cause of the [[challenges_in_the_modern_workplace | problematic work situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## Initial Observations on the New Manager
Alison's original manager was replaced by a new woman who, according to Alison, was "determined to hate me from day one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The speaker highlights that new managers brought in from outside an organization often have preconceived ideas of what "good" looks like, based on their previous companies, and might not have chosen the existing employees if they were the initial hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. If a new boss is hired externally and was not involved in the employee's hiring, it could be a significant [[assessing_potential_issues_with_a_new_boss_or_manager | red flag]] for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

Alison claimed that the new manager avoided talking to her as much as possible, and when asked for help, would tell her to "go find answers elsewhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The manager also kept her Outlook calendar hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, which contributed to Alison's perception that her manager was trying to set her up for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. These behaviors point to [[challenges_of_working_with_an_aloof_boss | challenges of working with an aloof boss]].

## Lack of PTO Coverage and Communication Breakdown
Alison had accumulated over 100 hours of PTO and took a week off after four months with the new manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. She met with her manager the Wednesday before her leave to discuss coverage, and the manager said they could meet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. However, when Alison emailed on Thursday, she received an out-of-office message stating the manager would be gone Thursday and Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

During her time off, Alison observed that the team email inbox was "completely ignored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Upon her return, the manager showed no intention of discussing what happened while Alison was gone, and many tasks had been ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. The speaker agrees that the manager likely "doesn't have a very good cadence for handling people who are out of office" and exhibits a "consistent communication issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.

## The Confrontational Meeting
After Alison emailed a director expressing concern about the lack of coverage, her manager scheduled a last-minute meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. In this meeting, the manager's agitated tone and the employee's confrontational approach created an unhealthy dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. The employee felt her manager was blaming an IT transition and actively working against her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

Key points from the meeting:
*   **Manager's Perspective**: The manager initially claimed not to recall discussions about her own absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. She expressed frustration when Alison tried to "delegate upward" by giving specific instructions on what needed to be covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a> and demanding updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. The manager stated that "it was not reasonable to be putting access requests into a system that was unstable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a> and that she had "priority items" to deal with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>.
*   **Employee's Actions and Manager's Reactions**: The manager became increasingly upset and short with Alison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>, saying "Listen to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a> and accusing Alison of arguing and being disrespectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55:00">[28:55:00]</a>. The manager also felt Alison's expectations were inappropriate and that Alison was complaining to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Alison's Conduct**: Alison was described as being emotional, losing her cool, and speaking in a "combative" manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>. The speaker notes that Alison's continued escalation was detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>. Alison's perceived lack of [[professional_communication_in_interviews | professionalism]] during the interaction, especially given the reporting relationship, is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>.

## Aftermath: HR and Layoff
Alison reported her manager to HR multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. The speaker cautions that HR is not an employee's "friend" and that complaining to HR can put a "target on your back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. HR's role is to protect the company, not necessarily to advocate for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. When an employee complains, HR investigates by checking the employee's file, performance appraisals, and documented coaching sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>, then speaks with senior leaders and the manager involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. If the complaint lacks concrete evidence and is largely emotional, the employee may be perceived as the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

Alison was laid off, with the company claiming financial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. She subsequently contacted the EEOC, but they declined to investigate her case, indicating a lack of a valid discrimination claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. The speaker, having experience with the EEOC, notes that they are generally employee-focused, and their refusal to investigate suggests the employer had strong evidence to counter any claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of documentation and concrete evidence when pursuing a claim.

Alison's public sharing of the recorded conversations on TikTok and LinkedIn, tagging company CEOs, is criticized as "scarlet lettering herself" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[34:39:00]</a>. Recording conversations without the other party's knowledge can also lead to serious legal trouble, depending on state laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. Her continued public complaints and accusations are seen as making her a "toxic candidate" for future employment, as recruiters and hiring teams check social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
While the new manager displayed [[problems_with_a_micromanager_boss | communication issues]] and likely had a poor management style, the employee's actions, such as going to HR multiple times, bypassing her manager to speak with a director, and persistently escalating arguments in a confrontational manner, contributed to the deterioration of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>. The speaker advises that when a workplace relationship becomes turbulent and confrontational, it is often best for an employee to seek new employment rather than trying to salvage an unsalvageable situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>. Engaging in public criticism of a former employer can significantly hinder future career prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>.

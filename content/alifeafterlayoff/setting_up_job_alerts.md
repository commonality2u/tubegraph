Setting up job alerts is a crucial strategy to accelerate your job search and reduce the time spent actively looking for new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach helps you stay organized and ensures you don't miss out on relevant postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Why Use Job Alerts?

Being unemployed or in a toxic work environment is stressful, and a job search can add to that burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Setting up job alerts saves significant time by eliminating the need to constantly check job boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Manually refreshing job boards daily can be tedious and arduous, potentially impacting mental health, especially if new jobs aren't frequently appearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## How to Set Up Alerts

Most job boards and company Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) offer the functionality to set up alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. You can typically configure these alerts based on:
*   **Keywords** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
*   **Job Type** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>

Once set, the system will email you whenever new job postings match your criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Where to Set Up Alerts

*   **Major Job Boards**: Focus on well-known platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, or Google Job Search, as employers often propagate their job ads to these larger sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While niche job boards exist, many jobs posted there also appear on major boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Wasting time on obscure, niche sites is generally inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. You can still save time by setting up alerts on these specific boards if you prefer them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. For more information on using these effectively, see [[effective_use_of_job_boards | Effective Use of Job Boards]].
*   **Company ATS Systems**: If you have a specific company of interest, set up alerts directly on their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Benefits of Early Application

Setting up alerts allows you to be among the first to apply for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. It is generally preferable to apply early in the process, as waiting too long might mean the employer has already identified a suitable candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This proactive approach is a significant time-saver in your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

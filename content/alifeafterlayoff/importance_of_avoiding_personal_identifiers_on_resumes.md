When crafting a resume, it is crucial to [[avoiding_common_resume_mistakes | avoid certain common mistakes]] and omit specific personal identifiers. The resume serves as the first impression made on a recruiter and hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, and a clean, concise, and well-crafted document helps candidates stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Recruiters consistently observe mistakes where applicants include information that could lead to unfair judgment or discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The goal is to eliminate any decisions made about a candidate that are not work-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Personal Information to Omit
To give yourself the best chance of getting noticed, remove anything that could be considered a personal identifier from your resume. This includes:

### Photographs
In the U.S. and North America, including a photograph on your resume is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. A recruiter seeing a resume with a photo might automatically assume the applicant is not based in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While customs vary by country, for those seeking work in the United States, it's best to omit photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The only exception might be for creative fields like art director or graphic designer, where a unique graphic could demonstrate creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Protected Class Information
Avoid stating your gender, race, creed, color, or marital status on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Information such as being married with two children should also be left out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This information, particularly anything identifying a protected class, could potentially be used against you by an unscrupulous employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While this tip is U.S. specific, the general advice is to avoid more detail than necessary on non-work-related matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Unprofessional Email Addresses
Using an unprofessional email address, such as one from college years, can lead to negative assumptions by hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. It's advisable to create a neutral email address, such as a Gmail account using your full name or a simple moniker, to avoid potential judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Full Home Addresses
A full home address is no longer necessary on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Recruiters only need to know your city and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Providing a specific address can give an employer a reason to discriminate, for example, based on perceived commute distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. A hiring manager might screen out an applicant if a long commute led to a previous employee quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For remote workers, including city and state is still important for time zone considerations and taxation issues, as companies need to be set up to do business in specific geographic regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Salary History
Never include your previous salary history or expected compensation on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Disclosing this information could lock you into a lower salary or make you vulnerable to a lowball offer, even if the employer has a healthier salary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Salary discussions are typically handled in the first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

By omitting these personal identifiers, you help ensure that your resume is judged solely on your qualifications and experience, increasing your chances of getting a job interview.

When creating a resume, it is crucial to use a professional email address, as unprofessional ones can lead to negative judgments or assumptions by hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. A resume serves as the first impression made on recruiters and hiring teams, highlighting the [[importance_of_a_strong_resume | importance of a strong resume]] in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Maintaining [[professional_online_behavior_and_its_impact | professional online behavior]] is key, and an unprofessional email address can detract from an otherwise well-crafted document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Why Professionalism Matters

Recruiters frequently encounter "colorful" or inappropriate email addresses, such as "partyboy28@yahoo.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Such addresses can raise questions about an applicant's judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The goal is to avoid giving a hiring manager any reason to make assumptions or potentially discriminate against an applicant based on non-work-related factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Recommendations for Professional Email Addresses

If an email address was created during college years and is now deemed unprofessional, it is advisable to create a new, clean email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

A good approach is to:
*   Create a Gmail account using your full name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   Use a moniker that is relatively neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Avoid using nicknames or anything that could potentially lead to discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Always aim for a clean, neutral email address to ensure your application is judged solely on your qualifications and professional experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

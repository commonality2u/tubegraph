When seeking re-employment, optimizing your resume is a critical necessity for any job seeker to speed up the process and stand out from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A generic resume is insufficient in today's labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Resume Optimization

### ATS Compliance
One crucial aspect of resume optimization involves ensuring compliance with [[resume_best_practices_and_ats_compliance | Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These systems screen out candidates based on specific criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While an [[resume_best_practices_and_ats_compliance | ATS system]] generally doesn't screen out a resume as much as a human does, ensuring it can correctly see your resume allows for future discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. There are many components involved in making a resume [[resume_best_practices_and_ats_compliance | ATS compliant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Customization for Human Review
Even more important than [[resume_best_practices_and_ats_compliance | ATS compliance]] is having a custom resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. In a large pool of candidates (e.g., 700 applications for a senior position in 24 hours), recruiters use [[resume_best_practices_and_ats_compliance | ATS systems]] to search for specific criteria to narrow down candidate pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. An optimized resume is more likely to appear in these searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Customizing and optimizing your resume is essential to speed up your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Creating Multiple Targeted Resumes
If you possess different specialties or are a great fit for more than one role, creating multiple resumes is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Sending a resume that portrays you as a "jack of all trades" typically dilutes your results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Instead, a more targeted resume sent to a hiring manager has a higher likelihood of piquing their interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Avoid sending the same generic resume to all jobs you apply to, as this typically yields poor results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Impact of Unoptimized Resumes
If you are applying for job after job and not receiving responses or interest, especially when you are reasonably qualified for the roles, it is almost always an issue with your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Applying to jobs where you do not closely match 70% or more of the job description's requirements is unlikely to result in a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Relying on an employer to infer transferable skills from a non-relevant resume is a long shot and wastes time, potentially slowing down your job search and leading to rejections that can negatively affect mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. It is better to focus time on jobs for which you are genuinely well-qualified, as these are the ones most likely to lead to interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

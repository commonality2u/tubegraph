When an employee signals their intent to leave, their current company may suddenly scramble to provide a [[negotiating_a_counter_offer | counteroffer]], promising things like a new job title and a bigger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This can create a stressful situation for the employee deciding between a new opportunity and accepting the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Why You Should Never Accept a Counteroffer

A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises against accepting a counteroffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The core reason is that the initial motivators for seeking new employment generally persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### [[employee_retention_statistics_postcounteroffer | Employee Retention Statistics Post-Counteroffer]]

Real-life experience and statistics suggest that accepting a counteroffer rarely leads to long-term satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   An overwhelming majority (80% or more) of people who accept counteroffers will not be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   An even higher percentage, 93%, will not be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Candidates who accept counters often reach back out to the recruiter within a year, looking for a new position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### [[risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | Risks of Accepting a Counter Offer]] and [[reasons_to_decline_a_counter_offer | Reasons to Decline a Counter Offer]]

Several significant [[risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | risks]] and [[reasons_to_decline_a_counter_offer | reasons]] exist for declining a counteroffer:

*   **Unresolved Issues Persist**: If you were looking to leave due to a bad boss, poor company culture, work-life balance issues, a difficult commute, or terrible benefits, these problems will likely remain after accepting a counteroffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Undervaluation and Exploitation**: The company only made a counteroffer once you threatened to leave, implying they were undervaluing your contributions or taking you for granted until that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Buying Time to Replace You**: The counteroffer might be a tactic to buy the company time to find your replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Damaged Relationships and Trust**: Your relationships at work, especially with your boss, will not be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Having broadcast your intention to leave, your boss will likely begin formulating a contingency plan for your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Increased Risk of Adverse Employment Decisions**: You may be labeled as not long-term committed to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. If the company faces a rough patch, you might be among the first considered for layoffs, especially if your salary has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **"Locked In" Phenomenon**: If you are highly effective in your current role, the company might be hesitant to promote you earlier to avoid losing your productivity in that specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. A counteroffer might be a reactive measure rather than a proactive recognition of your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **"Honeymoon Period" is Temporary**: While conditions might improve for a short "honeymoon period" after accepting a counter, this will eventually wear off, and the old issues are likely to resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Even if you are promoted to a new role with a new boss, you will still work alongside the old boss whom you effectively threatened to quit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### [[longterm_career_impact_of_accepting_counteroffers | Long-Term Career Impact of Accepting Counteroffers]]

Accepting a counteroffer can negatively affect your [[longterm_career_impact_of_accepting_counteroffers | long-term career prospects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Senior leaders might perceive you as less dedicated and pass you over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The promised role might be merely a temporary measure to keep you satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Personal Experience

A recruiter shared an anecdote about a candidate who turned around a moving truck mid-journey to accept a counteroffer, only to call the recruiter less than six months later regretting the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Conclusion

Considering a counteroffer requires careful thought about its long-term impact on your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It's akin to an old relationship: "look back on it fondly, but remember that it ended for a reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Being selfish with your career is essential, as companies prioritize their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

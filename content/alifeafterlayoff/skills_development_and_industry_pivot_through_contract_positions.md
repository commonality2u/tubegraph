Contract positions, often viewed with a [[The pitfalls of contract offers over full time positions | stigma]] due to their temporary nature, can serve as a strategic tool for [[Career management and development | career management and development]], particularly for skills development and pivoting into new industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. As a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, the speaker shares insights into how [[Recruiters perspective on contract positions | recruiters]] view contracting and how individuals should approach these roles from a career coaching perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Demonstrating Skills and Reducing Employer Risk

Contract positions are often more readily available, especially in uncertain markets, as companies may be apprehensive about adding permanent headcount but still need work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This increased availability means a higher likelihood of being considered for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Furthermore, contracts provide an excellent opportunity to demonstrate your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. From an employer's perspective, a contract position carries less risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If an employer is apprehensive about a candidate, perhaps viewing them as a "stretch" or if the role requires a niche skill set, a contract allows the individual to prove their capability without the long-term commitment of a full-time hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Hiring managers tend to be risk-averse because they live with the headcount decisions and are nervous about poor hiring choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Some contract roles are specifically created to reduce risk for hiring managers, allowing candidates to come in, prove themselves, and potentially convert to full-time if they contribute well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. It's a good question to ask during an interview whether there's a likelihood for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Pivoting into New Industries or Job Types

Contracting offers a valuable pathway to pivot into a new industry, a different job type, or to gain new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. If local [[Job market trends and the tech industry | job market trends]] require specific software skills or industry experience that an individual lacks, a contract can bridge that gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

For example, in a city dominated by industries like hospitals, the medical field, or tech, someone from a manufacturing or finance background can use a contract position to gain experience in these new fields, thereby "pivoting" their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This allows them to get their foot in the door and subsequently claim experience in the new domain, such as healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Contract positions are a strategic way to fill skill gaps on a resume, making candidates more effectively marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Other Benefits

*   **Continued Income:** Contracting provides a way to maintain income while searching for a long-term full-time position, which can take six to nine months or even longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This "buys more time" in the job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Test Driving the Company:** Just as companies can "test drive" a contractor, individuals can assess the work environment, job type, co-workers, and management before committing to a permanent role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Confidence Boost:** For those who have experienced layoffs, a contract position can help boost confidence, re-establish a routine, and provide a steady income, which makes further job searching easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Potentially Higher Hourly Pay:** In many cases, contract positions can offer a significantly higher hourly rate compared to full-time roles, although this often comes without benefits and the long-term security of a permanent job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Some individuals manage their careers by taking lucrative contracts and then taking breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Considerations

Despite the benefits, a potential negative of frequent contracting, especially early in one's [[Career management and development | career]], is developing a "hopping resume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Many hiring managers prefer candidates who demonstrate commitment to long-term projects and building relationships, which can be challenging in short-term contract roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

When evaluating job opportunities, a significant [[red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] to consider is when the actual job does not match its description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:27">[03:14:27]</a>. This can lead to serious problems if the job is accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:21">[04:01:21]</a>.

## Identifying Discrepancies
You might apply for a position based on a job description that seems like a great fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:15">[03:16:15]</a>. However, during the interview, the hiring manager may describe a role that has significantly shifted or is completely different from the advertised job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:42">[03:26:42]</a>.

Another common tactic is for employers to promise a shift into the originally desired role after several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>. These situations are major red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>.

## "Bait and Switch" Tactics
Poor quality employers often use a "bait and switch" tactic to attract candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:28">[03:44:28]</a>. They tend to hide or "sugarcoat" the undesirable aspects of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:04">[04:03:04]</a>. The likelihood of actually transitioning into the advertised role is very slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:28">[03:44:28]</a>.

## Unrealistic Expectations and Compensation
A common related issue is when job expectations do not align with the offered compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:51">[04:11:51]</a>, linking to the broader issue of [[unaligned_compensation_and_job_expectations | unaligned compensation and job expectations]].

*   **Experience vs. Pay** The job description may ask for a level of experience or responsibility far beyond what the employer is willing to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:47">[04:16:47]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Balance** Such roles often come with unrealistic expectations that will severely impact your work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:44">[04:23:44]</a>. For example, a manager role might require overseeing a department twice as large with more responsibility, yet offer $30,000 less than the appropriate salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:21">[04:31:21]</a>.
*   **Low Quality Employers** Low quality employers are reluctant to pay fair market wages and frequently expect too much for sub-par compensation and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:11">[04:47:11]</a>. They might dangle unrealistic incentives like trips, company cars, or large bonuses that are practically impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:04">[04:57:04]</a>. These situations often involve high levels of micromanaging, poor communication, and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:21">[05:16:21]</a>.

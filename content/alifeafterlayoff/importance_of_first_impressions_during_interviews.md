[[first_impressions_in_job_interviews | First impressions]] are critical in the job interview process and can significantly impact a candidate's chances of moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Showing up late or unprepared are immediate red flags that often appear early in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Punctuality
Arriving late to an interview, whether due to traffic or parking issues, can lead interviewers to assume that you do not manage your time effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This immediately puts the candidate at a disadvantage, as the interviewer forms a poor initial impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Preparedness
A lack of [[preparing_for_interviews_effectively | preparedness]] is another significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Examples include being caught off guard when the recruiter calls at the pre-arranged time, or even being asleep at the time of the scheduled interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Such instances result in a poor [[first_impressions_in_job_interviews | first impression]] and often lead to poor interview performance, preventing candidates from advancing to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

> "Being on time and being prepared is something that you can control so there's really no excuse for this one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>

The ability to be on time and prepared is entirely within the candidate's control, leaving no valid excuse for shortcomings in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. To improve [[improving_job_interview_performance | job interview performance]], candidates should focus on strategic preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

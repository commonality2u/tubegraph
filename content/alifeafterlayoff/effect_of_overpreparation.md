While [[importance_of_interview_preparation|preparation]] for job interviews is crucial, there is a point where it can become a detriment, leading to an "over prepared" state that constitutes a [[common_interview_mistakes|common mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## Over-Researching the Company

Candidates might delve too deeply into company information, such as investor relations materials or obscure data, trying to impress the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. However, delivering a "book report" about everything the company has done is not necessarily impressive and can come across as "overboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. While showing engagement, excessive detail can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

## Over-Rehearsing Interview Answers

Another aspect of over-preparation involves being "so rehearsed" with [[interview_questions_preparation|interview questions]] that responses sound like they are "off of a script" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### Loss of Authenticity

When a candidate is overly rehearsed, any deviation from their prepared script can cause them to become "robotic" and "trip up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. This can lead to appearing "overly nervous and inauthentic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Although some rehearsing of [[interview_questions_preparation|interview questions]] is encouraged, "too much of it is a bad thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

## Emphasizing Authenticity

Instead of memorizing scripts, candidates should approach their [[interview_preparation_and_selfpresentation|self-presentation]] as a series of "story arcs" drawn from the major experiences of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This allows them to pull from those real-life storylines to answer various questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Authenticity is key; if a candidate has genuinely done the things they are discussing, they should be able to speak about them in depth with passion and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

Being caught in a [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]] can be a significant "ego hit," leading individuals to second-guess themselves and wonder why they were chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While many factors contribute to layoff decisions, seniority is a common consideration that companies employ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Seniority as a Layoff Factor

One of the primary [[criteria_companies_use_for_employee_layoffs | criteria companies use for employee layoffs]] is seniority, particularly targeting newer employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This often follows a "last in, first out" mentality, where those who have recently joined the company are frequently the first to be targeted for removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Risks for Newer Hires

There is considerable risk in leaving an established position to take a new job, as it might make one the "low person on the totem pole" in terms of tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. If an individual moves to a new company, it's crucial to ensure strong performance because seniority alone may not protect them if their performance is lower than that of their new teammates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Seniority and Cost-Cutting Measures

While newer employees may be targeted, individuals who are senior in their careers can also find themselves on a layoff list, especially during cost-cutting measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This can occur if their [[role_of_skills_and_departmental_need_in_layoffs | skills]] have atrophied or they haven't kept pace with market demands, despite having accumulated a large salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. In such cases, companies might deem it an easy decision to replace them with a cheaper alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, as payroll is a significant company expense that is closely scrutinized during economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Voluntary Severance Programs

Companies sometimes offer voluntary severance programs, particularly to more senior employees, as a way to reduce workforce size without forced layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. These programs might offer lucrative packages that encourage early retirement or a voluntary departure, reducing the need for involuntary terminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. If not enough employees opt for voluntary severance, the company will then apply other layoff criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Mitigating Layoff Risk

Despite the unpredictability, individuals can adopt [[strategies_for_mitigating_layoff_impacts | strategies for mitigating layoff impacts]] and reclaim control of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Key actions include:
*   **Building in-demand skills:** Regularly updating [[role_of_skills_and_departmental_need_in_layoffs | skill sets]] to align with broader market demands, not just current company needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Maintaining an up-to-date resume:** Keeping one's [[strategies_for_mitigating_layoff_impacts | resume]] current and exploring other opportunities that align with long-term career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Strategic networking:** Actively [[strategies_for_mitigating_layoff_impacts | networking]], even with competitors, to stay well-connected within the industry, as targeted networks are crucial for landing better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Developing multiple income streams:** Reducing complete dependence on a single employer by cultivating [[strategies_for_mitigating_layoff_impacts | multiple streams of income]], which offers greater control and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

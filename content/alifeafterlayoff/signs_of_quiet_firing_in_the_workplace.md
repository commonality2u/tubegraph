Have you heard of [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet quitting]]? What if a company tries to do it to you in the form of [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet firing]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> This article will share [[signs_of_potential_job_termination | signs that you're being pushed out by a company]] by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, especially if you have an uneasy feeling your days might be numbered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## What is Constructive Dismissal?

In HR, there is a concept called "constructive dismissal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Essentially, it's when a company makes your work or employment situation so unbearable that you have no other option but to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Reasons Companies Use Constructive Dismissal

Companies might consider constructive dismissal for several reasons:
*   They deem you a potential problem, and direct termination could cause additional issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   They may try to avoid paying out certain benefits, such as unemployment insurance, because if you leave voluntarily, they are not obligated to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Signs You're Being Quiet Fired

Here are some [[signs_of_potential_job_termination | signs you should be looking for]] that the company is looking to [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet fire]] you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:

### 1. No Raises for Several Years
This is a red flag, especially if you know that other people in your department or company have received raises but you haven't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. If the company has decided to cut you off from future raises while others are getting them, it's a good indicator to update your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### 2. Repeatedly Passed Up for Promotion
If you have made it known you are interested in a promotion and have done everything to position yourself as the best fit, but it never comes or you are skipped over by potentially less deserving individuals, pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. When a company promotes someone else, there's often a discussion behind the scenes about the potential fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. If you're continually blocked from promotion, it's probably not an opportunity you want to stick with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. It's best to act like a "free agent," update your resume, work on your networks, and enter the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### 3. PTO/Vacation Requests Repeatedly Denied
If your paid time off (PTO) or vacation requests are repeatedly denied, assuming you're not abusing it, the timing makes sense, and you've coordinated with your department for coverage, it indicates the employer likely does not value you and wants to make your life uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Taking PTO regardless of approval might lead to the next warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### 4. Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
Being placed on a PIP or other performance management tool usually means the company is starting to manage you out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. However, being on a PIP does not automatically mean you're being exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. If the PIP seems unreasonable and not based in reality, it's likely an indicator they are looking to manage you out or subtly encourage you to leave voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### 5. Schedule Changes (Mandatory Overtime or Reduced Hours)
*   **Mandatory Overtime:** If your schedule is suddenly messed with, such as a bunch of mandatory overtime during periods the boss knows you'd be unavailable or burdened, it's likely you're being managed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Reduced Hours:** Conversely, your hours could be cut to the bare minimum to keep you employed, potentially impacting your benefits eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. For hourly or shift-paid individuals, this could severely impact your paycheck, which is a common reason to [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | look for a new job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The company might gently encourage you to leave by manipulating your hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### 6. Unbearable Workload
If schedule changes don't work, the company might try to dump so much work on you that it's unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Any reasonable person doing double the work with no additional pay and forced hours they don't want to work would be motivated to [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | look for another job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Some unscrupulous companies use this to their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### 7. Suddenly Lackluster Performance Appraisals
Look for suddenly lackluster performance appraisals, especially if you've had good ones in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If your boss is overly critical about things they were usually complimentary about, it's a sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. HR departments use performance appraisals as part of formal documentation, and if you're deemed a performance issue, your boss would be actively engaged with HR to manage and monitor it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Criticism, whether right or wrong, can be very demotivating and force you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### 8. Boss No Longer Communicating with You
Major warning signs include your boss not showing up to private one-on-one syncs, rescheduling at the last minute, not making you a priority, or not responding to emails in a timely manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. They might always seem busy or have their door closed to you, or fail to provide information or help clear roadblocks you need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This indicates your boss could be disengaging from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### 9. Removed from Typical Work or Social Involvement
If you're suddenly removed from work you were typically involved with, it's a warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This could include a project you were leading being handed off to someone else, not being invited to staff meetings you used to attend, or no longer being privy to "water cooler talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. You might even be shunned in public when your boss is with other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] This is not an all-encompassing list. If you notice one or two of these things, it doesn't automatically mean you're being [[quiet_quitting_and_quiet_firing | quiet fired]], but you should start paying attention and trust your gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Options If You Suspect Quiet Firing

If you find yourself in a situation where you think the company is constructively discharging you or preparing for it, you have some options:

### 1. Force the Company's Hand
You can continue the status quo and [[getting_fired_effects_and_implications | force the company's hand and let them terminate you]] if that is their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### 2. Quit and Find a Better Job

Staying in a [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | toxic environment]] that is not healthy for you is detrimental to your personal life, mental health, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. It's better to [[signs_you_need_a_new_job | find a place that's going to be better]] for you in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

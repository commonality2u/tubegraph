If something at work doesn't feel quite right, it might be a [[signs_you_need_a_new_job | sign you should consider looking for a new job]] before the market shifts and becomes less favorable for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience has identified common [[reasons_employees_look_for_new_job_opportunities | reasons job seekers are leaving their jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Key Indicators to Consider Leaving Your Job

### You're Underpaid
One of the most common [[reasons_employees_look_for_new_job_opportunities | reasons for leaving a job]] is feeling underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Market Research**: If market research shows that others in similar roles, either joining your company or leaving it, are receiving significantly higher salaries, you are likely underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Salary Growth**: If your current salary is significantly below the market rate, it's an easy decision to update your resume and start looking for new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Relying on incremental merit or cost-of-living increases (typically 2-3%) will prevent you from catching up to market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: With high inflation, if your annual raise didn't meet or exceed 7-8%, you effectively took a pay cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Explosive Salary Growth**: Certain job types, like tech recruiting, have seen massive salary increases (30-40% or more) due to competitive markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Long Tenure**: If you've been in your role for five years or longer, you will likely be pleasantly surprised by current market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### You're Constantly Overloaded or Overworked
Many employees are feeling constantly overloaded or overworked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Impact of "Great Resignation"**: Due to many people leaving the workforce and companies struggling to backfill talent, existing employees are left to pick up the slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Cost Cutting**: Companies facing rising costs due to inflation may cut expenses by not replacing employees, leading to one person doing the work previously done by two, often requiring 70-90 hours of work per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Burnout**: This unsustainable workload inevitably leads to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> If seeking a new role due to being overworked, ask thorough questions during interviews to ensure you're not jumping into another company's similar issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The grass isn't always greener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Your Company is Facing Financial Difficulties
Companies struggling with rising costs for materials, shipping, and general business operations may struggle to fill vacant positions or offer competitive salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Lack of Investment**: A struggling company might work employees excessively without offering vacations to decompress, which indicates a lack of investment in employee well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Layoffs**: An uptick in layoffs, even in a strong market, can be a [[signs_you_need_a_new_job | sign you should evaluate your company's financial stability]] and consider other opportunities before you're caught in a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### You Dread Monday Mornings
A strong sense of dread when Monday morning arrives, or experiencing the "Sunday scaries" indicates something is wrong with your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Lack of Engagement**: This dread suggests you are not fully engaged or passionate about your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Wrong Fit**: It could mean you are in the wrong job type, the wrong company, or you're experiencing burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Your Company is Forcing a Return to Office Without Good Reason
For remote workers, being forced back to the office simply for "facetime" or to utilize expensive office space, without a compelling job-related reason, is a good reason to consider other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Remote Opportunities**: Many companies actively target candidates from organizations forcing a return to office by offering fully remote positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Outdated Thinking**: While some argue that in-office presence helps with promotional opportunities due to networking, this is an old-school perspective. Remote-first companies successfully promote employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### You're "Quiet Quitting" or Producing Less
If you find yourself doing less and less work due to burnout, lack of motivation, or a lack of passion, it's a [[signs_you_need_a_new_job | sign to make a change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable**: This "quiet quitting" behavior is not sustainable long-term and will not help your standing with your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Need a Change**: It may indicate a need for a break, a different employer, or an entirely different job type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### You Feel Stagnated
Feeling stagnated, not learning anything new, or being unable to develop your full potential is a common reason for quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Blocked Mobility**: This includes situations where there's no upward mobility because senior roles are occupied by people unlikely to leave soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Act Like a Free Agent**: If you're ready for the next step and feel blocked, it's a clear [[signs_you_need_a_new_job | sign to seek another job]] that allows you to achieve your career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Your Boss or Co-workers are Toxic
Working in a toxic environment that negatively impacts your mental or physical wellness is a critical reason to leave quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Broad Impact**: A toxic boss or co-worker can affect your upward mobility, work-life balance, sanity, and even health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Test the Waters**: There are many other opportunities with better quality employers, so it's not worth staying in a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Your Health is Suffering
If your job is causing your health to suffer, it's a definite [[signs_you_should_quit_your_job_immediately | sign to look for other opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Physical and Mental Impact**: This can manifest as stress, anxiety, sudden weight changes, temperament shifts, sleep cycle disruptions, or requiring medication due to your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **No Positive Outcome**: There is no positive outcome to sacrificing your health for a job, and waiting for a promotion is not a valid excuse for staying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### All Your Co-workers Are Quitting
If you notice many of your co-workers are quitting, it's a strong indicator that you should also consider updating your resume and looking around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Compelling Reasons**: Chances are, there are compelling reasons why others are leaving, often for happier situations and better pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Networking**: Network with former co-workers to explore potential opportunities on their new teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Life is too short, and the job market can be strong enough to find a situation that is 100% ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

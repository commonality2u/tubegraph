Career cushioning is the latest employment trend, representing a proactive approach to managing one's career in an uncertain job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It involves taking steps to prepare for the possibility of job loss, ensuring a softer landing if an "unplanned income disruption" occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Evolution of Employment Trends

The concept of [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_resilience | career cushioning]] emerged from a series of significant employment trends over the past few years:

*   **2020 Economic Downturn and the Pandemic**
    The pandemic led to a major economic downturn in 2020, with many employers making knee-jerk reactions and laying off numerous employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Remaining employees faced increased workloads and stress, often under the pervasive mantra of "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This period saw employers demanding more while cutting expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **The Great Resignation**
    As burnout increased, many employees, including those displaced and those remaining, began to reevaluate their careers and what they truly wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This led to the "Great Resignation," a wave of employees leaving their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The pendulum of power swung dramatically towards the job seeker, creating a "Heyday of job seeking" with abundant opportunities, raises, and perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Quiet Quitting**
    During this period, some burned-out employees who didn't want to leave their jobs opted for "quiet quitting," doing the bare minimum without risking their employment due to the high demand for labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Quiet Firing**
    As the pendulum began to swing back towards employers, regaining power in the marketplace, hiring slowed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This led to "quiet firing," where employers would subtly encourage employees to quit rather than outright fire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Current Market Conditions and the Need for Career Cushioning

As of December 2022, the job market remains shaky and is increasingly moving towards an uncertain labor market, with the pendulum of power continuing to swing more towards the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While the overall labor market shows signs of strength, specific industries, particularly tech, have been severely impacted by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives revealed that 50% of respondents were reducing their overall headcount, indicating that companies are "right-sizing" after potentially over-hiring during the boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Indicators of this shift include:
*   Hiring freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
*   Reduction in overall headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>
*   Lowering or dropping of sign-on bonuses and perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>
*   44% of companies rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>

These conditions emphasize the importance of [[strategies_for_protecting_your_career | protecting your career]] and taking proactive steps to maintain [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_stability | career resilience and stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## What is Career Cushioning?

[[strategies_for_career_resilience and advancement | Career cushioning]] means proactively planning for the possibility of losing your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. It's about creating a safety net and acting like a "free agent," always doing what's best for one's own [[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This ensures that one is never caught off guard by a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

While some consider it a new trend, many individuals who actively manage their careers have been practicing these steps for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The term "cushioning" is likened to dating, where one builds a side option to soften the blow of a potential breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. In a job context, it's about preparing for a potential job separation to land softer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

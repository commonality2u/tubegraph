[[proactive_career_management_strategies | Career cushioning]] is the latest employment trend, defined as proactively planning to cushion the possibility of losing one's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. It involves setting up a safety net to ensure a softer landing in case of an "unplanned income disruption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The concept encourages individuals to "act like a free agent" and take [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_resilience | proactive steps]] to protect their [[career_management_and_planning | career trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Emergence of Career Cushioning: A Response to Market Volatility

The concept of [[proactive_career_management_strategies | career cushioning]] has emerged following a series of significant shifts in the employment market over recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### The Pandemic and Its Aftermath
In 2020, a major economic downturn caused by the pandemic led many employers to make "knee-jerk reactions," resulting in mass layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Remaining employees faced increased work burdens, long hours, and the pervasive mantra of "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This period led to widespread burnout and a reevaluation of what individuals desired from their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### The Great Resignation
The subsequent "Great Resignation" saw the pendulum swing dramatically in favor of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This was a "Heyday of job seeking," characterized by abundant opportunities, significant raises, and frequent job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many individuals left stable environments for riskier but higher-paying roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Quiet Quitting and Quiet Firing
Following the Great Resignation, "quiet quitting" emerged among burned-out employees who opted to remain in their jobs but disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. As the market began to stabilize, employers started to regain power, leading to "quiet firing," where companies subtly encouraged employees to quit rather than initiating outright terminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### The Current Landscape (December 2022)
As of December 2022, the labor market remains shaky, with the pendulum swinging back towards employer dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. While the overall labor market shows some strength, certain sectors, particularly tech, have experienced severe layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives revealed that 50% are reducing headcount, and 44% are rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These indicators, including hiring freezes and reduced perks, suggest a potentially rocky 2023 for employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This uncertain environment has led to the emergence of [[proactive_career_management_strategies | career cushioning]] as a necessary [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_planning_amid_layoffs | job security strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

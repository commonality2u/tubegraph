Traditionally, a career path involved selecting a profession at age 18, dedicating 40 years to it, collecting a pension, and then retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This model implied strong loyalty between the employee and the employer, with both expecting a long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. People recall their grandparents or parents working long, traditional careers, often landing jobs easily through connections or basic resumes, and then enjoying a fulfilling 45-year career with a great pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Employers in those times treated employees with a degree of loyalty, and it was expected that layoffs would not be constant occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If an employee wasn't performing well in one role, they might be moved to a different department rather than being let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Shift from Defined Benefits to Defined Contributions

A significant [[changing_expectations_in_the_modern_workplace | decoupling]] in the workplace, particularly regarding retirement, occurred with the shift from defined benefits plans to defined contribution plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Defined Benefit Plans
In the past, employers commonly covered the entirety of an employee's retirement plan through pensions and other defined benefit programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Defined Contribution Plans
At some point in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, there was a transition to a defined contribution plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This shift moved the entire burden of retirement funding onto the employee, with employers typically providing only a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Consequently, employees are now solely responsible for financing their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Impact of Vesting Periods
Further complicating matters, companies introduced long vesting periods, often four years or more, to claim the employer's matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This meant that if an employer matched a small percentage (e.g., 3-4%) of an employee's income, the employee had to work a specified number of years (usually at least four) to gain ownership of that matched money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. If an employee was laid off before the vesting period was complete (e.g., after two years), the employer was no longer obligated for the remaining vesting period and would reclaim the matched money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This has further reduced employer commitment to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Consequences for Modern Employees
The changing nature of employment, with frequent layoffs and the lack of traditional employer loyalty, means employees cannot rely on employers to fund their 401(k)s, especially if they are frequently laid off before vesting periods are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This situation can be particularly disruptive for older professionals nearing the end of their careers, who might realize they are unprepared for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

There are also discussions suggesting that the retirement age might need to be pushed back to 70 or even beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. These changes necessitate that individuals approach their careers with a more strategic mindset, acting as a "free agent" and the CEO of their own career, rather than expecting an employer to look out for their best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

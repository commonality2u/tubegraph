A museum security guard reported an hourly wage of $29.50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. This is considered surprisingly high for the role, suggesting a good income for a job that is likely not high-stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

### Railroad Freight Conductor
A railroad freight conductor earns around $70,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

### Garbage Man
Anecdotal reports suggest garbage collectors can earn a significant amount, with one reporting $95,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

This is an "insane" amount of money for playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

### Minor League Baseball Player
Minor league baseball players generally have low pay, typically $2,000 per month for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. There is no guarantee of moving up to the major leagues, as the percentage of players who make it is "astronomically small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. This path requires a "plan B" due to its low pay and high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

### Corporate Development
One individual reported a salary of $350,000 in "corporate development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.

### Options Investor
An options investor reported earning $125,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. While potentially lucrative, options trading carries significant risk, and one can lose money quickly if not knowledgeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

### USPS Package Handler
A package handler for the United States Postal Service earns $34.23 an hour plus benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. These benefits are notably good, including healthcare, a pension (rarely offered nowadays), and six weeks of paid vacation, likely indicating long tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

### 911 Operator
A 911 operator earns $28 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. This is considered a high-stress job that is not for everyone due to the urgency and types of encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.

### Animator (Video Games)
An animator with 16 years of experience in video games makes $28 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. This rate is significantly lower than that of a video game bug tester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

### Social Worker
A social worker reported an annual salary of $46,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.

Supplementing income with [[exploring_alternatives_to_traditional_9_to_5_employment_and_the_role_of_side_hustles | side hustles]] might be necessary for social workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

When experiencing a challenging job search, many individuals consider the contract route as an alternative to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there can be a stigma associated with contract positions, viewing them as "lower quality" or "just temporary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, it's beneficial to understand how [[recruiter_perspective_on_resume_writing | recruiters]] and hiring managers perceive these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The speaker, a corporate [[recruiter_perspective_on_resume_writing | recruiter]] with over 20 years of experience, shares insights into how organizations look at contracting and offers a career coach perspective on how job seekers should view these opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Pros of Contract Positions

### Increased Availability
Contract positions are more readily available, especially in uncertain economic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Companies may be apprehensive about adding permanent headcount but still need work done, leading to a higher prevalence of contract roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This means a higher likelihood of being considered for a contract position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Opportunity to Demonstrate Skills & Reduce Employer Risk
Contract roles offer candidates a chance to demonstrate their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. From an employer's perspective, a contract position reduces risk, particularly if a candidate is considered a "stretch" or if the role requires a niche skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. [[Understanding recruiter and hiring manager dynamics | Hiring managers]] are often risk-averse, as they have to "live with the headcount" and are nervous about making poor hiring decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

A common strategy for [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiters]] when [[challenges_faced_by_recruiters_in_hiring_processes | struggling to fill a role]] is to suggest a contract, allowing the candidate to prove themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If the contractor performs well, they can potentially be converted to a full-time employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Job seekers should ask during interviews about the likelihood of conversion, as this can indicate whether the contract was created to mitigate hiring risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Career Pivot and Skill Development
Contracting allows individuals to pivot into a new industry, job type, or gain new skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For example, if your area is dominated by specific industries, a contract can help you gain experience in that field and [[recruiter_perspective_on_resume_writing | pivot your resume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This is a strategic way to fill skill gaps on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Income Continuity
A contract position can provide continued income while actively searching for a full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This "buys more time" in a job search that can often take six to nine months or even up to a year, especially given that unemployment benefits run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### "Test Drive" for Candidates
Just as companies can test drive candidates, a contract position allows candidates to "test drive" the company, the work environment, and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If the fit is poor, you can "cut bait just as easily as the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Confidence Boost
For those who have been laid off, a contract position can help boost confidence, get them back into the workforce, and establish a routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. It's often easier to find a job when you already have a steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Potentially Higher Hourly Pay
In many cases, contract positions can offer a higher hourly rate compared to the equivalent full-time role, sometimes significantly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. While this comes with a lack of benefits and security, some individuals can earn enough to take extended breaks between contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Cons of Contract Positions

### "Hopping Resume" Perception
A significant drawback is the risk of developing a "hopping resume" if you take too many short-term contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Hiring managers often express concern when a candidate has worked only six, eight, or nine months at various places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

> "If they don't have commitment to a long-term project to see it through and go through the step change and the process improvement they're not going to be successful in my group. I want somebody that has buy-in to that stuff and is buy-in to the projects that they're working in and can build those relationships." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>

Short-term contractors may not build the same long-term relationships as full-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This can be a significant bias or misconception to fight, particularly for those relatively early in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Lack of Benefits
In most cases, contract positions do not offer benefits like health insurance or retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While some agencies may offer benefits, a large corporation's full-time benefits package is typically superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Sense of Limbo and Lack of Security
Being on contract can create a sense of limbo, feeling like your life is on pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. You may still need to actively look for permanent positions and plan for what happens when the contract ends, especially if it doesn't convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This lack of stable income can weigh heavily on major life events like buying a house or having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Employer's Lack of Full Commitment
Contractors are often aware that the employer is not fully committed to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. There are typically no career opportunities or a sense of loyalty and commitment from the employer's part in a straightforward contract role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Not Feeling Part of the Team
A temporary status can lead to not feeling fully integrated into the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. While involved in ongoing projects, contractors may feel like they won't be there to see future developments, fostering a sense of not belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, the decision to pursue a contract or full-time position depends on individual preferences, the current state of the job market, and how frequently job opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. While contracting offers many advantages, especially in difficult job markets, it's crucial to weigh the [[the_pitfalls_of_contract_offers_over_full_time_positions | potential pitfalls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Considering contract positions can be a strategic move in a challenging job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), also referred to as a Performance Improvement Process, is typically a last resort action taken by an HR department for performance-related issues within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### What a PIP Entails
A PIP defines a specific period during which an employee must meet measurable goals to retain their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The metrics set within a PIP are usually very clear, allowing for objective measurement of whether the goals were achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Implications of a PIP
*   **Consequence of Failure**
    If an employee goes through a PIP and does not meet the specified metrics, the end result is generally termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Opportunity for Improvement**
    However, if the employee takes the PIP seriously and genuinely improves their performance, they can successfully come off the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. After coming off a PIP, it becomes the employee's responsibility to continue elevating their performance to align with the rest of the team and distance themselves from their prior period of poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Why a PIP is Issued
A PIP is often part of a manager's process of documenting an employee's dismissal for HR purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. When a manager approaches HR about an underperforming employee they wish to terminate, HR professionals will typically review the employee's file, including recent performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. If an employee's work history is suddenly documented as not meeting expectations, it can appear to be a rash decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. To limit liability, HR often requests that managers start documenting coaching sessions and reflecting performance issues in appraisals, thereby creating a paper trail to defend any adverse employment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Taking a PIP Seriously
Being placed on a PIP is considered a significant red flag and should be approached with extreme seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. If an employee finds themselves in this situation, they should begin to consider their next steps, whether that involves a concerted effort to address the performance issues or to pursue a career change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Taking action is crucial to either salvage the current situation or move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

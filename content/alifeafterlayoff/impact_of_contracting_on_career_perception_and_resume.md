When engaged in a job search without much success, individuals often consider whether the contract route is a viable decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many may initially avoid contract positions, viewing them as lower quality or believing there's a stigma attached to them, as they can feel temporary rather than a full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This article will explore the [[pros_and_cons_of_contracting_versus_fulltime_work | pros and cons of contracting versus full-time work]] from a recruiter's and career coach's perspective, focusing on its impact on career perception and your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Recruiters' View on Contract Positions
As a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, the speaker notes that recruiters [[recruiters_perspective_on_contract_positions | look at contracting]] as a way for companies to get work done without adding permanent headcount, especially in uncertain economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Benefits of Contracting for Your Career & Resume

### Demonstrating Skills and Reducing Employer Risk
Contract positions are often more readily available, especially in fluctuating markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They offer a chance for candidates to demonstrate their skills to an employer who might be apprehensive or consider the candidate a "stretch" for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. From an employer's perspective, a contract position carries less risk for the hiring manager, as it allows them to see if an individual can perform well before committing to a full-time hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. If a hiring manager suggests a contract, it could be a strategy to mitigate risk and be less "picky" about candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It's a good question to ask during an interview if there's a likelihood of conversion to full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Pivoting & Skill Acquisition
Contract roles can be strategic for:
*   **Pivoting into new industries or job types**: For example, gaining experience in healthcare if your background is manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This allows you to "pivot your resume" and gain experience in a new field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Gaining new skill sets**: If you have gaps in required software skills or other competencies, a contract position can help fill those gaps on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This is a strategic way to sell yourself more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Other Advantages
Contracting can also:
*   Provide a continuation of income while searching for a full-time position, bridging financial gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Allow you to "test drive" a company or work environment to see if it's a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   Boost confidence and help re-establish a routine, especially after a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   Potentially offer higher hourly pay compared to a full-time role, which some contractors leverage to take breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This higher pay often comes with a lack of benefits and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Drawbacks of Contracting on Perception & Resume

### Risk of a "Hopping Resume"
One of the biggest concerns for career contractors, especially those seeking full-time roles, is developing a "hopping resume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Hiring managers frequently express concern about candidates who have consistently worked short-term contracts (e.g., six to nine months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. They look for candidates with commitment to long-term projects, process improvement, and the ability to build relationships, which are often difficult to achieve in short-term contract roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. If you are relatively early in your career, getting into career contracting too soon could lead to this "hopping resume" perception, which you might need to actively fight against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Lack of Commitment and Belonging
*   **No long-term employer commitment**: Employers are not fully committed to contractors; there are typically no clear career opportunities or pathways within the company beyond potential conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This lack of loyalty or commitment from the employer can weigh on a contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Feeling outside the team**: Contractors can feel a sense of not belonging to the team, knowing they are temporary. Discussions about future projects or forecasts may feel irrelevant because the contractor assumes they won't be there to see them through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Financial and Lifestyle Implications
*   **No benefits**: In most cases, contract positions do not offer benefits like those provided to full-time employees, although some agencies may offer limited benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Sense of limbo**: Contracting can create a feeling of being in limbo, especially if you're accustomed to full-time work. You might still need to actively look for permanent positions and plan for what happens when the contract ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This can impact major life events like buying a house or having children, which typically require stable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, deciding between contract and full-time work involves weighing the pros and cons based on personal preference, the current job market, and how frequently job offers are being received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. For many, contracting can be a sensible choice, while others might prefer to continue seeking a full-time, stable role despite the challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

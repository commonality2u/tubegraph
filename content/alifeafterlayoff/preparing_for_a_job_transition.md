When considering a job transition, it's crucial to approach the process with grace and professionalism to protect your professional reputation and future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises on the most proper way to quit a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Reasons for Leaving
Individuals often decide to leave a job for various reasons, such as a promotional opportunity, a desire to further their career, or to escape a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Regardless of the motivation, the goal should always be to leave with dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Wrong Way to Quit
Quitting a job dramatically, such as storming out, kicking over a computer, or telling an employer "take this job and shove it," is strongly discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Such actions will likely result in:
*   Being ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Burning bridges with the employer and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Potentially damaging your reputation, making colleagues view you as a "loose cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Reducing the likelihood of future referrals from contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

While a spectacular exit might offer momentary satisfaction, the negative consequences for your long-term career are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Timing Your Departure
It is generally easier to [[strategies_for_finding_a_new_job | find a new job]] while you are still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Confidentiality:** Do not tell anyone at your current job that you are looking for new opportunities until you are ready to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If your boss finds out too soon, you might be out the door sooner than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Keep your job search discreet, even from close work friends, as rumors can spread and harm your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Secure the New Job:** Before giving notice, ensure all your "ducks are in a row" with the new employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This includes having:
    *   Drug screen results back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Background checks completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   References confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   A confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    It is rare, but job offers can be pulled if issues arise during pre-employment checks, leaving you without a job at either company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Employers for a new role will respect your desire to have all checks completed before giving notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Giving Notice Professionally
Once you have a confirmed start date for your new position, follow these steps:
1.  **Set a Meeting with Your Boss:** Schedule a face-to-face meeting or a video call to deliver your notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Avoid sending an email or text message for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
2.  **Keep it Concise and Professional:** Provide the minimum necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   State that you've accepted another opportunity that is the best move for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   Thank them for the opportunity and your time at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   Inform them you are giving your two weeks' notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Do NOT elaborate on negative reasons for leaving (e.g., bad boss, terrible job) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This can escalate emotions and serves no purpose as your decision is already made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Do not entertain counter offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
3.  **Be Courteous:** Take the high road and maintain a professional demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This means expressing gratitude for the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Managing Communications
*   **Boss First:** Always inform your boss directly before telling any colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. They should not hear about your departure through the grapevine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Transition Plan:** Once your boss is informed, ask them about the appropriate time to start sharing the news with your team and putting together a transition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Wait for their "green light" to ensure you follow proper protocol and leave a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Consider Colleagues and Clients:** Recognize that your departure will create additional workload for your co-workers and may impact clients or internal customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. When communicating your departure, use grace and be appreciative of their understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Last Day Huddle:** On your last day, if possible, gather your team or influential colleagues for a brief huddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Keep the reason for leaving generic and positive (e.g., "better opportunity," "better for my family") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Thank everyone sincerely for the great time and growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Avoid trashing the company or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Building Your Professional Network
A graceful exit helps in building and maintaining your professional network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Personal Thank You:** Contact individuals who were instrumental in your career (e.g., mentors, trainers, those who provided opportunities) and give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Connect Professionally:** Ask these individuals to join your professional network, such as connecting on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. These connections are powerful resources for future [[strategies_for_finding_a_new_job | career opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Leaving on bad terms can severely limit these networking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## The Importance of a Two Weeks' Notice
Providing two weeks' notice is a professional courtesy, even though there's no legal requirement for it in many places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Tie Up Loose Ends:** It allows you time to complete ongoing tasks and facilitate a smoother handover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Consider Coworkers:** Primarily, it's a courtesy to your colleagues and boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. It prevents them from having to scramble to pick up your workload, reassign tasks, and ensure customer support is not disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. It's not their fault you're leaving, so being considerate of them is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Leaving a Lasting Impression
Maintaining positive relationships and leaving on good terms are vital for your "employment brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Future Opportunities:** If things don't work out with your new opportunity, you might want to consider returning to a previous employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Keep the door cracked open by asking if you could be considered for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **References:** Your former bosses will likely be needed as references for future jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Ensuring you are on good terms with them and that your performance was acceptable is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Networking:** Former bosses or colleagues might move to new companies and could potentially call you for future roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Burning bridges limits these possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Your professional conduct when leaving an organization reflects on you and will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Always aim to leave a great impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Interviewing can be challenging, especially when confronted with questions that seem simple but are actually traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A key area where these "trap questions" emerge is around [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## The Salary Expectation Trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>

Questions like "What's your current salary?" or "What are your [[understanding_compensation_packages_in_salary_negotiation | salary expectations]]?" can be a trap designed to lock you into a lower offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
Sharing your current salary can lead to a lowball offer, or you might be leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Conversely, stating a high expectation might scare off the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Legality of Salary History Questions
Some states prohibit the question "What's your current salary?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. If this question arises, it's advisable to deflect it and focus on the role's value, putting the onus back on the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Strategies for Answering Salary Expectation Questions

When asked about your [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_interviews | salary expectation]], it's crucial to answer strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>:

1.  **Ask them first**: Start by asking the employer if they can share the salary range for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
2.  **Provide a range**: If they insist you go first, provide your minimum acceptable salary plus 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   **Defining "minimum acceptable"**: This is the lowest amount you would need to feel good about the job offer and not immediately continue looking for other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
3.  **Conduct salary research**: Before the interview, perform thorough salary research to understand market rates for similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
4.  **Be realistic about your value**: Objectively assess what you truly bring to the table in terms of skills and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
5.  **Reclaim control**: Aim to control your career by determining your worth, rather than letting the company dictate your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. If a company lowballs you, be prepared to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Why You Must Provide a Number

Avoiding the salary question or "kicking the can down the road" is likely to result in being rejected or placed in limbo until a number is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Employers typically won't waste their hiring teams' and executives' time if there's a significant [[mismatch_between_job_expectations_and_compensation | mismatch between job expectations and compensation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Similarly, you don't want to invest time in an interview process only to discover a large discrepancy in [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

By preparing your answers, practicing, and delivering them clearly and confidently, you can show your value and navigate these questions successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Resources like jobseeker boot camps and interview crash courses can further assist in [[strategies_for_salary_negotiation | negotiating salary expectations]] and overall interview performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

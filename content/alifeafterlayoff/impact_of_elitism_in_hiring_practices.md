Job seekers often feel that employer requirements are out of touch, and there is evidence to support this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A phenomenon known as "hidden job requirements" contributes to this frustration, stemming from internal selection guidelines that are not publicly disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Unveiling Hidden Requirements

A recruiter accidentally emailed a technical candidate their secret internal selection guidelines, which were established by the hiring authorities, typically the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This internal memo, intended for the recruiter and not the job candidate, revealed a stark contrast to the public job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The candidate expressed feeling "pissed off" by the "sheer pretentiousness and elitism" of these guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Source of Bias

These hidden requirements often originate from the [[hiring_manager_indecisiveness_and_its_impact_on_job_candidates | hiring manager]] or the hiring team, rather than the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While a skilled recruiter *should* challenge unrealistic demands, this often doesn't happen, especially with less experienced recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The internal notes from a hiring manager's intake call detail a "wish list" beyond the standard "must-have" and "nice-to-have" requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. These "preferred" traits can often be interpreted as [[age_bias_in_the_hiring_process | hiring manager bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Specific Elite Requirements Revealed

The leaked internal guidelines for a software development role illustrate extreme examples of elitism:

*   **Educational Background**
    *   **University:** Must be a university graduate with a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   **Top Programs:** Degrees must be from "top programs" like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, or the University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   **Exceptions:** A "special exception" might be made for 4.0 GPA graduates from other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Avoid:** Graduates of coding boot camps (e.g., Full Stack Academy, Hacked Reactor) are not considered capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

*   **Experience Level and Type**
    *   **Years of Experience:** Requires 4 to 10 years of software development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Even a "genius" with two years of experience is not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Longevity in Role:** Candidates must show longevity, with two or more years in each role, effectively disqualifying "job hoppers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This means candidates laid off due to company closure or economic changes are not a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   **Startup Experience:** Significant experience in "notable" startups (e.g., Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital-backed) is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   **Large Company Experience:** Candidates who have only worked for large companies, even prominent ones like Google or Facebook, will be rejected because they are perceived as not understanding how to code in a startup environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Candidates *must* have startup experience paired with any large company experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   **Founding Experience:** Bonus points are given for being a founding engineer or having founder experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   **Avoid:** Career contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> and those with only a consulting background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> are not considered to have the necessary competency.

*   **Technical Expertise:** Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), sometimes modern tech like Kotlin, and knowledge of AI and machine learning are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

*   **Demographics & Background**
    *   **Diversity:** Diversity hires (e.g., Black, female) are considered a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   **Citizenship:** Must be a US citizen, US permanent resident (green card holder), or Canadian citizen. No visa sponsorships are permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

*   **Blacklisted Companies:** Candidates who have *ever* worked for companies like Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell are considered a "scarlet letter" and will "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Common Mistakes
> The hiring manager also included basic requests for recruiters, such as screening for fake profiles, which is considered "base level stuff" for a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The prevalence of fake scam profiles, especially with AI-driven applications, is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers and Companies

The presence of such unrealistic and hidden requirements leads to significant frustration for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. These practices contribute to the perception that getting a job in today's market is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

For recruiters, such a wish list makes their candidate pool "that much more difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Companies with these requirements are likely to struggle filling positions because they will "never find a qualified candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This highlights the [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | challenges in hiring and recruitment]] posed by overly stringent and biased criteria.

## Advice for Job Seekers

When encountering such [[high_competition_and_selective_hiring_processes | selective hiring processes]], job seekers should remember that "it's them and not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. It's not worth losing sleep over unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Strategies to mitigate the [[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | impact of the hiring process on job seekers]] include:
*   Presenting a clean, direct resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   Engaging in targeted networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Showcasing skills through platforms like GitHub or a portfolio website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

Job seekers can also choose not to apply for jobs with ridiculous requirements, forcing companies to adjust their approach if they receive no qualified candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This act of reclaiming control in one's career is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

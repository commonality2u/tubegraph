While employers may exhibit [[signs_of_low_quality_employers | red flags]], job seekers should also consider if their own behavior might be problematic, particularly if they are consistently rejected from positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Identifying and adjusting these behaviors can help candidates secure their next role with conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Common behavioral [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags]] observed by recruiters during interviews include:

## Lack of Professionalism

Interviewers often perceive a lack of professionalism as a significant [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Signs of this can include:
*   **Being overly comfortable** Some candidates become too relaxed during an interview, using informal language like "boss" or "bro," putting their feet on the desk, using colorful language, or telling off-color jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Such behavior indicates a lack of professionalism and disrespect for the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Poor Treatment of Support Staff

A sure sign that a candidate might be a [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] is when they treat individuals who are not directly interviewing them poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This can include:
*   **Front desk staff** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>
*   **Facility tour guides** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
*   **Recruiting coordinators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

If a candidate is aggressive, belittling, or difficult with these individuals, it will likely be reported back to the hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Such reports can lead to the candidate being removed from the interview process, as it suggests how they might behave as a team member, especially in senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. It is crucial to treat everyone encountered during the hiring process with the highest degree of respect, as they may influence hiring decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Lack of Accountability

Another [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] is a candidate who never takes accountability for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. During behavior-based interview questions, if answers consistently blame others when things go wrong and demonstrate no learning from mistakes, employers will perceive this negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Employers look for candidates who take ownership of issues and apply lessons learned to avoid repeating errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

The current job market has seen significant shifts, including a major change in who bears the primary responsibility for hiring within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This dynamic has resulted in increased challenges for job seekers.

## Shifting Hiring Burden

A key development in the labor market is the reduction in talent acquisition staff, meaning there are fewer recruiters available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Consequently, a substantial portion of the hiring burden has shifted to [[Recruiter and Hiring Manager Responsibilities | hiring managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

[[Recruiter and Hiring Manager Responsibilities | Hiring managers]] are already facing significant pressure:
*   Their teams have often been downsized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   They retain the same workload with fewer people to complete it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Recruiting is a full-time job, which many [[Recruiter and Hiring Manager Responsibilities | hiring managers]] are now discovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   They are often untrained in recruiting practices and may not want to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Impact on the Hiring Process

The shift in responsibility from recruiters to [[Recruiter and Hiring Manager Responsibilities | hiring managers]] has several negative consequences for the hiring process and [[Candidate experience and job market challenges | candidate experience]]:

*   **Slower Processes**
    Hiring processes have become significantly slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Poor Processes**
    There's an increase in "poor processes" because there aren't enough dedicated staff to facilitate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Lack of Advocacy**
    While opinions on recruiters may vary, they traditionally serve as an advocate for the hiring process, managing candidates through each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Without them, processes tend to slow to a near halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Reduced Efficiency**
    Smooth scheduling of interviews, quick progression through processes, and timely feedback on interviews have all become much more challenging for the average job seeker due to the lack of dedicated resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

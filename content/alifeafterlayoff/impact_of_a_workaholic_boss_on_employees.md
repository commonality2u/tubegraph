A workaholic boss is a type of [[types_of_bad_bosses_in_the_workplace | bad boss]] characterized by extreme dedication to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. They are typically the first to arrive and the last to leave the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. A clear sign of a workaholic boss is if they send emails during the weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>.

While dedication to work is not inherently negative, the issue arises when a workaholic boss expects the same level of dedication from their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>. This expectation is particularly common when the boss is also the owner of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:26">[03:25:26]</a>. As stated by GaryVee, employees will generally not be as dedicated to the company's mission as the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:09">[03:28:09]</a>.

## Consequences for Employees

If an employee finds themselves in an environment led by a workaholic boss and it does not align with their desired work-life balance, it may be necessary to seek a different career opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:07">[03:39:07]</a>. Being in a [[impact_of_a_toxic_work_environment_on_career_and_health | toxic situation]] or simply an undesirable work situation should not be tolerated just for the sake of having a steady job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

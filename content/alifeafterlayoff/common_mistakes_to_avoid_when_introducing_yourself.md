## [[Common Interview Mistakes | Common Mistakes to Avoid]] When Introducing Yourself

When answering "Tell me about yourself," it's important to understand what *not* to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Avoiding these [[Common Interview Mistakes | pitfalls]] can significantly improve your chances of success.

### Rehashing Your Resume
> [!WARNING]
> Do not go line by line through your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The interviewer can read your resume, and they will ask specific questions about your background later in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Save the detailed specifics for when you are prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Giving a Life Summary
> [!WARNING]
> Stick to the script and keep your answer related to the position you are interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Resist the temptation to recount your entire life story, including overcoming childhood adversity, European adventures, or personal hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This is not the appropriate time for such details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Rambling
> [!WARNING]
> Keep your answer concise, ideally between three to five minutes, or even two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Long-winded answers are often considered the "kiss of death" in interviews and should be avoided at all costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Ramble too long, and you risk ending up in the "no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. If you find yourself rambling, cut to the chase and wrap up your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Highlighting Unrelated Information
> [!WARNING]
> Do not highlight things that are not directly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

For instance, skip mentioning a side hustle as a personal trainer if it's irrelevant to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Instead, focus on demonstrating why you are a great fit and genuinely interested in *this specific* position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Sounding Robotic
> [!WARNING]
> While it's important to be concise and prepared, avoid sounding overly scripted or robotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Speak in your own voice, maintaining a natural flow while summarizing your experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

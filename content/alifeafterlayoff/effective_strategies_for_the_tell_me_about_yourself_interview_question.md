This article provides best practices for answering the common interview question, "Tell me about yourself," or "[[introducing_yourself_in_a_job_interview | introduce yourself in an interview]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Insights come from a corporate recruiter, HR professional, career coach, and hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Mastering this initial response can set a positive tone for the rest of your interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Understanding the Question

The "tell me about yourself" question often causes anxiety because it's ambiguous, offering a "massive blank slate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It's not merely an icebreaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>; it's an opportunity to demonstrate your suitability for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

At its core, this question aims to answer two main things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
1.  **Competency:** Do you have the skills to perform the job? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
2.  **Motivational Fit:** Are you a good motivational fit for the role? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

This is one of the first questions you'll be asked, making it your chance to shine and set a favorable tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## What Not to Say

When formulating your response, it's crucial to avoid certain pitfalls:

*   **Don't Rehash Your Resume:** The interviewer can read your resume for details about past jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Specific questions about your background will come later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Don't Give a Life Summary:** Stick to information relevant to the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Avoid personal stories, childhood adversity, travel adventures, or hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Don't Ramble:** Be concise. Keep your answer to three to five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Long-winded answers are considered a "kiss of death" and should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Don't Highlight Unrelated Things:** Skip discussions of side hustles or experiences not directly pertinent to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Focus on why you are a great fit and interested in *this* position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

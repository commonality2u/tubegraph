Identifying [[characteristics_of_predatory_hiring_practices | poor quality employers]] and [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | undesirable job opportunities]] is crucial in a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some employers engage in [[gaslighting_and_predatory_practices_by_employers | downright predatory practices]] that job seekers should learn to identify and avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Examples of Predatory Hiring Practices

### Publicly Blaming Employees
A gas station displayed a sign stating, "We are closed due to Alex walking out. We apologize about the inconvenience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This public display by the leadership team was criticized as childish and likely indicative of a toxic workplace, possibly due to issues with pay or treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Stagnant Wages and Loyalty Components
An educational for-profit corporation introduced a "loyalty component" into its instructional aide pay structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This system offered a mere 50-cent raise after five years of employment, with subsequent 50-cent raises every five years, totaling only a $3 increase over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This rate does not keep pace with inflation, which at 3% would require nearly $14/hour after five years just to maintain purchasing power, compared to the $12.50 offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Additionally, a "higher hourly rate *may* be considered" for staff with Master's degrees at the superintendent's discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Unpaid "Equity-Only" Positions
A startup called Salty Llama sought a Shopify Web Development Manager for seven hours per week in exchange for up to 0.25% equity, explicitly stating no salary or freelancer fee would be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The company indicated funds were reserved for marketing and scaling, with a vague promise of a potential "full-time position and a generous salary" if the company grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This is described as an "empty promise," as the chances of such a company going public and the equity becoming valuable are extremely low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Such offers are considered akin to working for free, and possibly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Ghost Jobs and Excessive Interview Processes
A company named Canonical (or Canon a Call) posted identical job openings, specifically for a "Talent Selection Lead," across multiple geographic locations (e.g., San Diego, Charlotte) without specific job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This practice, often seen in [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | ghost jobs]], indicates an inability to attract or retain candidates, or a lack of genuine openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Furthermore, a candidate for a Senior Linux Support Engineer role at Canonical received an outreach detailing an extraordinarily rigorous and bizarre interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. The steps included:
1.  **Initial Application Review** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>
2.  **Written Interview**: A prepared statement covering interests, priorities, experience, and ambition, designed to screen candidates out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. The statement required answers to numerous questions, many focusing on high school and university experiences for a senior-level role, which is seen as "bizarre" and "weird" for a senior position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
3.  **Standardized Personality and Aptitude Tests** (plural) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
4.  **Introductory Interview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
5.  **Technical Take-Home Test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
6.  **Technical Interview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
7.  **Leadership Interviews** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

This multi-stage process demands several hours of an applicant's uncompensated time before even speaking to a hiring manager, and is described as "ridiculous" rather than merely "rigorous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. It suggests that the recruiter is employing a "lazy way" to screen out candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

### Unpaid Internships for Established Companies
Turf Envy, a company with 11-50 employees, posted an unpaid Human Resources Specialist virtual internship, framing it as an investment in the applicant's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The post used "cringy" analogies like "superheroes" and "Avengers" to describe the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. Such unpaid roles are seen as an insult, particularly if the individual has self-respect and expects compensation for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### Recruiters Who Enjoy Rejecting Candidates
A LinkedIn post by a recruiter stated, "as a recruiter I get the most joy out of rejecting candidates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. This mentality is criticized as narcissistic and psychopathic, as most recruiters find rejecting candidates to be the "least favorite part of the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. A valuable recruiter aims to place the right people in the right roles and finds satisfaction in offering jobs that lead to positive career changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Poor Quality Employers

These examples serve as indicators of [[characteristics_of_predatory_hiring_practices | poor quality employers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Job seekers should prioritize companies that:
*   Value their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   Treat them properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   Respect their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   Pay them properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

Building a strong [[predatory_job_postings_and_scams_on_linkedin | LinkedIn presence]] can also attract recruiters and avoid these pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

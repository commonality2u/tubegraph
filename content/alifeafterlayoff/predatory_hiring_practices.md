From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

Predatory hiring practices are characterized by employers offering "cringe-worthy" opportunities that are often less than desirable, sometimes even exploitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The goal of identifying these practices is to help job seekers focus their efforts on better quality opportunities that value and properly compensate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

## Identifying Predatory Employers: Red Flags

Several indicators can help job seekers identify [[identifying_predatory_job_postings | poor quality employers]] and avoid [[avoiding_predatory_job_offers | predatory job offers]]:

### Publicly Shaming Employees

*   **Example: Racetrack Gas Station**
    *   A sign was posted on the front door stating, "We are closed due to Alex walking out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This public shaming reflects childish behavior from leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Such actions suggest a toxic workplace where employees may not be paid or treated correctly, leading to high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Unreasonable Compensation and "Loyalty Components"

*   **Example: Educational Establishment**
    *   A school announced a new hourly pay rate for instructional aides starting at $12, which is significantly low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
    *   Raises included a "loyalty component," offering only a 50-cent raise after five years of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   This raise is insufficient to keep pace with inflation; for instance, 3% inflation over five years would require an increase to nearly $14/hour just to maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   An individual working for 30 years would only receive a total of a three-dollar-an-hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   A "higher hourly rate" for master's degrees was discretionary, implying minimal or no additional compensation for advanced education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Unpaid Work and Deceptive Equity Offers

[[unpaid_work_and_unethical_hiring_practices | Unpaid work]] is a significant red flag, often disguised with promises of equity or "experience."

*   **Example: Salty Llama (Shopify Web Development Manager)**
    *   This startup sought a Shopify web development manager for seven hours a week in exchange for equity, explicitly stating they could not pay any salary or freelancer fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   The offer was up to 0.25% equity in a pre-IPO company that was literally a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   They dangled the empty promise of a "generous salary" and full-time position upon company growth, but the chances of the company going public and the equity becoming valuable were considered almost nil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   Working for free in exchange for uncertain equity is often illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Example: Turf Envy (Human Resources Specialist)**
    *   This small company (11-50 employees) posted an unpaid virtual internship for an HR Specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
    *   The posting deceptively framed it as an investment in one's future and a way to "jump start your career" by learning new skills for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
    *   Job seekers are advised to have self-respect and get paid for their services, as such unpaid roles offer very little career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
    *   Using terms like "fun at work," "superheroes," and referencing "the Avengers" in a lawn care company's job posting is seen as cringeworthy and a red flag for a serious opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

### Excessively Rigorous or Disorganized Hiring Processes

[[preparing_for_interviews_and_misleading_practices | Interview preparation]] can be futile if the employer's process is designed to be overly burdensome.

*   **Example: Canonical (Talent Selection Lead / Senior Linux Support Engineer)**
    *   **Geographic Spamming**: Posting the same position across a wide geographic area (e.g., San Diego, Charlotte) indicates the company struggles to find candidates, has poor candidate flow, or cannot get people through their interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   **Templated Job Descriptions**: The company posted job descriptions showing their internal template, including placeholders like "Job Summary," "Title must appear," "five to ten bullet points key responsibilities," and "recruiter adds additional benefits if applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This signals extreme disorganization and a lack of effort in attracting candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
    *   **Overly Complex Interview Process**: For a Senior Linux Support Engineer role, the process included:
        1.  Initial application review (completed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
        2.  Written interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
        3.  Standardized personality tests and aptitude tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
        4.  Introductory interview (first actual conversation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
        5.  Technical take-home test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
        6.  Technical interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
        7.  Leadership interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
    *   This "rigorous" process is considered ridiculous, requiring hours of unpaid time from candidates (2-3 hours before even speaking to a hiring authority) with no guarantee of an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
    *   The "written interview" was a prepared statement covering interests, priorities, experience, and ambition, acting as a self-screening mechanism for the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
    *   The questionnaire included bizarre and irrelevant questions for a senior role, such as high school interests, university achievements, and ranking in one's degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This indicates a "weird [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]]" or someone unfamiliar with modern [[employer_hiring_strategies and ethics | talent acquisition practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Recruiters Who Enjoy Rejecting Candidates

*   A recruiter publicly stated on LinkedIn that they get "the most joy out of rejecting candidates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   This mindset is described as narcissistic and psychopathic, as no recruiter of value enjoys disappointing someone who has invested effort into a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   While closing the loop on candidates is important, finding joy in rejection is an extreme red flag about the recruiter's character and the company's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

## Avoiding Predatory Job Offers

To avoid predatory job offers and focus on quality opportunities, job seekers should:

*   **Seek Fair Compensation**: Ensure that the pay offered is proper and competitive for the role and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. Be wary of [[dangers_of_bait_and_switch_salary_tactics | bait and switch salary tactics]].
*   **Prioritize Respect**: Work with companies that respect your time and efforts throughout the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Identify Value**: Understand that good employers value their staff, treat them properly, and provide meaningful growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Be Skeptical of "Experience" Over Pay**: Recognize that genuine work should be compensated, and "experience" is not a substitute for fair pay, especially for substantial contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Research Company Culture**: Look for signs of a healthy work environment, as opposed to toxic or childish leadership.
*   **Evaluate Interview Processes**: A reasonable interview process should not demand excessive unpaid time or irrelevant information before an actual conversation.

For job seekers struggling to attract quality employers, resources are available to help craft effective resumes and prepare for interviews, ensuring they get noticed for legitimate opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

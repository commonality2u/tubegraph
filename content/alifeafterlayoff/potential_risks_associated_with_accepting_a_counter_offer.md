While a counter offer from your current employer might seem flattering, it often comes with significant [[potential_risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | potential risks]] that can negatively impact your career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. A career coach often advises caution against accepting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

## Case Study: A Real-Life Scenario

A Reddit user shared a scenario where they accepted a job offer and tendered their resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. This new opportunity was a lateral move to a non-competing company, offering a 30% pay bump for similar work but with expanded responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. This expansion meant gaining more experience and building a stronger resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>. The user's gut feeling indicated this was the best course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:37">[02:27:37]</a>.

Upon resigning, their current employer suddenly surfaced "big plans" and asked what it would take to keep them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. This unexpected response, often coming from senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:43">[02:57:43]</a>, prompted the user to consider how to navigate these conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:08">[04:19:08]</a>. The general advice is to keep details of the new offer confidential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:06">[04:47:06]</a>.

## Reasons to Decline a Counter Offer

The expert highlights several [[reasons_to_decline_a_counter_offer_from_your_employer | reasons to decline a counter offer]] from your employer:

### The "Dangling Carrot" Syndrome
Employers often present future plans and opportunities, such as managing a new team, only after you resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>. This "proverbial carrot" is a common trap, keeping people in jobs too long with unfulfilled promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>. Such promises are often "talk is cheap" and may take a long time to materialize, if ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:14">[03:27:14]</a>.

### Prior Underappreciation
A sudden significant pay bump or new opportunities after you resign suggests that your current company either did not recognize your potential or took you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:05">[09:21:05]</a>. If you were not valued before, their sudden change might be a temporary measure to retain you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:01">[09:05:01]</a>.

### Increased Vulnerability for Layoffs
Accepting a counter offer often makes you a "more expensive version of the same" employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:42">[06:57:42]</a>. In the event of future layoffs, you might be the most expensive person in your department, making you a prime candidate for termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

### "Flight Risk" Label and Higher Expectations
Once you've played the "card" of having another offer, your employer may view you as a "flight risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Additionally, accepting a counter offer often means a "target on your back" and a higher level of expectation, even if you take on a new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:37">[07:15:37]</a>.

### Lack of Sincerity and Improvised Plans
Often, the counter offer isn't based on a genuine, long-term plan for your career growth. High-level executives, who may be out of touch with day-to-day operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:07">[15:56:07]</a>, might improvise a role or title without a clear job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:47">[16:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:08">[17:38:08]</a>. The focus is on what the company "can use" you for, rather than how they can help you grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:30">[16:51:30]</a>.

### Slow Career Advancement
If you were genuinely on a path for leadership or executive roles, you would typically already be part of a formal succession planning program, receiving development and mentoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:48">[12:08:48]</a>. If such programs exist and you weren't part of them before, a sudden promise of advancement is likely disingenuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:30">[12:30:30]</a>. Real progress in larger companies can take many years, often only occurring when someone retires or leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:07">[17:09:07]</a>.

### Past Behavior as a Predictor
How your company and boss have treated you and others in the past is the best indicator of how they will treat you in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:06">[13:12:06]</a>. If they only valued you when you were leaving, this pattern is likely to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:05">[13:18:05]</a>.

## Navigating Conversations and Final Decisions

When presented with a counter offer, it's advised to hear them out but be vague about the details of your new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>. Do not disclose salary or company names, as some employers might attempt to interfere with your new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:48">[04:57:48]</a>.

While there are rare exceptions where accepting a counter offer might be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:05">[18:21:05]</a>, the general consensus is that these [[considerations_when_contemplating_a_counter_offer | challenges faced when considering a counter offer]] usually outweigh any perceived benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:11">[18:02:11]</a>. In the Reddit user's case, after weighing the pros and cons, they ultimately decided not to accept the counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:20">[14:18:20]</a>.

You have no legal obligation to start a new job even after signing an offer letter, but it's important to act in your own best interest and be prepared for the new company to be upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:03">[07:59:03]</a>. It's crucial to act as the CEO of your own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:40">[08:41:40]</a>.

Maintaining professional relationships is important, so avoid burning bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:54">[09:55:54]</a>. If a leadership role was discussed, you could suggest they reach out when a concrete plan is in place and expect your seniority to be honored if you were to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:07">[10:05:07]</a>. When discussing reasons for leaving, avoid personal grievances or criticisms of your work quality; instead, frame it as being "pulled by an opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

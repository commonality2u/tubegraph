The inability or unwillingness of senior leaders to retire can have significant negative consequences for an organization and the careers of its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This situation can lead to stagnation, talent drain, and missed opportunities for career progression within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## A Personal Account of Stagnation

Brian, from A Life After Layoff, shares a personal story about his early career that highlights the dangers of senior leaders delaying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### The Unfulfilled Promise
Early in his career, Brian was recruited into a railroad services company of about 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. His role as Staffing and Development Manager was essentially a Human Resources Manager position, which offered "meaty" and impactful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The premise for accepting the job was the promise that he would learn the ropes from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was slated to retire in 18 months, after which Brian would be promoted to his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

The VP, described as having "an old school way" of managing HR, also possessed a "high degree of empathy for the employee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The company fostered a "family-oriented atmosphere" and offered a relatively laid-back environment with a high degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Leadership's Reluctance to Retire
A significant tier of leadership within the organization, including Brian's boss, was expected to retire within a two- to three-year window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. However, Brian's boss, along with many other senior leaders, continued working well past their anticipated retirement dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. It became evident after 18 months that his boss had "no true intention of hanging up the cleats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, largely because he had a "little kingdom that he ran" and significant influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

These senior leaders, who received "really nice bonuses every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, found it hard to let go of their "stranglehold on the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. They convinced themselves that no one was capable of taking over their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, with Brian's boss repeatedly telling him, "you're not ready yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Impact on Succession Planning and Talent
Brian was part of a "leadership development group" intended for succession planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. However, due to the prolonged tenure of senior leaders, most peers in this group "one by one started leaving the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. One peer even became a president at a competitor company, and another left after being passed over for promotion multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Ultimately, only one out of eight to ten people in that succession group made it to their intended level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

The senior leaders were not providing proper development opportunities, despite saying the right things to their faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Behind closed doors, they would claim the group wasn't ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Delayed Succession

The speaker's experience illustrates several critical impacts when senior leadership does not retire as expected:

*   **Apathy and Comfort:** Brian became "very apathetic" and "very comfortable" collecting a steady paycheck, failing to "push the way I should have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. He stopped caring about going "above and beyond" or being considered for promotion, entering "autopilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This comfort led him to stop making decisions in the best interest of his long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Stagnated Career Progression:** What was promised as an 18-month path turned into nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Brian "gave up on my dream of being the head HR person" after about seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. While his astute peers in the succession group left and advanced rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>, Brian remained stuck at a manager's level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. The repeated message of "you're not ready" caused him to doubt his own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Skill Obsolescence:** Brian stopped learning and keeping up with industry trends, latest technology, and buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This traditional company lacked budget for new developments and didn't value them, causing him to fall behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. When he re-entered the job market, he discovered he was behind his peer group in skills, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>, eventually having to take a step down in responsibility to gain new experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Setback:** The speaker realized he was "truly far behind the rest of the market" in compensation, which cost him "thousands and thousands of dollars in lost income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned: Act as the CEO of Your Career

Brian eventually left HR for a different role within the company for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, and his boss finally hired a replacement and left the organization nine years after his promised retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

The experience taught Brian that while he didn't regret working for the company, he regretted "how I handled my career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. He highlights the importance of:
*   **Taking Ownership:** Instead of waiting for opportunities or recognition, individuals must actively manage their career like a "chess player" with a plan and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Stagnation:** Staying too long in a comfortable role, as described in "why steady jobs bad for your career," can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Development:** Continuously learning and pushing for new skills is crucial, rather than waiting for employers to provide development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **Recognizing Red Flags:** When peers "take off" for better opportunities, it should serve as a warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **Testing the Open Market:** A "true CEO of their career" should consistently test the open market and entertain other opportunities to remain available for the best possible roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

This experience ultimately set Brian back "a decade" in his career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>, emphasizing that "we all have a runway in our career that shortens very quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

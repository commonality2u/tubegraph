When in a job interview, it's crucial to ask the hiring manager critical questions, as it demonstrates engagement and curiosity about the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Asking questions is a key part of [[job_interview_strategies_and_tips | job interview strategies and tips]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Why Ask Questions?

Based on over 20 years of experience as a corporate recruiter, hiring managers often dislike when candidates don't ask any questions, as it suggests a lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Beyond satisfying the interviewer's expectation of curiosity, candidates should be screening the company and the role simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Being selective about job roles is vital, as a poor job choice can set back a career for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The interview process is a two-way street, where candidates should be interviewing the company just as much as they are being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The best candidates often feel like they are interviewing the company more than the other way around, demonstrating an aggressive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Candidates can pick and choose which questions are most appropriate for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It's beneficial to ask questions throughout the interview, not just at the end, to create a two-way dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Key Questions to Ask a Hiring Manager

Here are ten questions to consider asking during an interview:

### 1. Why is this position open? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
This question provides insight into the department's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **If the previous person was terminated, laid off, or quit:** This signals potential issues worth exploring further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. If they quit due to job dissatisfaction, ensure the work aligns with your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If terminated, inquire about their areas of unsuccessfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **If it's an added headcount:** This usually indicates department or company growth, which is a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 2. What is your vision for this role? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

### 4. How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

### 8. What would you describe your leadership style as? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>

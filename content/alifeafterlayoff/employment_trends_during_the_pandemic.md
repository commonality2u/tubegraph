Recent years have seen a rapid succession of significant [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | employment trends]], beginning with the [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | great resignation]], followed by [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | quiet quitting]], then quiet firing, and most recently, career cushioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These trends reflect a constantly shifting [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | labor market]] where the power dynamic between employers and employees has swung back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Pendulum Swings: From Employer Dominance to Worker Power

The catalyst for these shifts was the major [[impact_of_economic_downturn_on_employment | economic downturn]] in 2020, resulting from the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Many employers reacted by laying off numerous employees, which in turn forced remaining staff to shoulder additional work burdens, leading to stress and long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. During this period, the prevailing sentiment was that employees should "just be happy to have a job," as [[impact_of_economic_downturns_on_job_availability | hiring]] had largely ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Employers also sought to maximize output while cutting expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

This intense period led to widespread burnout among workers, prompting many to reevaluate their careers and life priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Displaced workers questioned years of loyalty for an unceremonious exit, while those who remained questioned their career choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### The Great Resignation

This reevaluation culminated in the [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | great resignation]] wave, a significant [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | employment trend]] where employees began to step back and demand more from their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The "pendulum" of power, which had long been with the employer, swung forcibly towards the job seeker, creating an extreme "buyer's market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. During this "Heyday of job seeking," opportunities were abundant, people received raises frequently, and many left stable jobs for more lucrative or appealing roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Quiet Quitting and Quiet Firing

Following the [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | great resignation]], the concept of [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | quiet quitting]] emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This trend saw burned-out employees who, despite not wanting to leave their jobs, reduced their effort to meet only the minimum requirements, feeling less threatened by potential repercussions due to the robust job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

As the pendulum began to swing back towards a more neutral position, and employers started to regain power, another trend, [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | quiet firing]], became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This involved employers subtly encouraging employees to quit rather than outright firing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Current Job Market Shift (December 2022)

As of December 2022, the [[current_job_market_and_rising_layoffs | job market]] remains shaky, with the pendulum seemingly swinging further towards the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While the overall [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | labor market]] still shows signs of strength, specific industries, particularly [[trends_in_tech_job_market_and_layoffs | tech]], have been significantly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives revealed concerning trends:
*   Fifty percent of respondents are reducing their overall headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   Companies are streamlining their workforces, potentially due to over-hiring during previous booms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Indicators of a rocky [[signs_of_economic_cooldown_affecting_job_opportunities | 2023]] include [[impact_of_economic_changes_on_hiring | hiring]] freezes, reduced headcount, decreased sign-on bonuses, and 44% of companies rescinding offers or canceling jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Career Cushioning: Proactive Career Management

In response to these shifting [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | employment trends]], the latest concept to emerge is "career cushioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This involves proactively preparing for the possibility of job loss by taking steps to create a "safety net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Career cushioning can include:
*   Updating your LinkedIn profile and resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Researching current job postings to understand market demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Actively building professional networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Reaching out to recruiters for "soft feelers" or even beginning to apply for jobs without being in an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   Taking stock of career aspirations, current skills, and skill gaps to develop a plan for professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

This proactive approach ensures individuals are prepared for unexpected income disruption, acting as a "free agent" in their career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. While not a new concept, career cushioning is highly recommended to minimize the impact of market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

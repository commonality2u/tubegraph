Have you ever found yourself unable to get an interview or hired by a company, even if you're perfectly qualified, or even a former employee on good terms? You might be on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Companies like Meta have confirmed that they maintain such block lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Meta's "Do Not Hire" Lists

A recent Business Insider expos√© revealed that former Meta employees discovered they were blocked from rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This discovery often happened in unexpected ways, such as through hiring managers or third-party recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### The Engineer's Experience

One senior engineer, laid off during Meta's 2022 mass layoffs, which were initially not considered performance-based, found themselves unable to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Despite having "exceeding expectations" performance ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> and a promotion into a senior technical role a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, this engineer was told their layoff was "simply a business decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

After applying for nearly 20 positions over a year, the engineer noticed a pattern: hiring managers expressed interest and even set up screening calls with recruiters, but then recruiters would [[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | ghost them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Eventually, the hiring manager learned that the recruiting team had forbidden contact because the engineer was deemed ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Internal Mechanisms at Meta

Meta uses multiple internal systems to track rehire ineligibility, including a "non-regrettable attrition" designation and a "do not hire" flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means a former employee can be "scarlet lettered" without clear reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Manager Discretion

Despite Meta's official stance that there's clear criteria for being marked ineligible, former managers claim they had broad discretion to add names to the list without documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. It could take minutes for someone to be marked as "non-regrettable" simply if a manager didn't like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Broader Industry Practice

Most companies track rehire information, primarily in their HRIS (Human Resources Information System) rather than the applicant tracking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. When rehiring a candidate, the human resources department conducts due diligence to provide a "thumbs up or thumbs down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Recruiters are typically not privy to this flagging information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## How Candidates End Up on a Blacklist

### Formal Reasons

Common reasons for formal blacklisting include:
*   Violating workplace policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
*   Stealing confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Being an underperformer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   Reason for separation at the time of leaving (e.g., rage quitting without notice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
*   Performance termination or involuntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>

### Informal Reasons

Even if you did everything right, you could still be blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. As seen with Meta, manager discretion can lead to inclusion on a "do not hire" list, even without documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Impact of Layoffs
> Meta initially stated its 2022 layoffs were not performance-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, but later switched to declaring all future layoffs performance-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This policy change effectively "scarlet-lettered" many previously laid-off employees as poor performers, potentially biasing future hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Blacklisting for New Applicants (No Prior Employment)

It's also possible to be informally blacklisted by a company you've never worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Spamming Applications

Applying for a large number of diverse jobs at the same company (e.g., 30-40 applications, or even 150 over two years) can lead to an informal bias against you by staffing teams and hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. It makes you look "spammy," especially if the jobs are completely unrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

### Failing Interview Stages and Recycle Periods

Companies like Amazon have a "disposition status" assigned to candidates who go through interview "loops" but are unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Technical Skill Deficiency**: If you failed due to a technical skill or competency, you might have a "recycle period" (e.g., six months) before you can reapply for a different role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Leadership Principle Failure**: If you failed the "leadership principle" (behavior-based) interview, there was often no recycling period, effectively banning you permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## The Impact of Backdoor References

A "backdoor reference" occurs when someone on a hiring team contacts an acquaintance who worked at your previous company to get an unofficial opinion about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. These informal references can sink a candidate's chances and even lead to blacklisting, especially in small industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This practice happens behind the scenes, so you'll likely never know about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Identifying if You're Blacklisted

It's nearly impossible to know for sure if you're on a do not hire list because companies will not disclose it to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The most common way former employees find out is when a third-party recruiter or headhunting agency attempts to submit their candidacy and is informed by the company that the candidate is on a do not hire list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

When you are blacklisted, initial communication with a recruiter might be smooth, but once you interact deeper with the company, things slow down, communication becomes vague, and you eventually receive a random rejection letter without clear reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

While some employers actively use do not hire lists, it's not a widespread practice to lose sleep over, unless you specifically target large tech companies like Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The job market is vast, and it's more productive to focus on reclaiming control over your career rather than dwelling on a single company's potentially "ridiculous" policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

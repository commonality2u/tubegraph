Navigating your career can be challenging, and individuals are likely to make mistakes at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even experienced professionals, including the speaker, admit to having made several of these errors throughout their own careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The goal is to learn from these common pitfalls to avoid future pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Common Career Mistakes Learned the Hard Way

### 1. Unrecognized Critical Mistakes Early On
Many people make critical career mistakes early in their journey but don't realize the impact until years later, when it might be too late to easily change course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These can include:
*   [[creating_a_career_strategy_post_layoff | Staying in a job for too long]] or "overstaying your welcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Failing to respond to a recruiter about an amazing job opportunity due to fear or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   [[navigating_job_offers_and_employment_strategies | Accepting a job offer]] that wasn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Not moving for a potential career path, or moving to an unsuitable location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Focusing for too long on a specific job type or career vertical, only to realize it's not resonating later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Delaying a career change until it becomes significantly more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

These mistakes often become apparent during [[career_management_and_development | career coaching]] sessions, where a coach can pinpoint where an individual "went off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### 2. Loyalty Rarely Pays Off
One significant lesson learned is that company loyalty rarely benefits an individual's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. An example shared includes staying in a role for five years, expecting a promotion that never materialized because a senior leader delayed retirement indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This loyalty led to being left behind as peers advanced into leadership roles, resulting in a significant lag in both responsibility and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This highlights the importance of not being overly loyal and being aware of [[strategies_for_career_advancement_beyond_job_hopping | career advancement beyond job hopping]].

### 3. Hard Work Does Not Necessarily Lead to Promotions
While hard work is important, it's a mistake to believe that simply putting in long hours will guarantee promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The speaker recounts working 12+ hour days and weekends to impress a workaholic boss, only for the entire plant to shut down a year and a half later, leaving them without a promotion and needing to find a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

The key is not to work the most hours, but to work the smartest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This means:
*   Working on highly visible projects that matter to your boss and their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   [[career_advice_and_job_search_strategies | Advocating for yourself]] to the right people, specifically your boss's boss, as they are often the decision-makers for promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Acting as the "marketing department" for your own career, showcasing your effectiveness within your company and department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This aligns with [[career_management_and_being_a_free_agent | managing your career as a free agent]].

### 4. Relevant Skills Matter More Than Specific Expertise
Being exceptional at one specific skill can be an advantage, but employers value skills that are currently relevant and in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. If an employer no longer needs a particular skill, or if you move to a new company or industry that doesn't value it, you can find your resume full of irrelevant skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This can lead to settling for lower-quality jobs and issues on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The focus should be on developing widely demanded skills, not just those valued by a single employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### 5. You're Only as Good as What You've Done Lately
In the current climate of [[job_market_instability_and_frequent_layoffs | job market instability and frequent layoffs]], it's a painful reality that past achievements and "goodwill" built up with an employer are often short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Even major project successes or strong relationships might only buy a few months of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Senior leaders prioritize future contributions over past ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

This underscores the need to operate as the [[career_management_and_being_a_free_agent | free agent of your career]], always prioritizing your own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. It's not selfish to put yourself first in your career, especially when navigating a difficult job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Being the "CEO of your career" involves wearing multiple hats and strategically planning for your future, including continuous personal marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

By understanding these common pitfalls and adopting [[strategies_for_navigating_job_insecurity | proactive strategies for career navigation]], individuals can avoid significant pain and better control their professional trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

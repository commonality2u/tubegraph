The question "What's your salary expectation?" is a common and often dreaded part of the job interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Answering incorrectly or not at all can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, it's an important question for both the job seeker and the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Why Companies Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters typically ask about [[discussing_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectations]] towards the end of an interview, especially for candidates they are interested in moving to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The primary reason is to determine if the candidate's expectations align with the company's established [[understanding_market_value_for_job_roles | salary band]] for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This data is then included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

It's generally not a trick question; recruiters genuinely want to know a candidate's salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The goal is to ensure that if an offer is extended, the candidate will not only accept but also be excited about the position, feeling they received a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. If a candidate accepts a salary below their expectation, they are likely to be unsatisfied and seek other opportunities, leading to the employer needing to refill the position within a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

While some low-quality employers might try to lowball an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, a reputable employer's aim is often to ensure a mutually beneficial compensation agreement. If your realistic [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers | salary expectations]] deter them, it may indicate that the company isn't the right fit for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## The Role of Salary Bands

Major corporations operate with predefined [[components_of_a_comprehensive_compensation_package | salary bands]] for roles, outlining the minimum, midpoint, and maximum compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These bands are typically based on local market wage surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Another critical concept is **internal equity**, which aims to ensure that individuals in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This prevents situations where a new entry-level hire earns significantly more than an experienced employee in a comparable role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The talent acquisition and HR departments collaborate to establish reasonable [[factors_influencing_salary_decisions_in_job_offers | salary ranges]] for positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Scenarios Based on Salary Alignment

Companies navigate different situations based on how a candidate's expectations align with their [[evaluating_employer_quality_and_salary_offers | salary bands]]:

*   **Candidate's Salary Higher than Range**: If a candidate's expectation is too high, especially if it's significantly above the range (e.g., $25,000 apart), it's unlikely an offer will be made that meets their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, if the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000), some negotiation might occur, or the recruiter might propose alternative compensation scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For superstar candidates, recruiters might still present their resume and high expectations to the hiring manager, sometimes leading to the role being "enriched" or re-leveled to accommodate a higher salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This is an exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Candidate's Salary Lower than Range**: This is often a favorable situation for recruiters, as it allows them to offer a significant raise to the candidate, who will likely be excited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. If a candidate's expectation is below the lowest point of the company's range, their offer will automatically be adjusted up to that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This often occurs when candidates come from smaller companies or those that don't pay competitively on the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Refusing to Answer**: Avoiding the question or providing vague answers will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Recruiters need to know if a deal can be made, and ambiguity can suggest a candidate is hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. An interviewer will not put a candidate through the full process if they don't believe compensation can be agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Key Information for Candidates

To [[approaching_the_question_of_salary_expectations_in_interviews | effectively answer]] the salary expectation question, candidates need to know three major things:

1.  **Average Salary Range**: Research the average [[importance_of_knowing_average_salary_range_for_roles | salary range]] for the specific role in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Use resources like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com, ensuring to compare jobs in your local area to get realistic figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
2.  **Company's Expected Pay**: Understand what the company is expecting to pay for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom Line**: Determine your absolute minimum [[salary_and_benefits_evaluation | salary expectation]] â€“ the point at which you would walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This internal number doesn't necessarily need to be shared with the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Strategies for Answering the Salary Question

Once equipped with the necessary information, here are ways to approach the question:

*   **Simply State Your Expectation**: If you know your worth and are confident the company is in a similar ballpark, directly state your number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Ensure this number is reasonable and one you can commit to throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Frame with Market Research**: If you suspect the company might offer low or your expectation is high, frame your answer based on market research. For example: "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between $90,000 to $110,000. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> This puts the onus on the company to state their range.
*   **Put the Question Back on the Recruiter**: If you're concerned about pricing yourself out of an opportunity you're interested in, you can ask the recruiter for their range first: "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> Recruiters might often share this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Don't be Ambiguous
> Do not attempt to be ambiguous with your salary expectations, thinking you'll negotiate only at the offer stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This can annoy the hiring manager who has invested time, and it won't serve you well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. If a recruiter senses frustration due to your evasiveness, simply provide an answer to avoid being put in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

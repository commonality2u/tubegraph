Recruiters evaluate candidates quickly, and a strong [[importance_of_first_impressions_during_interviews | first impression]] is crucial for advancing in the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Role of Your Resume
Your resume serves as your primary, and often only, [[importance_of_first_impressions_during_interviews | first impression]] to a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Recruiters typically spend only about five seconds reviewing a resume before deciding whether to move a candidate to the "yes" or "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Once this initial impression is made, it's generally difficult to change the recruiter's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Revising an application after it has been dispositioned will not change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Therefore, having a solid resume that stands out is essential to cut through the large volume of often underqualified applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Initial Interview Assessment
During an interview, recruiters often determine if a candidate is a good fit within the first 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This gut feeling is typically formed by the second or third question asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Making a great [[importance_of_first_impressions_during_interviews | first impression]] early in the interview helps the recruiter confidently place you in the "yes" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

While it's not impossible to recover from a poor start, it is much harder to play catch-up later in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Candidates should come [[preparing_for_job_interviews | prepared]] and aim to impress the recruiter from the outset to increase their chances of moving to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Asking Questions
Questions asked at the end of an interview are generally too late to significantly influence a recruiter's decision, as their mind is often already made up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. If you are using questions to clarify information for yourself, that's fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. However, if the goal is to impress the interview team, it's more effective to ask insightful questions earlier in the process to position yourself as the best possible fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. It's challenging to convince a recruiter to move you from the "no" bucket back to "yes" based on a question asked at the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Navigating the path to [[promotions_and_internal_movement | promotions and internal movement]] in the workplace requires careful consideration of professional relationships and personal conduct. Various factors, including over-sharing, gossip, negativity, and the dynamics of workplace friendships, can impact one's upward mobility and credibility.

## The Pitfalls of Over-Sharing

A significant challenge in the workplace, particularly when aiming for or adapting to promotions, is the risk associated with over-sharing personal or professional opinions with colleagues. An HR professional recounted a personal experience where an innocent comment about a newly promoted, inexperienced supervisor named Joe led to misunderstandings and a damaged relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

After a social outing where the HR professional discussed Joe's development, a colleague twisted the conversation, reporting that the HR professional "didn't have any faith in [Joe] as a leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This incident led to a strained relationship with the new supervisor and a valuable lesson in discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

> "The moral of this story is I learned the hard way that you have to be very careful with people that you choose to be friendly with at work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Even seemingly innocent comments, when over-shared, can find their way back to management, creating a major credibility issue that can stunt long-term career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Maintaining a reputation of trustworthiness is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## The Impact of Gossip and Negative Associations

Gossiping is another pervasive issue in many offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Engaging in "water cooler talk" with individuals who enjoy stirring up drama and gossiping about others can easily lead to over-sharing or regrettable statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

> "You're going to be branded as an office gossip if you hang out with those people because here's the thing you are who you hang out with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Leadership teams are aware of who associates with "clicks" that engage in gossip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Being branded as a gossip can hinder upward movement within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The advice is to quickly get what you need and leave areas where gossip originates to avoid getting sucked into drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. HR professionals often find themselves diffusing employee relation situations stemming from office gossips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Furthermore, gossips tend to be negative individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Spending too much time with negative colleagues who constantly complain about management, company policies, or compensation can inevitably bring down one's own morale and focus on career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Negative people can act as "cancer" in a group, especially for those focused on upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## The Complications of Workplace Friendships and Social Events

Workplace friendships can become complicated, particularly when [[promotions_and_internal_movement | promotions]] are involved. A friendly relationship can become "uber competitive and quite awkward" if one person receives a promotion over another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. If a co-worker becomes a supervisor, past shared "dirty secrets" from water cooler conversations could compromise the new supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. An unscrupulous co-worker might even leverage such knowledge, holding the promoted individual "hostage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Jealousy from colleagues can also hold back one's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

Company happy hours and other out-of-work events with colleagues also present potential challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. When alcohol is involved, individuals can become "loose" with their words or actions, potentially crossing the fine line between camaraderie and harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Even an off-color joke could offend someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

> "Anything that you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

While it's possible to maintain friendships with co-workers, it's essential to pick friends carefully and be cautious about behavior, speech, and shared information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

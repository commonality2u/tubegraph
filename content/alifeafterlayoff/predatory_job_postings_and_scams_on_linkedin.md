LinkedIn, despite its status as the premier job search platform, has seen a rise in [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | predatory job postings]] and [[employment_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them | scam recruiters]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This trend creates significant challenges and can be devastating for job seekers, especially those who are unemployed and already under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Characteristics of Predatory Job Postings

Several types of [[characteristics_of_predatory_hiring_practices | predatory hiring practices]] and misleading job listings are prevalent on LinkedIn:

### Unpaid Opportunities
Some companies post unpaid opportunities for experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. These are sometimes disguised as internships or portfolio projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Evergreen Posts
Companies may use "evergreen posts" to collect resumes with no real intention of hiring anyone for those specific listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This practice, often referred to as [[role_of_deceptive_job_postings_like_pipelining_wrecks | pipelining]], leaves job seekers feeling used and demoralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Common Scams and Red Flags

The platform is also rife with direct scams:
*   **Fake Recruiters and Jobs** The site contains fake recruiters pitching fake jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Spam Accounts** Many spam accounts attempt to lure candidates with the promise of an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Requests for Personal Information or Payment** These scammers often ask for personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> or request payment for fake job training or equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. People unfortunately fall for these traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers
These [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | predatory practices]] and scams contribute to a sense of frustration and can be particularly devastating for unemployed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The overwhelming number of applicants from all over the world, many of whom are not qualified or not based in the target country, buries recruiters with an avalanche of candidates, making it increasingly difficult for genuine professionals to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

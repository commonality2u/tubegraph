When approaching a job interview, one of the most common and challenging questions candidates face is about their salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Answering this question incorrectly can lead to rejection, as can refusing to answer at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Understanding the average salary range for a specific role is crucial for both the candidate and the employer, ensuring a fair offer and long-term satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Why Knowing the Average Salary Range is Important

For employers, asking about salary expectations is not a trick question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Recruiters want to determine if a candidate's expectations align with the company's [[understanding_company_salary_bands_and_market_compensation | salary band]] for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This ensures that if an offer is extended, the candidate will not only accept but also be excited about the compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. An employee who accepts a salary below their expectation is likely to be unsatisfied and seek other opportunities, leading to the position needing to be refilled quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

For candidates, having realistic [[impact_of_salary_expectations_on_job_offers | salary expectations]] based on market value is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. If your expectations are too high, you might be moved to the "no" pile unless you are a superstar candidate for whom the role might be "enriched" or elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Conversely, if your expectations are lower than the company's established salary band, you may receive an offer at the minimum of their range, which could result in a significant raise for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This often happens when candidates come from smaller or less reputable companies that don't pay market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Knowing the market value also helps you identify and avoid low-quality employers who might try to lowball an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## How to Determine the Average Salary for a Role

To effectively [[discussing_salary_expectations_in_interviews | discuss salary expectations]] in an interview, you need to know three key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:
1.  **Average Salary Range in the Open Market**: This requires investigative research. Begin with a Google search or visit sites like Glassdoor.com or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Look for similar job postings that have been recently advertised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. It's crucial to compare jobs in your local area, as salary ranges can differ significantly by region (e.g., Alabama vs. Bay Area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **Company's Expected Pay**: While you won't know the exact figure, your research into market value will give you a strong indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom Line Salary Expectation**: Understand the absolute minimum salary you would accept for the role, knowing when you would need to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This is for your internal knowledge and not necessarily to be shared with the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## [[Approaching the question of salary expectations in interviews | Approaching the Question of Salary Expectations]]

Once you have this information, you can approach the question in several ways:

*   **State Your Expectation Directly**: If you are confident in your [[understanding_market_value_for_job_roles | market value]] and believe your expectation aligns with the company's range, you can directly state your desired number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Ensure this number is reasonable and one you can live with throughout the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Frame Your Answer with Market Research**: If you suspect the company might offer a lower salary or your expectations are significantly higher, frame your answer by stating the market range you've researched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>: "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110 thousand. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> This puts the onus on the company to state if they are below market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Put the Question Back on the Recruiter**: If you're concerned about pricing yourself out of an opportunity or are willing to consider a lower salary, you can ask the recruiter for their typical range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>: "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

### Consequences of Refusing to Answer

Refusing to answer the question or giving a vague response will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Recruiters will not move you forward in the interview process without knowing if a deal can be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Furthermore, it may suggest you are hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Being ambiguous and hoping to negotiate later almost never works out well, as the hiring manager will likely be annoyed if they discover their offer is too low after spending time interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. If a recruiter becomes frustrated, it's best to simply provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

When interviewing for a new position, candidates are frequently asked about their [[the_importance_of_career_planning | career plans]], often phrased as "Where do you see yourself in five years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> While interviewers seek to understand a candidate's long-term commitment and potential for growth within the role, certain disclosures can negatively impact the outcome of an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## What Interviewers Look For <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>

Hiring teams want to know if a candidate has:
*   Commitment to the career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Long-term interest in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   The ability to grow and potentially be promoted within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Passion for the type of work they are interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Career Plan Revelations to Avoid

Certain statements about [[the_importance_of_career_planning | career plans]] can be perceived negatively by employers, potentially becoming a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Starting a Business or Switching Careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
Revealing a five-year plan that involves starting an unrelated business or making a complete career switch is generally not viewed positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This suggests a lack of passion for the specific job being interviewed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. While pursuing such goals is encouraged, candidates should carefully message these aspirations during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Limited Time in the Workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>
It is advisable not to disclose the number of years remaining in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This is particularly common among individuals in the last five to seven years of their working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For example, stating an intention to work only for another 10 years before retiring can be seen as a liability by a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

A hiring manager who envisions long-term growth for a role may form a bias against a candidate who plans to work for only three to five years, even if the average tenure of a worker is around three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This bias, though difficult to prove, can lead to a rejection letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

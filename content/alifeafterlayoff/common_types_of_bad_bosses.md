Understanding these types can help diagnose the workplace environment and decide whether to stay or seek change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Identifying Bad Boss Types

### The Narcissist Boss
This boss is easily identified by an inflated sense of self-worth and a larger-than-life ego, always seeking to be the center of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. While appearing charming to outsiders, their true nature emerges behind closed doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Very defensive of their position and accomplishments, even at the expense of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   May tear down subordinates to make themselves look better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   Unlikely to give praise as they want all attention on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

**Dealing with them:**
There's often little to do other than [[effects_of_narcissistic_bosses | cut bait and move on]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### The Aloof Boss
Generally likable, this boss often seems unaware of what's happening in their department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   [[characteristics_of_an_aloof_boss | Doesn't have a good grasp]] on the work being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   Not well-connected to projects or supporting teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   Not helpful in clearing roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   Requires repeated reminders for commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### The Workaholic Boss
This boss is extremely dedicated to their work, often the first to arrive and last to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Sends emails on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   Expects the same level of dedication from employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This is particularly prevalent with company owners who don't understand employees won't be as dedicated as them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

**Dealing with them:**
If this is not the desired work environment, it may be time to seek a different opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This relates to [[identifying_a_workaholic_boss | identifying a workaholic boss]].

### The Absent Boss
This boss is rarely seen and has unpredictable office hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Difficult to connect with when needed to clear roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   Often behind closed doors in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   Likely unaware of what subordinates are doing, leading to questionable performance feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

While it might seem like a relief not to be micromanaged, the inability to get help when needed makes this an undesirable, though not the worst, boss type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### The Angry Boss
Often known as the "hot head" of the organization, their outbursts are common and visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Can be heard screaming from their office, creating commotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   Flies off the handlebars at a moment's notice, making everyone walk on eggshells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   Lacks emotional intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   Screams, yells, and belittles coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

**Dealing with them:**
There's almost no upside to working for an angry boss. It's suggested to update one's resume and escape the [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This directly relates to [[dealing_with_a_terrible_boss | dealing with a terrible boss]].

### The Micromanager
This boss is constantly scrutinizing every detail of your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Breathing down your neck, too "in the weeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   Involved in almost every aspect of your job, watching every step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   Calls out mistakes in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   Perfectionists who nitpick everything and hold you to impossible standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

### The Unqualified Boss
Not necessarily a bad person, but often in a role due to being in the right place at the right time or being over-promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Lacks sufficient leadership experience to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   May see more senior team members as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   Uses subordinates' experience to make themselves look better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   May have insecurity, leading to overly harsh behavior to establish dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   At worst, they are unaware of their own lack of knowledge, leaving others to clean up their messes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
This creates a [[challenges_of_working_with_an_unqualified_boss | challenging situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### The Nepotism Boss
Often found in small to mid-sized companies, this boss has a direct relationship with the owner or CEO, usually a family member, former schoolmate, or friend who is placed in power without earning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Has a high sense of entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   Uses their position to gain dominance over the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   Often exhibits characteristics of other bad boss types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

This is generally a very difficult situation to be in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

### The Timid Boss
This boss is mousy, keeps to themselves, and is not a strong presence in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

**Characteristics:**
*   Often stuck in their role for a long time, hindering subordinates' upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   Pushed around by peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   Unlikely to defend or back up their team in business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   Will bow to peer pressure rather than confronting situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### The Friend Boss
This boss might be someone you knew outside of work or with whom you became friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. While it's generally pleasant to work for someone you like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, there are dangers.

**Characteristics:**
*   May have difficulty providing necessary developmental or performance feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   Lack of feedback can hold back career development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   Loyalty might cause employees to stay in a role too long, which can be detrimental to a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Encountering any of these bad boss types doesn't always mean immediately quitting, but it necessitates having a game plan for one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

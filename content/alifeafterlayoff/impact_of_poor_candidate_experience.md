Poor candidate experience, particularly through employment ghosting, is a significant issue in the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It is viewed as poor form and can have negative consequences for organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Defining Employment Ghosting

Employment ghosting is specifically defined as an employer or company representative reaching out to a candidate and moving them into a formalized interviewing process, then failing to follow up on the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It does not refer to instances where an applicant applies for a role and receives no response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Causes of Poor Candidate Experience

Several factors contribute to a poor candidate experience:

### Lazy Recruiting
This is the most common reason for ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Recruiters may be too busy or simply forget to close the loop with candidates, showing a lack of effort or care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Some recruiters are simply not very good at their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Bad Work Processes
Companies lacking strong internal controls or formalized talent acquisition departments often struggle with candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Without established [[best_practices_in_recruiting_and_candidate_followup | best practices in recruiting and candidate followup]], candidate experience suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Inadequate technology that cannot handle the volume of applicants can also lead to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
When recruiters manage more than 25 requisitions (a reasonable load being 15-25 depending on industry and role complexity), candidate experience inevitably suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Some organizations assign 40-50 requisitions to recruiters, double the manageable workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. With a requirement to submit multiple interviewable candidates per job, a recruiter can be dealing with over 200 candidates simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. In such scenarios, candidates can fall through the cracks, though this is not an excuse for poor experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Recruiter Oversight
In an overloaded environment, recruiters might simply forget to follow up with a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This oversight is not an excuse for poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness and Delays
Hiring managers can cause delays by taking too long to review candidates, or requesting additional candidates before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This can prolong the hiring process by weeks, making it appear to the candidate that they have been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Recruiters often push back on indecisive managers to disposition candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Jobs can be put on hold or re-scoped mid-process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Hiring managers may want to keep current candidates "lukewarm" while seeking different profiles, which can be frustrating for recruiters who must convey this ambiguous status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This often results in candidates being left without a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Other Candidate Hired (Lack of Closure)
A common reason for ghosting is when another candidate is hired, and the recruiter closes the requisition without following up with the remaining candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This is another symptom of poor work processes or bad recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Impact on Employment Brand and Bottom Line

Forward-thinking organizations prioritize candidate experience because they understand its impact on their employment brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Companies like Amazon implement strict metrics for recruiters to ensure timely feedback, like a "two and five promise" (two days for phone screens, five days for on-site loops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The rationale is that many job seekers are also customers of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. If a candidate is ghosted or treated poorly during an interview, they might choose not to do business with that company, which can significantly impact the company's bottom line if extrapolated across all interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Recruiters and CEOs are encouraged to treat candidates as they would customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## What to Do If You've Been Ghosted

Unfortunately, there is not much a candidate can do beyond sending a polite "nudge" to the recruiter after some time to inquire about the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This reminder might prompt the recruiter to provide an update or properly close out the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

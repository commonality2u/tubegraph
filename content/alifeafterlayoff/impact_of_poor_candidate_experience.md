Employment ghosting is a pervasive issue in the job market, characterized by an employer initiating a formal interview process with a candidate and then failing to provide updates on their application status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This differs from simply applying for a job and not hearing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Such practices are indicative of poor [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The speaker, a corporate recruiter, acknowledges having been a victim of ghosting himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Reasons for Poor Candidate Experience and Ghosting

Several factors contribute to employers failing to follow up with candidates:

### Lazy Recruiters
This is often cited as the most common reason for ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It stems from recruiters being too busy or unwilling to make the effort to close the loop on an interview process they initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Recruiters who are disorganized or lack a strong focus on [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] may simply neglect to provide updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This can be due to forgetfulness or indifference, both of which reflect poorly on the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In some cases, recruiters may simply not be effective at their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Bad Work Processes
Companies without robust internal controls and formalized talent acquisition departments often struggle with poor candidate communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. When recruiting functions are managed by general HR personnel instead of specialized talent acquisition professionals, best practices in recruiting may not be implemented, leading to a diminished [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Additionally, outdated or inadequate software that cannot manage high volumes of applicants can contribute to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
Recruiters typically manage 15 to 25 requisitions (job openings) at a time, depending on the industry and complexity of roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. When recruiters are assigned 40-50 or more requisitions—double a reasonable workload—[[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] inevitably suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. With a requirement to submit multiple interviewable candidates per job, a recruiter could be managing over 200 candidates simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. In such scenarios, even the most organized recruiters may inadvertently let candidates "fall through the cracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Recruiter Forgetfulness
While not an excuse for poor performance, a recruiter might simply forget to follow up with a candidate, especially when dealing with a heavy workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Lack of proper tools or processes to track candidates makes this more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness
Hiring managers often cause delays by taking extended periods to make decisions on candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. They might request to see additional candidates even after promising a quick turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This indecisiveness can significantly delay the hiring process, making it appear to early candidates that they have been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Recruiters often push back on hiring managers to make timely decisions to avoid this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Jobs can be placed on hold or re-scoped mid-process, leading to delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Hiring managers sometimes ask to "keep candidates lukewarm," meaning they want to retain interest without committing, while searching for a different caliber of candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This is difficult for recruiters to convey without suggesting a lack of strong interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. When a requisition is closed, recruiters may not always disposition all remaining candidates, leading to ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Another Candidate Hired
When a position is filled, the recruiter might close the requisition without following up with all other interviewed candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or ineffective recruiting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Consequences of Poor Candidate Experience

Poor [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]], especially ghosting, can have a significant negative [[issues_with_the_current_job_market_and_hiring_practices | impact]] on a company's employment brand and its business bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Damage to Employment Brand
Companies that prioritize [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] understand its importance to their overall employment brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Treating candidates poorly, such as through ghosting, can deter future talent and negatively impact how the company is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Impact on Customer Relations and Revenue
A prime example of prioritizing candidate experience is Amazon. They hold recruiters to strict metrics regarding [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] and have a "two and five promise": two days for follow-up after a hiring manager phone screen and five days after an on-site interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This policy forces hiring teams to be efficient and decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Amazon's philosophy is rooted in the understanding that many job seekers are also their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. If a candidate is ghosted or treated poorly, they may be disinclined to patronize Amazon's services or buy their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This negative sentiment, extrapolated across the vast number of interviews conducted, could significantly [[the_impact_of_unrealistic_expectations_on_job_seekers | impact]] the company's profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Recruiters and CEOs are encouraged to consider how they would treat a candidate if that person were also a current customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## What Job Seekers Can Do
Unfortunately, if you believe you've been ghosted, there isn't much you can do beyond sending a polite "nudge" to the recruiter after some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. A quick follow-up might prompt the recruiter to provide a status update or properly close out your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Asking questions demonstrates engagement and curiosity, and allows candidates to "screen" the company to ensure it's a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## The Importance of Asking Questions in Interviews

Hiring managers often dislike when candidates do not ask questions, as it suggests a lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. As a job seeker, it's crucial to ask questions not only to satisfy the interviewer's expectation of curiosity but also to proactively evaluate the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A single bad job can set back a career by years, making the interview a critical chance to assess potential roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Candidates should approach the interview with a mindset of interviewing the company as much as they are being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The best candidates often make it feel as if they are conducting the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While these suggestions are ideas, candidates should select questions most appropriate for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Questions can be asked at the end of the interview when prompted, or throughout the dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Key Questions to Ask

### 1. "Why is this position open?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
This question provides insight into the department's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   If the previous person was terminated, laid off, or quit, it suggests potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Candidates can further inquire about the reasons for their departure, such as dissatisfaction with work or performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   If it's an added headcount, it usually signifies departmental or company growth, which is a positive indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 2. "What is your vision for this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
Asking this early can provide an advantage, allowing candidates to tailor their answers throughout the interview to align with the hiring manager's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### 3. "What's one weakness that you currently have in your department?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
This question can also be flipped to ask about strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. It helps candidates understand where they might fit in and if their skills align with departmental needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### 4. "How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
This question helps determine if the candidate aligns with the interviewer's expectations for the role's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### 5. "How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
This ensures that expectations are reasonable and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Unreasonable expectations can lead to failure and quick turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This question helps determine if it's a good cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### 6. "What is it about that person that made them so successful in this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
If someone was previously in the role and promoted, understanding their success factors provides a roadmap for the new hire to duplicate those actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### 7. "Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
While candidates shouldn't appear anxious to leave the role immediately, it's reasonable to inquire about a long-term career path to ensure the position isn't a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. However, it's important to show plenty of interest in the role being interviewed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### 8. "What would you describe your leadership style as?" or "If I was to go out into your department and ask some of your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
These questions help candidates vet their potential boss and understand if their leadership style aligns with what they seek in a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. It provides insight into the manager's self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### 9. "Now I noticed that one of your competitors came out with a really intriguing new product, process, or idea. How is this company planning to address that and stay in front of the market?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
This question assesses the organization's strategic direction and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. A reputable company will be aware of competitors and have a strategic response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A lack of awareness can be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This requires prior research on the company and its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### 10. "If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
This "fun" question encourages strategic thinking and provides deep insight into true concerns within the department or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The "Great Resignation" is a phenomenon where people are voluntarily leaving their jobs en masse, largely influenced by changes over the past 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This trend is a legitimate phenomenon, with research by Microsoft indicating that up to 41% of currently working individuals plan to leave their jobs within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>. The U.S. Labor Department reported a record four million people quit their jobs voluntarily in April 2021, marking the beginning of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>.

## Reasons for Increased Employee Dissatisfaction

The shift in workplace dynamics and personal priorities has significantly impacted employee satisfaction, leading to a wave of resignations.

### Re-evaluation of Commuting and Office Life
The pandemic forced many to work remotely, leading people to re-evaluate their lives and the time spent commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:36">[02:36:36]</a>. Many realized that much of their work did not necessitate an office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:45">[02:45:45]</a>. Previously, [[remote_work_vs_office_work | remote work]] often carried a stigma, with assumptions of less dedication or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>. However, some individuals actually found themselves working more hours in a remote role compared to an office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:24">[03:24:24]</a>, due to the elimination of long commutes, which could take up to four and a half to five hours daily for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:58">[03:58:58]</a>. Despite the value in face-to-face interaction and building relationships, many felt required to be in the office for "face time" even when work could easily be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>.

### Forced Adaptation and Realizations
In 2020, companies with traditional work models were compelled to transition to remote work arrangements, revealing that many positions, particularly in white-collar professional roles, could be performed effectively from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:11">[05:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:50">[05:50:50]</a>. The unexpected closure of schools and the need for homeschooling further highlighted the need for flexible work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:02">[06:02:02]</a>. After 18 months of remote work, many employees began to question the necessity of returning to traditional office settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:46">[06:46:46]</a>. Some leaders, including those in financial services like JP Morgan, began requiring a return to the office without clear business justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:58">[06:58:58]</a>.

### Compensation Discrepancies and Employee Overload
Another point of contention has been the concept of reducing an employee's salary if they relocate from a high-cost-of-living area (e.g., New York City) to a lower-cost area while performing the same remote job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>. This is perceived as punitive, especially when companies can save on office space and associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:40">[07:40:40]</a>.

Furthermore, companies often overcorrected with layoffs during the pandemic's onset, cutting deeper than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:36">[10:36:36]</a>. When the market rebounded faster than anticipated, the remaining employees were burdened with increased workloads, leading to exhaustion and "digital burnout" from constant virtual meetings and calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:18">[11:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:51">[11:51:51]</a>. Many employees have become "fed up" with these conditions, contributing to the voluntary resignations during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:28">[12:28:28]</a>, indicating a shift in [[changes_in_workplace_loyalty | workplace loyalty]].

## The Shifting Landscape for Employers

The current job market, particularly at the hourly and professional levels, is seen as a "buyer's market" for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:34">[08:34:34]</a>. Companies that maintain rigid philosophies regarding [[remote_work_vs_office_work | return to office]] policies and lack flexibility are likely to struggle in recruiting and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:51">[08:51:51]</a>.

### Remote Work and Flexibility as New Standards
Remote work and flexibility, along with a focus on [[work-life balance]], are no longer competitive advantages but rather standard expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:27">[09:27:27]</a>. Companies failing to offer these will face a competitive disadvantage in the recruitment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:19">[10:19:19]</a>. Recruiters are increasingly encountering questions about blended or [[shift_from_remote_work_to_hybrid_models | hybrid opportunities]] from candidates, highlighting the growing importance of these factors for employee satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:47">[09:47:47]</a>. This competitive pressure indicates a growing [[job_market_competition_for_remote_positions | job market competition for remote positions]].

### The Concept of "Employment Experience"
Companies must adapt to this new environment by focusing on the "employment experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes the way people work and live, from productivity and flexibility to well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:43">[14:43:43]</a>. To remain competitive, companies need to offer:
*   Competitive salary, compensation, and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:56">[13:56:56]</a>
*   Clear career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:16">[14:16:16]</a>
*   Support for [[work-life balance]], avoiding excessive working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:19">[14:19:19]</a>
*   Full-time employment options over contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:25">[14:25:25]</a>
*   Flexible work arrangements, including [[remote_work_vs_office_work | remote work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:32">[14:32:32]</a>

People are increasingly seeking roles that provide true value to their work lives and are unwilling to remain in low-level, menial jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:04">[14:04:04]</a>. Many are making complete career changes, driven by a desire for satisfaction and a rejection of antiquated business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:27">[15:27:27]</a>. This collective redefinition of priorities among the workforce is forcing companies to adapt, which is viewed as a positive development for the future of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:54">[15:54:54]</a>.

When [[evaluating_the_company_and_role_as_a_candidate | evaluating a company and role]], job candidates should actively ask questions to understand the organization's vision, strategic direction, and opportunities for growth. This ensures the role aligns with their career aspirations and the company offers stability and a clear future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding the Role's Purpose and Future

In an interview, asking "Why is this position open?" provides insight into the department's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. If the position is an added headcount, it generally indicates departmental or company growth, which is often a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

It is also beneficial to ask the hiring manager, "What is your vision for this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Understanding the long-term purpose behind the position's creation can help a candidate align their interview answers with the company's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

For individuals seeking [[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | career advancement]], it is important to inquire about "potential growth opportunities in the long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While not appearing anxious to leave the current job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, candidates have a reasonable right to understand their potential long-term career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> and ensure the role is not a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. It is important to demonstrate enthusiasm for the role being interviewed for, even while inquiring about future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Evaluating Company Stability and Strategic Direction

Understanding the organization's strategy is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Candidates should avoid joining a company lacking strategic direction or one whose direction they do not believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. It's crucial to assess the longevity and stability of the position, ensuring a move from a solid situation does not lead to an unstable new opportunity and potential layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

Before the interview, candidates should research the company's major competitors and any industry-shaking new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. They can then ask, "I noticed that one of your competitors came out with a really intriguing new product, process, or idea. How is this company planning to address that and stay in front of the market?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. A reputable company should be aware of competitors and have a strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A lack of such awareness is a significant [[company_reputation_assessment | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Uncovering Underlying Concerns

To gain deeper insight into a company's strategic thinking, a candidate can ask, "If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The answer can reveal significant behind-the-scenes dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Landing a job interview is a significant achievement, and the goal is to make the most of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To maximize your chances, it's crucial to avoid certain [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | common interview mistakes]] that can hinder your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Interviewing can feel like navigating a minefield, where one misstep can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The following list, compiled from years of experience as a corporate recruiter, highlights what you should avoid revealing to a recruiter or hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Over-sharing Personal Facts

Revealing too much personal information is a [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | common interview mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This often indicates nervousness or being long-winded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

*   **Impact on Employer Perception**: Employers may link your ability to articulate yourself in an interview to how you would perform in a business setting or meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Being long-winded can imply a lack of emotional intelligence or the inability to convey thoughts clearly and concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Conciseness**: Aim for interview answers that are two to three minutes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. If you overshare due to nervousness, practice more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Potential Bias**: Over-sharing personal details, like hobbies, can create an unconscious bias, either for or against you, depending on the interviewer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It's best to avoid sharing anything particularly personal and keep discussions strictly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Revealing the "Real" Reason for Leaving Your Current Employer

While honesty is valued, you don't need to disclose the entire truth about why you're leaving, especially if it involves negative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   **Negative Perceptions**:
    *   If you say you disliked your boss or were treated poorly, an employer might perceive you as difficult to work with or a potential problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This can be a significant [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Stating that your previous job didn't challenge you enough might lead the employer to believe you don't take initiative to find more engaging work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Strategic Messaging**: Figure out the true reason for your departure and articulate it in a way that doesn't sound threatening or negative to a potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Over-sharing Career Plans

When asked about your career plans, such as "where do you see yourself in five years?", employers are looking for commitment to the career path and potential for growth within their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **Risk of Deal-Breaker**: Disclosing plans to start an unrelated business or switch careers within a few years is generally viewed negatively and can be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This indicates a lack of passion for the role you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Convey Passion**: It's essential to convey a level of passion for the work you're seeking to make a hiring manager feel good about your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Revealing Desperation for a Job

Even if you're in an urgent situation, such as being laid off or fired, expressing desperation for a job can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

*   **Negative Perception**: Employers will perceive desperation, which, similar to the dating world, can push the desired outcome further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Composure**: Despite urgency, you must convey that you are calm, collected, and a "cool customer" to avoid being categorized as overly eager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Inadvertently Revealing Your Age or Remaining Years in the Workforce

Age can be a factor in discrimination, affecting both younger and older candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

*   **Resume and Technology**: Be cautious of details on your resume, like outdated contact methods (e.g., fax numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, or even your email address, which might indicate your age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Ensure dates on your resume are carefully managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Long-term Plans**: Avoid indicating how many years you have left in the workforce, especially if you're nearing the end of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Stating you only plan to work for a few more years can create a bias against you, particularly if the hiring manager expects someone with 10+ years of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Disclosing Major Medical Issues or Disabilities

While employers have a right to know if you can meet the basic requirements of a position, they should ask about this during the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Disclosure Timing**:
    *   If you have a disability that does not interfere with your ability to perform the job, it's generally not recommended to bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   If a reasonable accommodation is required, this should be indicated in the application or when asked by the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   For conditions like high-functioning autism where you might want the employer to be aware for accommodations, the time of job offer is more appropriate for discussion, not during the interview itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Focus on Job Performance**: You are hired for your ability to perform the job based on the requirements in the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Revealing such information prematurely can inadvertently create bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Revealing Your Political Belief System

It's tempting to share political views, especially if you feel aligned with a company's mission or a hiring manager's potential viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

*   **Avoid Discussion**: The political spectrum is wide and often heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. It's best to stay completely out of political discussions, as you never know the interviewer's beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Disclosing Your Previous Salary

This is a very common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. When the salary question arises, typically during the recruiter phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

*   **Locking Yourself In**: Disclosing your previous salary can lock you into a lower salary range, especially if you were underpaid compared to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Determine Your Own Worth**: You, the employee, should determine your worth based on your skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities, considering the open market value, rather than letting an employer dictate your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. For guidance on how to answer the salary question, refer to resources on salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

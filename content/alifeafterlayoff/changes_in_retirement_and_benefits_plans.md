The concept of a "traditional career," which once included the expectation of a pension upon [[historical_perspective_on_job_security_and_benefits | retirement]], is now considered largely obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This traditional model involved selecting a career at age 18, dedicating 40 years to an employer, collecting a pension, and then retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, for most individuals in the modern workplace, this traditional arrangement no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Benefits

In past generations, like those of grandparents or parents, careers often involved long-term employment with significant employer loyalty and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
A key aspect of this traditional employment model was the "defined benefits plan," where employers commonly paid for the entirety of an employee's [[retirement_planning_and_financial_instability_for_baby_boomers | retirement plan]] through pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Employees in these historical periods would often work for 45 years and receive a great pension plan upon their departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## The Shift to Defined Contribution Plans

A significant change in the employment arrangement occurred from the 1970s to the 1990s, when there was a shift from defined benefits to "defined contribution plans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This transition moved the entire burden of funding [[retirement_planning_and_financial_instability_for_baby_boomers | retirement]] onto the employee, with employers typically only offering a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Vesting Periods

To further complicate matters for employees, companies implemented long vesting periods, often four or more years, before employees could claim the employer's matched contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If an employer matched a portion of income (e.g., 3-4%), an employee typically had to work a certain number of years, usually at least four, to make a claim to that money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Consequently, if an employee was [[being_laid_off_benefits_and_drawbacks | laid off]] after two years, the employer was not obligated to pay for the last two years of vesting, and the employee would lose that matched money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This system means employers are less committed to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Consequences for Employees

This [[changes_in_corporate_loyalty_and_employment_practices | decoupling of loyalty]] has led to a situation where employers are no longer paying for [[retirement_planning_and_financial_instability_for_baby_boomers | retirement programs]] as they once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Employees can no longer rely on employers to fund even a 401k plan, especially with the increased frequency of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This trend is particularly disruptive for those later in their careers who are approaching [[retirement_planning_and_financial_instability_for_baby_boomers | retirement]] and may realize they are not financially prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Shifting Retirement Age

There are even discussions from think tanks suggesting that the [[retirement_planning_and_financial_instability_for_baby_boomers | retirement age]] should be moved back to 70 or even beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Reality

Given these [[changes_in_corporate_loyalty_and_employment_practices | fundamental shifts]], employees must now approach their careers much more strategically, acting as "free agents" and "CEOs of their careers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The expectation that an employer will look out for an employee's best interest, as was common in past generations, no longer holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Employees are increasingly responsible for funding their own [[retirement_planning_and_financial_instability_for_baby_boomers | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

The current job market is proving to be one of the most challenging experienced, making it significantly harder to find a job compared to a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Many job seekers are applying to hundreds of jobs without success, reflecting a significant shift in the job market over the past 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Current State of the Labor Market

The current period is described as a challenging time to be a job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This contrasts sharply with 18 months ago, during the "great resignation," when employers were readily offering high salaries to attract talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Those who experienced the "gravy train" of readily available, high-paying jobs are now facing a very different reality, with many having been laid off due to their high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### The Shifting Employment Pendulum

The power dynamic in the labor market has shifted. Last year, power resided with the employee, allowing them to dictate terms and reclaim some balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, the pendulum is now swinging back, favoring employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This is evident in:
*   **Slowing Hiring** Employers are slowing down their hiring processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Continued Layoffs** [[impact_of_layoffs_and_market_fluctuation_on_job_availability | Layoffs]] have been widespread, particularly in the tech space, and are expected to continue into the second half of 2023 and potentially expand beyond tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Increased Competition** As a direct result of layoffs, there is significantly [[impact_of_economic_downturns_on_job_availability | increased competition]] in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Industries and Roles Most Affected

Certain job sectors have been disproportionately impacted by the economic cooldown:
*   **Tech Sector** Roles such as product managers, software developers, and other technology-related positions have seen many layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Many who received large pay raises in the past 18 months found their new positions to be very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Recruiting/Human Resources** Recruiters experienced a brief "heydays" where they could easily find multiple job offers with substantial pay increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. However, they were often the "last one's hired, the first one's fired," leading to a significant surplus of recruiters in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Now, hundreds, if not thousands, of applicants are competing for roles that previously struggled to find enough candidates, making it a frustrating time for job seekers in these verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Changes in the Hiring Process

[[impact_of_the_hiring_process_on_job_seekers | The hiring process]] has undergone significant changes that negatively impact job seekers:
*   **Reduced Recruiters** With fewer recruiters, the hiring burden has shifted to hiring managers, who are already overloaded with work due to smaller teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Many hiring managers are not trained in recruiting and often don't want to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Slower and Poorer Processes** This shift results in slower hiring processes, difficulty with interview scheduling, and delayed feedback, making it much more challenging for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Recruiters, despite their flaws, serve as advocates managing candidates through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Hiring Freezes and Rescinded Offers** Companies are implementing hiring freezes and pausing job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Offers are being rescinded frequently, sometimes just a day or two before the start date, leading to significant distress for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Economic Caution** Employers are making slower, more careful hiring decisions, watching for [[signs_of_economic_cooldown_affecting_job_opportunities | signs of economic downturns]] and potential recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. They are reluctant to add expensive costs like large salaries or launch new products during uncertain times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Hiring

The rapid emergence of AI is a significant factor in the changing hiring landscape:
*   **Workforce Replacement** Companies are actively exploring how AI will affect their workforce, with some looking to replace human workers with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This leads to companies putting the brakes on open job requisitions to re-evaluate how work can be distributed and reshaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. AI is seen as a cheaper alternative that can output more work than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Automation of Recruiting** Companies are also automating more of their recruiting processes, partly out of necessity after laying off recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Job seekers are increasingly interacting with AI during the application process, which makes it more impersonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Impersonal Screening and Interviews** AI-driven processes often result in more rejections because they operate on a "black and white", binary system, filtering candidates without human interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This is particularly disadvantageous for those looking to change careers or industries, as it removes the opportunity for a human to give a chance based on non-obvious skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The [[the_impact_of_remote_work_and_modern_hiring_platforms | candidate experience]] has worsened, with AI handling much of the screening and even appearing in first-round interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. One-way video interviews are also increasingly common, where candidates speak to a camera with no direct human interaction, and their responses may be analyzed by AI for keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Shift Away from Remote Work

Companies are increasingly forcing a return to the office, signaling a "war on the remote worker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. While outright elimination of remote work is unlikely, a hybrid model is becoming the most probable outcome for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

This shift creates significant disadvantages for job seekers who rely on remote opportunities:
*   **Geographic Limitations** Those who moved to areas with fewer job opportunities, relying on remote work, may now face difficult decisions about changing their lifestyle, schedule, or even relocating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Reduced Opportunities** The number of available job opportunities for remote workers is drastically reduced compared to two years ago, when almost every job was remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Job seekers may need to be located where the work is, even if it's on a hybrid basis, to secure employment quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## [[impact_on_job_seekers | Impact on Job Seekers]]

Overall, there are fewer quality jobs available, and more people are looking for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. It is taking longer on average for individuals to find employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. A LinkedIn study found that the average job seeker is applying to 40% more jobs today than a year ago, with fewer opportunities and more rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This difficult labor market can be very frustrating and disheartening, especially for those recently impacted by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Strategies for Job Seekers

Given the challenging environment, job seekers need a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Key strategies include:
*   **Authoritative Job Search** Approaching the job search in a more authoritative manner is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Effective Resume Writing** Learning to write a solid, customized resume is vital to stand out from the crowd and cut through the thousands of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Many applicants do not customize their submissions, making a tailored resume highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Strong Interviewing Skills** If an interview is secured, having a firm strategy for each round is essential to stand out among the increased volume of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Optimizing LinkedIn** A highly preferable method is to have recruiters find the job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Developing an optimized LinkedIn profile can attract recruiters and even allow job seekers to bypass them to directly engage with hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

The question "what are your salary expectations?" is almost guaranteed to be asked in an interview, often in the preliminary interview with a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This question is critical because the number you provide at this stage will typically follow you throughout the entire interviewing process, making it difficult to deviate from later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Therefore, having a solid strategy is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Why Strategy is Key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>

Even with current trends towards [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | salary transparency]], published ranges can be abnormally wide and unhelpful for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. It is important to control the compensation discussion carefully, as if you are the CEO of your own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Preparation Before the Interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>

Before stepping into an interview, conduct thorough [[preparing_for_salary_expectation_questions | salary research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. You need to know the minimum acceptable salary you would need to feel comfortable and satisfied in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Responding to the Question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>

When an interviewer asks about your salary requirements, try to put the question back on them first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>:

> "Are you willing to share?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>

If they provide a range that aligns with your expectations, that's a positive start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

If they push back and insist you provide a number first, be strategic with your response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:

> "Other opportunities that I'm considering are paying between [your minimum acceptable salary] and [your minimum acceptable salary + 20%]. Does that seem to make sense with you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

This approach avoids giving a single fixed number, providing [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_recruiters | wiggle room]] for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

#### What to Avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

Avoid stating your previous salary or simply what you *would like* to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Focus on a range to ensure flexibility.

### Re-addressing Salary Expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>

If the recruiter commits to moving you to the next round of interviews but hasn't yet covered salary expectations, it's an appropriate time to bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>:

> "I'm really interested in this opportunity, but in order for me to commit to the next round, I just want to make sure that we're on the same page. Can we talk compensation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

You can then refer back to the strategic approach of providing a range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

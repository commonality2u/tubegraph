A video by YouTube channel "Logical Finance" conducted an experiment where an individual applied for 1,000 jobs to investigate if a labor market shortage truly exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article reacts to the video from a corporate recruiter's perspective, offering insights and advice for job seekers based on the experiment's findings and the recruiter's professional experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Experiment: Applying to 1,000 Jobs

The experiment involved applying to 1,000 jobs, a highly dedicated effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The creator used fictional names and multiple resume versions (college vs. high school, different work experiences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. They tracked all responses using new email addresses and phone numbers for each candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

The application methods included:
*   Visiting career sites of S&P 500 companies and searching for entry-level jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Going directly to an employer's website often provides the most accurate and up-to-date job listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   Searching career websites like Indeed and CareerBuilder for entry-level positions, then going directly to the company websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Recruiter's View on [[Current job market challenges | The Current Job Market]]

The current labor market is [[Challenges faced by recruiters in a tight labor market | very difficult from a recruiting perspective]] for many positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Industries like retail, heavy industry, and trucking are [[Challenges in the current job market | struggling to find people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Specifically, skilled labor and professional roles, especially in software and highly technical jobs, are very competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

However, positions in sales or business development are not as difficult to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Finance is also anecdotally robust, with candidates relatively easy to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Resume Critiques and Best Practices

The recruiter expressed skepticism about the experiment's results due to several resume practices:

### Avoiding Graphic Designer Templates
Resume templates purchased from sites like Etsy or found on Canva are often designed by graphic designers with the goal of looking pretty, rather than being functional for discoverability by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These templates can make a job seeker essentially invisible to recruiters using boolean search on ATS systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> A simple, clean resume without excessive graphics or columns allows for maximum discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. A key indicator of an ATS-compliant resume is if you don't have to manually re-enter much information after uploading it to an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Customization is Key
The experiment's lack of resume customization is a major drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Customizing a resume for each job application is the single most impactful action a job seeker can take to increase callback chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Having multiple versions of a resume is recommended, especially if you have experience in different career verticals. Each version should be customized and niche-specific, rather than being a "jack of all trades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Objective Statements vs. Career Summaries
While objective statements are generally pointless, a career summary can be beneficial. It helps recruiters quickly brand or profile a candidate, as not all resumes are easily scannable for this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Application Process Pain Points

The experiment highlighted several frustrating aspects of online job applications:

*   **Re-entering Information:** Having to manually refill or correct information after uploading a resume due to non-ATS compliant templates is a significant time sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Assessment Tests:** Assessment tests (personality profiles, Wonderlic tests) at the application level are viewed as "un-candidate friendly" and a poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The recruiter suggests that companies requiring these tests at the initial application stage may not be valuing the candidate's time, and personally, he would abandon such applications unless "absolutely smitten" with the company or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **"Entry-Level with Experience" Meme:** The common meme of entry-level jobs requiring several years of experience is often an exaggeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. In a sample of 50 entry-level jobs, only two specifically *required* experience, and six preferred it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This discrepancy is often due to automated ATS systems categorizing jobs incorrectly, rather than human error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. It's better to search by job title than by experience level when applying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

## Experiment Results and the Job Market
Out of 1,003 applications, the experiment received 259 interview requests and 47 rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This represents a 27-28% response rate, which the recruiter found surprisingly good, especially for entry-level, relatively low-paying positions and given the use of a non-customized template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This high response rate suggests that companies are "desperate for labor right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

About 650 applications received no response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Reasons for this include jobs already being filled, candidates not being a good fit, or recruiters being overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Recruiters are often handling a high volume of requisitions (30-50 each), leading to delays in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

Resume B, which performed better, received a 30% response rate compared to Resume A's 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Job Seeker's Market

The results confirm that the entry-level job market is currently strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. There is indeed a job seeker's "buying market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is considered the best time in the recruiter's lifetime for job seekers to find new employment, especially if dissatisfied with their current situation (underpaid, overworked, burned out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Job seekers should consider exploring new opportunities before the [[Market instability and employment trends | market pendulum swings back]] due to potential economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

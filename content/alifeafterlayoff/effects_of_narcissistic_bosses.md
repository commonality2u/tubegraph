A narcissistic boss is one of the [[common_types_of_bad_bosses | common types of bad bosses]] you might encounter in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Identifying this type of boss is relatively easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> due to several distinct characteristics and the noticeable impact they have on their direct reports.

## Characteristics of a Narcissistic Boss

Narcissistic bosses typically exhibit:
*   **Inflated Self-Worth and Ego** They possess a very inflated sense of self-worth, a larger-than-life ego, and often act as if they own the workplace, even if they don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. They constantly seek to be the center of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Charming Public Persona** To the outside world, such as other departments, they can appear very charming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. However, their true nature becomes apparent behind closed doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Defensiveness** They are highly defensive of their position and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Impact on Employees

Working for a narcissistic boss can have several negative effects on employees:
*   **Taking Credit for Others' Work** They may claim your accomplishments as their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. If another department recognizes your achievement, a narcissistic boss may view it as a personal attack on their own accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Belittling Behavior** They might tear you down in front of others to elevate their own image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Praise** Employees are unlikely to receive much praise from a narcissistic boss, as these bosses desire all the attention for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Recommendation

Unfortunately, if you are working for a narcissistic boss, there is little you can do other than leaving the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This often means you need to "cut bait and move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

The process of checking references can vary significantly between smaller companies and larger corporations, primarily due to differing policies and concerns, especially regarding [[liability_concerns_associated_with_giving_references | liability]]. As a job seeker, understanding these differences is crucial for providing effective references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Reference Checks in Smaller Companies and Agencies

Smaller companies or agencies are more likely to conduct thorough reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This is also common when agencies submit candidates to larger corporations, with the agency often handling the reference check on behalf of the larger company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. When these entities ask for references, they generally follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

During these checks, they typically call the provided references and ask a series of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These questions usually relate to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   The job itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   The candidate's work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   Attendance (especially for hourly positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Any concerns the reference might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   The candidate's strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Whether the candidate is eligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

These conversations usually involve about three to five questions on a standard form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A common challenge for recruiters is tracking down references and getting them to return calls, which can delay the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Reference Checks in Larger Corporations

Larger corporations often have policies that make them reluctant to provide detailed references, primarily due to [[liability_concerns_associated_with_giving_references | liability concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If a previous employer gives negative feedback that prevents a candidate from getting a position, they could face legal action for slander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Human Resources professionals in these companies prioritize limiting liability and exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This caution extends even to interview feedback, which is often kept generic to avoid potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Because of these policies, larger companies generally:
*   Do not give out references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   Instruct their employees, especially those with direct reports, not to give references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Any requests are filtered back to the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   When HR does respond, they typically provide only "name, rank, and serial number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This includes the candidate's name, dates of employment (start and end), and job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   They will not disclose compensation, rehire eligibility, or the reason for termination, as this information could be used against the company in an adverse hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Therefore, candidates applying to larger corporations can often rest assured that their past employers will not provide detailed or negative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Best Practices for Candidates Providing References

Regardless of company size, job seekers should approach providing references strategically:

*   **Choose Legitimate and Strong References**:
    *   Prioritize professional references who were direct managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   If a manager isn't available for all references, consider customers (internal or external) you directly supported, or someone at least one or two levels above you who can speak to your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Avoid using peers or "buddies" in the same role, as their feedback is less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Ensure a Positive Reference**:
    *   Only include individuals who you are confident will provide a good recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Recruiters have encountered situations where a provided reference gave negative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   If you're unsure if someone will give you a good reference, do not include them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Notify Your References**:
    *   Always get permission from someone before listing them as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
    *   Inform them that you are interviewing and that they might receive a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This prevents them from mistaking the call for spam and ensures a quicker response, which can speed up your hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

While many major employers may not heavily weight or even conduct detailed reference checks, it's still an important final step in the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Typically, if you've reached the reference check stage, you are likely close to receiving a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

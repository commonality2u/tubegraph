To advance in one's career, it may be beneficial to adopt a more self-serving approach, prioritizing one's own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective is particularly relevant in the modern job market, where traditional corporate loyalty has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## The Free Agent Mindset

Acting as a "free agent" or the "CEO of your career" means consistently looking out for your own best interests first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. There is "absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish in your career" because no one else will prioritize your well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Companies often view employees as "human resources" or "a number on a spreadsheet," maintaining employment only as long as the individual is useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

The concept of a "lifer" at one company, collecting a pension and working for decades, is largely a relic of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. The current workforce operates on a "what have you done for me lately" basis, with quick layoffs during difficult times followed by rushes to rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Maximizing Earnings

Choosing a job that offers the highest possible compensation is a logical step when acting as a free agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. If an individual has the opportunity to earn more in their profession, such as at a top-tier company like Google or Amazon, they should pursue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This approach can help build a larger "nest egg" for future financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

## Current Labor Market Conditions

The labor market has experienced a "definitive softening" in recent months, marked by widespread layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, which are now extending into other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Companies have been criticized for handling layoffs unprofessionally, sometimes without dignity or respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

Examples of unprofessional layoff conduct include:
*   An employee at Google being denied entry to the office after a mandatory return-to-office policy, realizing their badge no longer worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   Individuals being notified of layoffs while on business trips, away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   A person being laid off while in labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   Someone being laid off by Google after only 13 weeks of employment, having been recruited away from a potentially stable previous job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

There is a perceived lack of accountability from companies for how these actions disrupt people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Some companies, like Zillow, have laid off staff only to repost the same positions shortly after, raising questions about forecasting and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## [[Strategies for job seekers to navigate the job market | Employment Strategies]]

Given the competitive market and lack of corporate loyalty, individuals should prioritize their own career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

### Choosing Employers Wisely

A key strategy is to hold companies accountable by choosing which offers to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. If a company has a history of poor behavior, particularly in how it handles employees and layoffs, it should be a factor in your decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. When interviewing, it is important to assess how companies behaved during the 2020 economic boom and the current downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. This ensures alignment with organizations that possess the right core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

### Navigating Multiple Job Offers

Even after accepting a job offer and having a confirmed start date, it is advisable to continue with other interview processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. For example, one individual who was laid off received multiple offers, including a significant raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. After starting a new job, they received an even stronger offer (nearly $100,000 more than their original salary) and were advised to consider taking the better opportunity, acting as a free agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of always thinking for oneself and not owing an employer anything beyond an honest day's work for an honest day's pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

When considering a counter-offer from your current employer, it's essential to recognize the underlying reasons why such an offer is made. Often, it signals that your employer has been undervaluing your contributions.

## Initial Underpayment
A significant sign of being undervalued is when an external job offer presents a substantial pay increase, such as a 30% bump, for similar work with expanded responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This often indicates that the employee was likely underpaid to begin with or had remained in their role for too long without appropriate compensation adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Regularly checking the open market and taking interviews can help keep employers "honest" about market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Sudden "Big Plans" After Resignation
A common indicator of being undervalued is when, upon tendering your resignation, your current company suddenly reveals "big plans" for your future that were never discussed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. These plans often involve significant promotions, new teams under your leadership, or increased responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This is described as the "proverbial carrot" dangled in front of employees, a common trap that keeps people in jobs too long based on unfulfilled promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Talk is cheap, and plans, especially with some companies, "come to fruition slowly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, so it's wise to demand any counter-offer details, including new job titles and pay, be in writing and documented by Human Resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

## Lack of Proactive Recognition and Development
An employer that truly values you would proactively identify your potential and include you in career development and succession planning programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
Signs they haven't been doing this include:
*   **Being caught off guard by your departure:** They likely thought you were a "steady Eddie" who would never disrupt the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Only recognizing your value when you're leaving:** The question "Why wasn't I recognized before? It only took me tendering my resignation to head out the door?" is a valid one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This is akin to the sentiment that "sometimes people don't [know] what they have until it's gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
*   **Absence from succession planning:** If a company genuinely sees you for senior-level roles (VP, C-Suite), you should already be on their succession planning program, receiving development, mentoring, and invitations to specific meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. Respectable companies invest in this, even sending employees back to school for certain skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Slow career advancement:** If career advancement typically requires someone to die or retire, especially in smaller companies, it's a sign of stagnation rather than proactive growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.

## Employer's Self-Centered Perspective
An employer that undervalues you will frame counter-offers and discussions from a "we can use you" perspective, rather than a "we would like to help you grow your career" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. This indicates that the company is looking at the situation from their perspective only, not considering your career aspirations or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>.

## Trust Your Gut and Past Performance
Your past experience with your employer is the best indicator of their future behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. If they have previously taken you for granted or not recognized your worth, it's likely they will continue to do so, even with a counter-offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Trust your gut feeling, as it "is almost always going to lead you in the right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Accepting a counter-offer can make you a "flight risk" in the eyes of your employer, and you may become the "most expensive person in the department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This puts a target on your back for any future layoffs or performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

In summary, while there might be rare exceptions, generally, if a company only recognizes your value and potential when you have one foot out the door, it's a strong [[signs_of_low_quality_employers|sign of being undervalued]] and often not in your best long-term career interest to accept their counter-offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.

When navigating a job search, particularly in an uncertain market, individuals may consider whether to pursue contract positions or continue seeking full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there can be a stigma associated with contract work, viewing it as lower quality or merely temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, it's important to understand how recruiters and career coaches view these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[pros_of_contract_work | Pros of Contract Work]]

*   **Higher Availability**
    Contract positions are often more readily available, especially in uncertain economic climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Companies may be apprehensive about adding permanent headcount but still require work to be done, leading them to prefer contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This means a higher likelihood of being considered for a contract role due to their prevalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Opportunity to Demonstrate Skills**
    Contract roles offer a chance for individuals to prove their capabilities to an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. From an employer's perspective, contracting reduces risk, especially if a candidate is considered a "stretch" or if the role requires a niche skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Hiring managers, who tend to be risk-averse, might use contract roles as a strategy to assess a candidate's fit before converting them to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Not all contract positions lead to conversion, as some are for temporary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, but many are designed for candidates to demonstrate their aptitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. It's a good question to ask during an interview if a contract has the likelihood of conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

*   **[[using_contract_work_for_career_transitions | Career Pivoting and Skill Development]]**
    Contracting can facilitate a pivot into a new industry, job type, or allow individuals to gain new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For example, if seeking to enter a new industry (like healthcare in Nashville) where prior experience is lacking, a contract position can provide the necessary experience to update a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It's a strategic way to fill skill gaps on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Income Continuation**
    Contract positions allow individuals to maintain an income stream while continuing their search for a full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This is particularly valuable given that a typical job search can take six to nine months, or even up to a year in some markets, and unemployment benefits may run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. A contract role can bridge this financial gap, buying more time to find the ideal full-time job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **"Test Drive" the Company**
    Just as a company can evaluate a contractor, a contractor can "test drive" the company, work environment, and team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If the work environment, tasks, or co-workers are not a good fit, it's easier to leave a contract position than a full-time one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Confidence Boost and Routine**
    For those who have experienced a layoff, a contract position can help boost confidence, re-enter the workforce, and re-establish a routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It's generally easier to look for a job when already employed and receiving a steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

*   **Potentially Higher Hourly Pay**
    In many cases, contract positions can offer a higher hourly rate compared to the equivalent full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Some individuals make enough in contract roles to take extended breaks each year and still be financially stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This [[financial_considerations_in_contract_vs_fulltime_work | financial advantage]] typically comes without benefits and the security of a full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## [[cons_of_contract_work | Cons of Contract Work]]

*   **"Hopping Resume" Perception**
    Taking too many short-term contract positions can make a resume appear "hopping," which is often viewed negatively by hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Recruiters frequently hear concerns about candidates who only work six to nine months at various places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Employers often seek candidates with a commitment to long-term projects, process improvement, and the ability to build lasting relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Short-term contract employees may struggle to form these relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This concern is more relevant for those early in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

*   **Lack of Benefits**
    In most cases, contract positions do not include benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. While some agencies that place contractors may offer benefits, they are usually not as comprehensive as those provided by a large corporation for its full-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This is a significant [[financial_considerations_in_contract_vs_fulltime_work | financial consideration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

*   **Sense of Limbo and Instability**
    Being on contract can create a feeling of limbo, especially for those accustomed to full-time work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. There's a continuous need to look for the next opportunity and plan for what happens after the contract ends, particularly if conversion to full-time is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This can impact major life decisions like buying a house or having children, which often require stable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

*   **Lack of Employer Commitment/Loyalty**
    Contractors are often aware that the employer is not fully committed to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. There may be no clear career opportunities or pathways within the company beyond the contract term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This can contribute to a sense of [[challenges_of_relying_on_an_employer | reduced loyalty]] from the employer's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

*   **Not Feeling Part of the Team**
    Contract employees may feel like they don't fully belong to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Discussions about future projects or long-term forecasts can be difficult when a contractor knows they may not be there to see them through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This lack of integration can be a noticeable difference for those used to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Ultimately, the decision between contract and full-time employment requires weighing the [[pros_of_contract_work | advantages]] and [[cons_of_contract_work | disadvantages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The choice depends on personal preference, the current job market, and how frequently job opportunities are presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. For those in a difficult job search, a contract position can be a beneficial stepping stone in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

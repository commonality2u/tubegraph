Job seekers often feel that employer requirements are completely out of touch, a feeling supported by the concept of "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These are unadvertised criteria that companies use to filter candidates, often leading to [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | hiring challenges]] and frustration for applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Origin of Hidden Requirements

Hidden job requirements typically originate from the hiring manager's "wish list" during an "intake call" with a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While public job postings outline "requirements" (must-haves) and "preferred" qualifications, hidden requirements often fall under the "preferred" category, reflecting "hiring manager bias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Recruiters are responsible for taking these biases to market, though a good recruiter should push back on unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Leaked Internal Selection Guidelines Example

A case illustrating [[absurd_job_requirements_and_postings | absurd job requirements]] involved a recruiter accidentally emailing "secret internal selection guidelines" to a technical candidate for a software development role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These guidelines, provided by the hiring authority, detailed specific, unadvertised criteria for candidate selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### What They Were Looking For

The internal memo outlined strict preferences and requirements:

*   **Education:**
    *   University graduate with a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   Must be from a "top program" like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, or University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   Special exception for 4.0 graduates from other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Experience:**
    *   Four to ten years of experience developing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Longevity in role, with two years plus in each position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   Significant experience in notable startups, especially those backed by Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   Bonus points for being a founding engineer or having founder experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Technical Skills:** Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), sometimes modern text like Kotlin, and knowledge of AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Eligibility:** US citizen, US permanent resident (green card holder), or Canadian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Absolutely no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Diversity:** Diversity hires (e.g., black, female) were considered a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### What to Avoid

The internal guidelines also specified candidates that would not be considered a good fit:

*   **Visa Candidates:** Candidates requiring visa sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Career Contractors:** Individuals with a background primarily in contract work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Job Hoppers:** Candidates with frequent, short stints in roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Coding Bootcamp Graduates:** Graduates from coding boot camps like Full Stack Academy or Hacked Reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Consulting Background:** Those who worked at an IT software development firm rather than a company producing direct products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Big Company Experience Only:** Candidates whose experience is limited to large companies like Uber, Intel, Google, or Facebook, unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Blacklisted Companies:** Candidates who have ever worked at specific companies, including Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, and Dell, are "scarlet-lettered" and will "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Fake Profiles:** A note was included to screen candidates properly due to an increase in fake and scam profiles in the IT world, especially with AI-assisted applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> This specific list highlights how some companies have [[confidential_job_postings | confidential job postings]] or internal requirements that differ vastly from their public job descriptions, leading to [[challenges_with_unrealistic_job_postings | unrealistic job postings]] and candidate frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Impact and Reality

Such hidden requirements make the [[job_application_challenges_and_solutions | job search challenging]] and significantly restrict the candidate pool for recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While the presented example is extreme, the speaker confirms that this level of pickiness is not uncommon in reality for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. These unlisted criteria often lead to candidates being rejected for reasons they are never aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> While this specific example is an extreme case, many companies do have hidden requirements where if a candidate has one type of experience, they may be disqualified for another, even if not explicitly stated in the public job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Advice for Job Seekers

When encountering such [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags in job advertisements]] or feeling frustrated by [[absurd_job_requirements_and_postings | absurd job requirements]], it's important for job seekers to understand that "it's them and not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

*   **Focus on Presentation:** Present a clean, direct resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Targeted Networking:** Engage in targeted networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Showcase Work:** If applicable, create a GitHub profile, portfolio, or simple website to demonstrate your skills and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Move On:** Don't dwell on unrealistic hiring managers; it's often best to move on to the next opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control:** Avoid applying for jobs with such unrealistic expectations. Companies will be forced to adjust their approach if they receive no qualified candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

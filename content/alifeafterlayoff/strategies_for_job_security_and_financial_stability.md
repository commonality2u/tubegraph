Concerns about an economic slowdown and potential layoffs are growing, with recent news suggesting a challenging period ahead for the economy and the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For those with a job worried about [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_resilience | job security]] or those seeking employment, understanding current trends is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Current Layoff Trends

Layoffs have been surging in both the federal and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

*   **Federal Workforce** The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge Department) is implementing significant cuts, impacting the federal workforce and spilling over into the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. In March alone, furloughs in the federal government totaled 216,000, part of a broader 275,200 total labor force reductions, according to Challenger Gray and Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. These cuts also have ancillary impacts on support groups and businesses that rely on government spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Private Sector** In February 2025, companies announced a collective 172,000 layoffs, a 245% increase from the previous fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Industries particularly affected include tech, retail, and hospitality, which are more susceptible to tariffs and lower consumer spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** Many corporations are laying off staff due to the economy and increasingly, the adoption of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Companies are replacing human roles with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Economic Outlook

The US economy is slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

*   **GDP Growth** Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to drop from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025, with some forecasts even showing a contraction in the first quarter of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
*   **Unemployment** The unemployment rate, currently around 4.1%, could reach 4.8% to 5% by next April due to ongoing layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Washington D.C., in particular, may see unemployment hit as high as 6.5% by mid-2026 due to federal layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation** Inflation remains around 3%, higher than the Fed's 2% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   **Tariffs and Manufacturing** Tariffs are expected to impact prices of imported goods, hitting consumer spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Manufacturing growth is also weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. However, tariffs could potentially lead to a resurgence in US manufacturing jobs as companies like Nissan walk back plans to move production overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Federal Reserve Action** The Federal Reserve is cautious, pausing rate cuts at 4.25% due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. They may cut rates to 3.5-3.75% by next April if unemployment rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.

### CFO Sentiment

A survey of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) at major corporations reveals widespread pessimism about the economy and a potential recession by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

*   **Uncertainty**: 40% of CFOs surveyed said "I don't know" when asked which sector would have the biggest growth in the next six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
*   **Pessimism**: 75% are somewhat pessimistic about the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
*   **Recession Concerns**: 60% expect a recession in the second half of 2025, and 15% foresee one in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. The majority expect it to be mild to moderate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
*   **Market Outlook**: 90% of CFOs expect the Dow to fall below 40,000 before reaching 50,000, erasing gains since August of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_planning_amid_layoffs | Strategies for Job Security and Career Planning Amid Layoffs]]

Given the shaky [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_resilience | job security]] and anticipated layoffs, having a game plan is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

1.  **Assess and Develop Skills**: Evaluate your current skills against future market needs and actively work to fill any skill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
2.  **Build Networks**: Expand your professional network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Develop Side Income Streams**: Start building additional sources of income beyond your primary paycheck to prepare for potential income disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>. An affiliate program for helping people land jobs is one example of a side income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
4.  **Prioritize [[strategies_for_financial_stability_during_job_loss | Financial Stability]]**: Set aside money now to avoid needing to tap into retirement savings like a 401k during an income disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.

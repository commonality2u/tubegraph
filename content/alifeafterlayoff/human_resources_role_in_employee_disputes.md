Human Resources (HR) departments play a specific role in organizations, particularly when employees raise concerns or disputes. This role is often misunderstood by employees, leading to unexpected outcomes when issues are reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:19">[09:19:19]</a>.

## Employee's Experience with HR

A woman named Alisyn posted a viral TikTok video detailing a toxic interaction with her boss, which escalated into a larger workplace dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She eventually reported her manager multiple times to [[human_resources_role_and_communication_during_layoffs | HR]] for alleged harassment, bullying, and discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. According to Alisyn, HR could not prove the manager was treating her badly because meetings weren't recorded, and her situation only worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. She also emailed a director, bypassing her direct manager, to express concern over lack of coverage during her PTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Eventually, she was laid off, with the company claiming financial reasons, despite her belief it was retaliation for her complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. She sent video evidence and other materials to HR, including the Vice President and Director of HR, but "nothing happened" to her manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## The Speaker's Perspective on HR's Function

The speaker emphasizes a critical understanding of HR's role:
> Human resources is not your friend. They are not the person that you go entitle to. They're not the department that is the police of the organization who's going to come in and tell bad manager to shape chip up or shape out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>

When an employee complains to HR, they are essentially putting a target on their back and are put on HR's radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

### HR Investigation Process
When an employee reports a manager for being "toxic," "discriminating," or "treating me poorly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>:
1.  **Documentation Review**: HR immediately pulls the employee's file to understand their background, tenure, performance appraisals, and any documented coaching or performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This highlights the [[documentation_in_human_resources | importance of documentation]] in HR.
2.  **Senior Leader Consultation**: They then speak with the senior leader of the department to get their thoughts on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
3.  **Manager Interview**: Next, HR meets with the accused manager to share the complaint and gather their facts and perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

If the complaint is based on emotional feelings rather than concrete evidence, HR is less likely to take action against the manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

## EEOC Involvement

Alisyn also contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) but her case was not investigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. The speaker explains that the EEOC is "very much employee focused," operating on the principle that "the employer is guilty until proven innocent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. If the EEOC declines to investigate, it signifies that there was "absolutely no case" of discrimination based on their strict definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. For an EEOC investigation to proceed, the discrimination must be explicit, such as discriminatory language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

## Employee Actions and Consequences

Several actions taken by the employee in this case illustrate how an employee can inadvertently escalate a situation and negatively impact their career:
*   **Recording without Consent**: Alisyn recorded conversations with her manager without the manager's knowledge, which can lead to "serious legal hot water" if not done with permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.
*   **Delegating Upward**: The employee attempted to assign tasks to her boss, which can "rub a manager the wrong way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.
*   **Confrontational Communication**: Her [[handling_conflict_with_a_manager | communication style]] with her manager became confrontational, showing a lack of professional respect in the [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employer-employee relationship dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>.
*   **Bypassing Management**: Going to HR twice and to a senior director about her manager's performance caused her to be perceived as a "problem" by HR, her boss, and the senior director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>.
*   **Public Shaming**: Posting highly critical videos about her former employer and specific individuals on platforms like TikTok and LinkedIn, tagging CEOs, is seen as "scarlet lettering herself" within the industry, making it difficult to find future employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a>. Recruiters and hiring teams actively check social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the employee was laid off, a situation that aligns with the topic of [[handling_of_layoffs_by_human_resources | handling of layoffs by human resources]] and [[human_resources_role_and_communication_during_layoffs | HR communication during layoffs]]. The speaker suggests that the employee was deemed the problem, leading to her removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:00">[33:58:00]</a>.

## Conclusion and Advice for Employees

While experiencing a "toxic boss" or "toxic workplace" is common, it is crucial for employees to manage such situations strategically. The speaker advises against "blowing up your entire career" over one bad employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>. Instead of recording or posting publicly, it is often better to quietly update a resume and seek new opportunities, leaving the negative experience in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16:00">[40:16:00]</a>. Public complaints can label an individual as a "toxic candidate," hindering future job prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>.

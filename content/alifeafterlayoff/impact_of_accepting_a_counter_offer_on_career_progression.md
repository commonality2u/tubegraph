When you're unhappy at work and explore new opportunities, you might receive an offer from another company. Upon informing your current employer, they may scramble to present a counter offer, promising things like a new job title or a larger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, accepting such an offer can significantly impact your career progression negatively.

## Why You Should Never Accept a Counter Offer

A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises against accepting a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This advice is based on real-life knowledge and statistics, as many candidates who accept a counter offer find themselves back on the job market within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Statistics on Counter Offer Outcomes
According to LinkedIn, an overwhelming majority of people who accept counter offers do not remain with their company long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   **Over 80%** won't be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **93%** won't be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

These statistics highlight the significant [[potential_risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | potential risks of accepting a counter offer]] and the high likelihood of returning to a job search soon after.

## Reasons Not to Accept a Counter Offer

### Unresolved Core Issues Persist
The fundamental reasons you sought a new job will likely still exist, even with a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These include:
*   A bad boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Poor company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Work-life balance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   An undesirable commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   Terrible benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

If these were the motivators for your job search, they will probably remain even after a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While there might be a temporary "honeymoon period," the original issues tend to resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Your Employer Was Undervaluing You
A crucial question to ask is why your employer is only countering now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This suggests they were undervaluing you until you threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It indicates they might have taken you for granted or taken advantage of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Damage to Relationships and Future Prospects
Accepting a counter offer can permanently alter your relationships and standing within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Loss of Trust:** Your boss and senior leaders may now view you as less committed to the business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, potentially passing you over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Redundancy Risk:** By broadcasting your intention to leave, you have made yourself a "flight risk." Your employer will likely develop a contingency plan or search for your replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This makes you vulnerable to adverse employment decisions, especially if the company faces a rough patch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Even if you receive a promotion or expanded responsibilities as part of the counter offer, your long-term career prospects can be negatively affected. The promised role might just be a temporary measure to keep you satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Be Selfish With Your Career
It's important to be selfish with your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Companies can lay off long-tenured employees with little to no warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Leaving a bad boss, poor work culture, or dying industry is not just the right thing to do, but the smart thing for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Just as an old relationship ended for a reason, remember why you started looking for a new job in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Looking forward to new beginnings is often the best approach for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

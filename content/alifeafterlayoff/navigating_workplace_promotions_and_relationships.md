[[The Reality of Workplace Relationships | Workplace relationships]] can be complex, and caution is advised when forming friendships and sharing information with colleagues to protect one's career prospects and maintain professional credibility.

## The Pitfalls of Oversharing: A Personal Account
The speaker recalls their first job as an HR professional at a manufacturing and global engineering company, where they traveled to various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Their role involved recruiting and handling employee relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. During one rotation, they befriended a line worker who was about their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

After developing a good rapport, the speaker accepted an invitation to go out with this colleague and their friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. During the outing, the conversation turned to work, and the colleague asked about a new, inexperienced supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The speaker made an "innocent" comment about the supervisor still growing in their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The following week, the speaker's boss informed them that the colleague had reported the comment, stating the speaker was "spreading rumors" and "didn't have any faith" in the new leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This incident created a credibility issue and necessitated an apology to the supervisor to maintain an effective working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Workplace Relationships

### The Danger of Oversharing
Even seemingly innocent comments, when overshared, can find their way back to management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. If a boss hears through the grapevine that an employee is not to be trusted, it can lead to a significant credibility issue, potentially stunting long-term career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. It is crucial to avoid building a reputation of being untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Avoiding Office Gossip
Office gossip is prevalent in every workplace, and identifying those involved is typically easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Engaging in "water cooler talk" with gossips often leads to oversharing or making regrettable comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. More importantly, association with gossips can brand an individual as one, impacting their reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

*   **You are who you hang out with:** If aspiring for [[navigating_leadership_and_promotion_dynamics | upward career mobility]], it's advisable to avoid associating with gossips or those who are not focused on progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Leadership teams are aware of workplace cliques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Minimize engagement:** When encountering gossips at common areas like the water cooler, it's best to retrieve what's needed, exchange pleasantries, and leave to avoid being drawn into drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As an HR professional, the speaker often found office gossips to be the "usual suspects" in employee relations issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Steering Clear of Negativity
Office gossips often harbor negative mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Spending too much time with such individuals can be detrimental, as they tend to complain about bosses, companies, and work conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These negative individuals can act as a "cancer" within a group, especially for those focused on [[navigating_leadership_and_promotion_dynamics | upward mobility]], and should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Navigating [[navigating_leadership_and_promotion_dynamics | Promotions]]
Workplace relationships can become highly competitive, especially when a [[navigating_leadership_and_promotion_dynamics | promotion]] opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. If you secure a promotion over a colleague with whom you've been overly friendly, it can create awkwardness and compromise your position, especially if they possess "dirty secrets" about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. An unscrupulous colleague could potentially use shared information to hold you "hostage," or jealousy could hinder your progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Caution at Social Events
Be especially careful at events like happy hours or other off-work gatherings with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Alcohol can lead to "loose lips" and inappropriate behavior, blurring the line between friendliness and harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. An off-color joke, even if unintentional, can offend someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

> "Anything that you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

While it's possible to maintain friendships with co-workers, it's crucial to select them carefully and be cautious about behavior, speech, and shared information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

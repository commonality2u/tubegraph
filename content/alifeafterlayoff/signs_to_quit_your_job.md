This article compiles various "red flags" from a Reddit forum, originally featured in a Buzzfeed article, that indicate it might be time to quit your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Some situations may warrant an immediate departure, even without a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Key Indicators It's Time to Leave

### Dreading Work & Career Dissatisfaction
Dreading going to work can signal that you're not in the right career path or that the specific employer is not a good match for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. If this dread stems from a deeper career dissatisfaction, it's crucial to assess your long-term career choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Financial Instability of the Employer
When your paycheck is late or bounces, it's a significant sign to leave immediately, as there's no guarantee you'll be paid on time or at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Boss Micromanagement & Performance Pressure
A boss demanding daily meetings to prove your worth and discuss making the company more money, especially for a barely livable wage, suggests a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If your boss doesn't believe in you and is micromanaging to this extent, it's an [[indicators_of_being_pushed_out_at_work | indicator that you likely don't have a future there]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This situation often resembles a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Layoffs and Company Loyalty
If the nicest, most loyal, and experienced person in your department is laid off, especially due to salary, it signals that the company is cutting costs and loyalty is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Such actions undermine years of loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. If you survive layoffs but witness this treatment, it's wise to consider updating your resume, as a company that shows no loyalty to hard-working employees is a "sinking ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Better Job Offers
While a higher-paying job isn't always the best opportunity (sometimes staying for experience is more beneficial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, a massive raise offer is often a valid reason to consider leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, be aware that those with the highest salaries might be prioritized for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Impact on Mental Health
Invasive thoughts about work while at home or off the clock, such as worrying about emails, meetings, or being fired, are strong [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | indicators of an unhealthy environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Your mental and physical health must come first, and no job is worth jeopardizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Lack of Career Progression
When there's no progression in your position and less experienced individuals are promoted over you, despite your qualifications and performance, it's a clear sign you're being blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. If you desire advancement, this is a reason to update your resume and seek another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Staying stagnant can cause the market to pass you by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### New Hires Earning More
It's common, especially in larger corporations, for new hires to make more money than existing employees in similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This is because wages on the open market often move faster than internal compensation adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While internal raises might be 2-4% and promotions 10%, job hopping can lead to 15-20% raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Use job hopping strategically early in your career, but avoid overdoing it as too much can hurt your resume long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Frequent Management Changes
Constant changes in management, particularly your direct boss or their boss, can be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. New leaders often bring their own philosophies and people, which means your fit for the role under a new vision might be uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It's advisable to be cautious and keep your resume updated in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Abusive Authority
Working for someone with anger issues or who yells at employees is a self-respect issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. If a senior leader or your boss verbally abuses you, it indicates a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic work environment]] with no benefit to staying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### "We're All Family Here" Trope
The phrase "we're all family here" from an employer is often a manipulation tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. In reality, work relationships are mutually beneficial arrangements, not family bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Employees are "free agents" who should prioritize their own best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Increased Responsibility Without Pay
Being given more responsibility and a new title without a corresponding raise in pay is often a sign that the company wants to avoid hiring more staff and wants to stretch their dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While you might ride this out briefly to gain a better job title and resume bullet points, don't stay too long, as you risk losing control of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### Disregard for Work-Life Balance
A boss who "forgets" about your planned vacation and expects you to work, especially when it was discussed months in advance, indicates a lack of respect for work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. It's important to set firm boundaries in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Diminishing Perks and Benefits
If company perks are disappearing and remaining ones are being threatened, it suggests the company is "de-vesting" in its employees rather than investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. A healthy work culture shows investment through improving benefits, reasonable wages that keep up with inflation, and opportunities for development and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The absence of these indicates a lack of a solid future at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Acting as a Free Agent
Ultimately, employees should act as free agents, prioritizing what's best for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If you find yourself in a [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic situation]], with a bad boss, or being undercompensated, you must take steps to address it strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

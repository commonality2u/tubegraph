An extreme example of a job application form highlights numerous [[red_flags_in_job_descriptions | red flags]] and illegal questions, serving as a critical warning sign for job seekers to [[identifying_lowquality_job_postings | identify low-quality]] or [[fake_job_postings | fake job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This particular form was sent by an international company recruiting for a US-based remote role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Even if an international company recruits in the United States, they must adhere to US laws and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Key Warning Signs in Job Applications

### Company Structure and Application Process
*   **Absence of a Talent Acquisition Department**: If a large corporation does not have a dedicated talent acquisition department and recruitment is handled directly by Human Resources (HR), this can be a [[recognizing_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] for a potentially "scammy" or [[identifying_lowquality_job_postings | low-quality employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This is more common in localized factory settings but unusual for large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Manual Application Forms (No ATS)**: A manual form sent for completion, rather than an application through an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or an online portal, is another [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Illegal and Invasive Questions
Several questions on job applications, particularly in the United States, are illegal as they have no bearing on a candidate's ability to perform the job and can lead to discrimination. If encountered, these are significant [[recognizing_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

*   **Marital/Civil Status**: Questions about an applicant's civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, significant other) are completely illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Such information has no bearing on job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Children/Family Status and Childcare**: Asking if an applicant has children, how many minors, or if they have childcare for working hours is highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This is because employers have been known to discriminate against individuals with children, perceiving them as taking more time off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate based on family status or pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The correct way to assess availability is to state job requirements (e.g., specific work hours) and ask if the applicant can meet them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Passport, Nationality, and Country of Birth**: Inquiries about an applicant's passports, nationalities, or country of birth/origin are generally illegal in the US due to anti-discrimination laws related to national origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The appropriate question is whether the applicant is legally able to work in the country without sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. While travel requirements may necessitate a valid passport, asking for specific nationality details goes too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Age**: Requesting an applicant's age, even for stated "Visa purposes," is completely illegal on a US job application due to ageism concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Religion**: Questions about an applicant's religion, or whether their religion has changed since birth, are illegal as religion is a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate based on religious beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Height and Weight**: While not directly illegal in all cases, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) states that height and weight requirements can disproportionately limit employment opportunities for protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Unless directly related to a job requirement, such inquiries should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions and History**: Asking about medical conditions, medications, medical history, or upcoming surgeries is highly invasive and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

### Financial Red Flags
*   **Asking for Money or Cashing Checks**: Be extremely cautious if a company asks you to cash any checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This is a common tactic in [[fake_job_postings_and_why_they_exist | fake job postings and why they exist]] to scam individuals.

## What to Do If You Encounter These [[red_flags_in_job_descriptions | Red Flags]]

If you encounter any of these [[red_flags_in_job_descriptions | red flags]] in a job application or interview, it's essential to:
*   **Vet the Opportunity**: Cross-reference information with the company's official corporate website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Identify Real People**: Try to confirm that actual, real people work at the company and are associated with the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Avoid Pursuit**: Employers exhibiting these [[red_flags_in_job_descriptions | red flags]] are likely unprofessional, potentially scams, or even trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. It's advisable to avoid pursuing opportunities with such entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

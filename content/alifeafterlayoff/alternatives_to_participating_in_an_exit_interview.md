When you tender your resignation and are preparing to leave your job, Human Resources may ask you to participate in an [[purpose_of_exit_interviews | exit interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While their stated intention is to collect data on overall trends within the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, such as compensation or benefits issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, or problems with a particular manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, there are significant [[risks_and_drawbacks_of_participating_in_exit_interviews | risks and drawbacks of participating in exit interviews]] for the departing employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Why Decline an Exit Interview?

Generally, it is not recommended to participate in an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> due to two main reasons:

### 1. It is Not Required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
Companies cannot compel you to participate in an exit interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. They cannot withhold your paycheck or take any adverse action against you if you decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Participation is strictly voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### 2. Potential Harm to the Employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
You stand to gain almost nothing from participating, but you can potentially lose something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

*   **Risk of Burning Bridges:** An exit interview can become an opportunity to vent frustrations about a "jerk" boss, lack of promotional opportunities, underpayment, or a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, by "spewing all this stuff out," you are creating a document of gripes that will be associated with your employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This documented negativity could burn a bridge with the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Impact on Future Re-employment:** If you ever consider returning to that employer in the future, they will likely reference these documents regarding why you quit and how you went about quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Negative feedback could shift you from being in good standing to being deemed "not hirable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Irrelevance to Future Employers:** Information from your exit interview is generally not shared with new employers during reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Companies can face legal trouble if they disclose a bunch of reasons why you left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, opening them up to liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Feedback May Fall on Deaf Ears:** The human resources representative conducting the interview often gets paid less and doesn't make major decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. While you might hope the information reaches higher-ups to incite change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, it generally "falls on deaf ears" and may only make you feel better in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Employer Should Already Know:** If you are leaving due to valid issues within a department, your employer should already be aware of these problems through regular one-on-one syncs and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If your departure comes as a surprise to your boss despite ongoing issues, "shame on the boss for not being more aware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## When to Consider Participating

If you are 100% certain you will never return to that employer in the future and you genuinely wish to "tell them how it is," then you may choose to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This might be your only real opportunity to express your thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

Given that exit interviews are voluntary and pose potential risks to your professional standing without offering significant benefit, the recommended alternative is simply to decline participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Preserving your relationship with a past employer is generally beneficial, as you "never know what's going to happen in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

If you dislike your job, instead of immediately quitting, some new concepts and strategies are emerging that might offer alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's important to evaluate your work situation if you're unhappy with your role, employer treatment, compensation, or the hours you're forced to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

## Quiet Quitting

Quiet quitting is a recent phenomenon, considered an extension of the Great Resignation, where employees effectively quit their jobs without actually resigning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. It involves reducing your output to the minimum acceptable standard necessary to maintain your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This means doing just enough to get by, not taking on extra tasks or burdens, and relieving yourself of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Motivations for Quiet Quitting

Individuals opt to quietly quit for several reasons:
*   **Re-evaluation of Work's Role** During the pandemic, many professionals began to view their jobs simply as a source of income to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding their utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This shift in perspective means employees no longer consider themselves to "live to work," but rather "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. They recognize that their company is not their family and are shedding expectations of grueling hours they once accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   **Pushback Against Exploitation** After years of feeling exploited by employers through late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty, many employees are making a deliberate decision to stop allowing companies to squeeze free labor out of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This represents a "secret resistance" against the prior "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   [[career_dissatisfaction_and_job_burnout | Burnout]] **and Overwork** Following widespread layoffs in 2020, remaining employees often had to pick up the slack, leading to [[career_dissatisfaction_and_job_burnout | burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Quiet quitting allows individuals to pull back and establish employment boundaries, reclaiming work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Market Conditions** A hot labor market has provided employees with greater [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_resilience | job security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Additionally, the rise of remote work makes it more challenging for managers to monitor the effort employees put into their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Employers are often unable to backfill positions, viewing "some output as better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Preferred Strategy: Strategic Exit

While quiet quitting is a recognized phenomenon, it is generally recommended to "treat yourself like a free agent and upgrade your situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This involves a more proactive approach to addressing job dissatisfaction:
*   **Keep Your Resume Up-to-Date** Maintaining a current resume is crucial for being prepared to explore new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
*   **Strategically Plan Your Exit** Instead of simply reducing effort, plan your departure from an unsatisfactory role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This can involve job searching while still employed.

This approach acknowledges that companies are being forced to re-evaluate how they treat employees, as the traditional loyalty to a single company for 20+ years has become antiquated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Staying too long with one company can lead to falling behind the employment curve and on compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

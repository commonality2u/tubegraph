To advance your career, it's often necessary to embrace a more [[being_selfish_in_your_career | selfish mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means [[importance_of_acting_like_a_free_agent | acting like a free agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> and taking [[taking_ownership_of_your_career | ownership of your career]] as if you are its CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Why a Free Agent Mentality is Crucial

The current labor market, especially since the last 6 to 8 months, has seen a definitive softening, with widespread layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, which is expected to spill over into other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Companies have not learned from past mistakes, often handling layoffs with a lack of dignity and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Examples of Poor Corporate Behavior
*   **Google Layoffs**: An employee of over 10 years was forced to return to the office, only to discover their layoff when their badge failed to work at the building entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This showed extreme disrespect, wasting the employee's time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Layoffs During Business Trips**: Individuals on company business trips have been notified of their layoff while away from home, causing significant embarrassment and logistical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Layoffs During Labor**: One particularly distasteful story involved a person being laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Recruited and Laid Off**: A person left their company to join Google, only to be laid off 13 weeks later, demonstrating how quickly careers can be derailed without accountability from hiring companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Zillow's Hiring Cycle**: Zillow laid off recruiting staff in late 2022 and then almost immediately posted the same jobs, refusing to rehire the previously laid-off employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This highlights a lack of accountability and poor forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

These instances contribute to widespread dissatisfaction among employees, as companies are perceived to be "jerking people around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

### The Death of Corporate Loyalty
[[career_advancement_and_company_loyalty | Corporate loyalty]] is a concept that died with the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The days of working for the same company for 20-40 years with a pension are gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Companies operate on an "instant gratification" and "what have you done for me lately" basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Layoffs occur swiftly when things get tough, followed by rushed rehiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Companies view employees as "human resources" or "numbers on a spreadsheet," eliminating positions without hesitation once usefulness ceases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

> "You don't owe your employer anything other than an honest day's work for an honest day's pay." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>

## Embracing the Free Agent Mentality

[[necessity_of_being_a_career_free_agent | Acting like a free agent]] means always prioritizing your best interests first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. There's nothing wrong with [[being_selfish_in_your_career | being selfish in your career]], as no one else will look out for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

### Holding Companies Accountable
You can hold companies accountable by carefully choosing which offers to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. When interviewing, assess how they've behaved in the past and present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

### Case Study: A Career Success Story
An individual, laid off unexpectedly in November, was able to secure multiple job offers and a $50,000 raise within five weeks through proactive networking and resume updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Even after accepting an offer and starting a new job, they continued with interviews for other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This led to an even stronger offer, nearly $100,000 more than their original job, which prompted the advice to [[importance_of_acting_like_a_free_agent | act like a free agent]] and take the best opportunity for their career goals, regardless of how recently they started a new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

> "Treat yourself like a free agent and take the better opportunity, whatever you think is the best opportunity for you given your career goals." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>

This demonstrates the [[the_importance_of_selfadvocacy_in_career_progression | importance of self-advocacy]] and the strategic advantage of always thinking for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

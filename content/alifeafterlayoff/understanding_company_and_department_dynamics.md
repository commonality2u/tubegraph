When interviewing for a new position, it is crucial for job seekers to actively [[evaluating_company_culture_during_interviews | evaluate the company]] and department dynamics. As a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, it's noted that candidates who don't ask questions often show a lack of engagement, which hiring managers dislike [00:00:44]. More importantly, asking critical questions allows you to screen the employer and prevent accepting a "bad job" that could set your career back for years [00:01:03]. The best candidates often make the interviewer feel like they are being interviewed themselves, indicating a proactive mindset [00:01:32].

The goal is to gather reconnaissance and data points to make the best possible decision for your career [00:02:56]. Here are key questions to ask to gain insight into the **main_topic**:

## Assessing Departmental Stability and Growth

One of the first questions to ask is **"Why is this position open?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The answer provides significant insight into the [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | dynamic of the department]] you would be joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Previous employee termination or quit:** If the prior incumbent was terminated, laid off, or quit, it offers clues about underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. If they quit, it's worth asking "why did they quit the job?" to understand if the work itself was unsatisfactory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. If terminated, inquire "why did they get terminated, what things were they not successful in?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Added headcount:** If the position is an added headcount, it typically indicates that the department or company is growing, which is generally a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Understanding Departmental Vision and Challenges

To understand the strategic direction and current state of the department, ask:

*   **"What is your vision for this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> This question helps uncover the hiring manager's long-term vision for the position and the reasons behind its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **"What's one weakness that you currently have in your department?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> You can also ask about departmental strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This line of questioning helps you determine if your skills align with the department's needs and where you could fit in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **"How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating some of the strengths?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> This allows you to assess your alignment with their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Measuring Success and Career Path

It's vital to ensure you are entering a reasonable situation where you can be set up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

*   **"How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> This helps confirm that expectations are realistic and attainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If expectations seem unreasonable, it might indicate a [[assessing_company_reputation_and_culture | red flag employer]] and could lead to [[high_turnover_in_departments | quick turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **"What is it about that person that made them so successful in this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> (if someone was previously in the role and promoted or moved on) Listening closely to the answer provides a roadmap for your own potential success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **"Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> While not asking about promotions too early, it's reasonable to understand your long-term career path and ensure the role isn't a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Vetting Leadership Style

[[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | Vetting your potential boss]] is crucial to ensure alignment with their leadership style and a good long-term fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

*   **"What would you describe your leadership style as?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   **"If I was to go out into your department and ask some of your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> This question helps assess the manager's self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Understanding Organizational Strategy and Stability

Before accepting an offer, it's critical to understand the organization's strategic direction and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. You don't want to join a company without clear direction or one on shaky ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

*   **Strategic Response to Competitors:** After doing some homework on the company's competitors and any industry-shaking technologies, ask: **"I noticed that one of your competitors came out with a really intriguing new product, process, or idea. How is this company planning to address that and stay in front of the market?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> A respectable company should be aware of competitors and have a strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A lack of awareness is a [[company_communication_breakdown | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Top Concern:** **"If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> This provides significant insight into what's truly happening behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Asking these types of questions throughout the interview process, rather than only at the end, can foster a more engaging, two-way dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This approach not only demonstrates your engagement but also provides crucial information to help you land the best possible offer and a role that aligns with your career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

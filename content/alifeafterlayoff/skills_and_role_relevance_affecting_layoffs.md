One significant reason employees may face [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoffs]] is due to the obsolescence of their skills or the diminishing need for their specific role within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This differs from a direct [[performance_and_layoffs | performance issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## How Skills and Roles Become Obsolete

Companies may decide to include an employee on a layoff list if their skills are no longer needed, or if the organization has evolved beyond the necessity of certain job types or roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. If an individual has not adapted with market changes, they can easily find themselves vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This trend is expected to accelerate with the increasing prevalence of AI in the workplace, making it a "adapt or be left behind" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Staying Relevant to Avoid Layoffs

To mitigate the risk of being laid off due to skill or role obsolescence, individuals should proactively:
*   **Monitor Industry Trends** Pay close attention to the general direction of the industry and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Acquire New Skills** Ensure possession of the latest software and technical skills that are in demand across the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Adapt to Company Evolution** Observe how one's own company is evolving and be ready to reskill to become an expert in new software or technologies being adopted internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Maintaining current skills helps reduce the likelihood of being targeted for layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Skills and Cost-Cutting Measures

In some cases, individuals, particularly [[impact_of_layoffs_on_latecareer_professionals | senior professionals]], may be targeted in cost-cutting measures if their skills have atrophied or haven't kept pace with the market, while their salary remains high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Companies may view this as an easy decision to replace them with a cheaper alternative, especially since payroll is a significant company expense, heavily scrutinized during times of economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Disruptive technologies like AI further contribute to the potential elimination of positions due to skill relevance and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

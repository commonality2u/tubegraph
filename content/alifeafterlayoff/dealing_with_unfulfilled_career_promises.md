Taking ownership of one's career and [[acting_like_a_free_agent_for_career_advancement | acting like the CEO of one's career]] is a critical lesson often learned from personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Many individuals have stories of taking a wrong turn that set them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Analyzing these experiences can lead to better career management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Promise of Advancement
The speaker recounts an early career opportunity where he was recruited into a small company in the railroad services industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. He accepted the Staffing and Development Manager role, which effectively became a Human Resources Manager position, offering valuable experience and significant business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The premise for taking the job was a clear succession plan: he was to learn from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was scheduled to retire in 18 months, after which the speaker would be promoted into that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The work environment was generally supportive and family-oriented, with a high degree of freedom and a laid-back atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The VP, while particular, showed a high degree of empathy for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Unfulfilled Expectations and [[Career Stagnation and Regret | Career Stagnation]]
Despite the initial promise, the Vice President did not retire as planned. After 18 months, it became clear he had no intention of leaving, driven by his "little kingdom" and influence within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This situation mirrored a broader trend within the organization, where a tier of senior leaders, including those in functional divisions, were delaying retirement due to high bonuses and a reluctance to relinquish control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The speaker, along with his peers, was part of a leadership development group intended for succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, these senior leaders would tell candidates, "you're not ready yet," while secretly discussing how no one was capable of taking over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This lack of genuine development opportunities left the speaker largely on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

One by one, peers from the leadership development group who took ownership of their careers began to leave the organization, with some achieving significant roles elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Only a fraction of the succession group actually reached the promised level within that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Personal Apathy and Its [[Brutal Truths About Career Management | Consequences]]
The speaker, however, remained, feeling comfortable with a steady job and a supportive boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He waited for the opportunity that had been promised, telling himself he just needed to "bide my time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. What was supposed to be 18 months turned into nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

After about seven years, he gave up on his dream of becoming the head of HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He eventually transitioned to a different role within the company for his last two years, focusing on marketing and creative work, an opportunity that arose when a senior leader recognized his [[evaluating_career_dissatisfaction | dissatisfaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. His former boss remained in his role for another two years after the speaker left, eventually hiring a replacement only to continue "hovering" over him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

The speaker regrets how he handled his career during this period, becoming apathetic and comfortable, not pushing for what he wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. He realizes he was not [[acting_like_a_free_agent_for_career_advancement | acting like the CEO of his career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This inaction led to him falling behind his peer group, who were advancing to director-level roles while he remained at a manager level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Constantly being told "you're not ready" made him start to believe it, despite his peers proving their readiness by succeeding elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

He lost his passion for human resources and went into autopilot, performing his duties but no longer caring to go above and beyond or volunteer for new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This comfort led to a cessation of proactive career decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. He stopped learning, keeping up with industry trends, or acquiring new skills, which left him behind when he eventually re-entered the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## The Cost of Waiting
Upon leaving the organization, the speaker discovered he was significantly behind his peers in terms of skills, knowledge, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. He had to take a step down in responsibility to gain the necessary recruiting experience, effectively "rebranding" himself at a recruiter level while his peers moved into senior director roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This career mistake set him back by a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

The financial [[consequences of unrealistic salary expectations | implications]] were substantial, costing him thousands of dollars in lost income due to being under-compensated and two levels behind where he should have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Lessons on Career Ownership
The core lesson is the importance of playing "chess" with one's career rather than "checkers," meaning having a plan and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The speaker wished he had had guidance to get a plan and not wait for the unfulfilled promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

The "runway" in one's career shortens quickly, especially by mid-career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Waiting around for opportunities or recognition, or becoming too comfortable in a role, means wasting valuable time and not [[acting_like_a_free_agent_for_career_advancement | acting like the CEO of your career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This applies particularly to those who are "too good at their job" and kept stuck in a role by their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

To avoid these pitfalls, it's crucial to:
*   Consistently test the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   [[acting_like_a_free_agent_for_career_advancement | Entertain other opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   Keep oneself as available as possible for the best opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

This proactive approach ensures individuals are not relying on unfulfilled promises and are actively shaping their career trajectory.

Performance appraisals play a critical role in evaluating an employee's standing within a company and can serve as a leading indicator of [[challenges_of_job_security_in_modern_employment | job security]]. Signs of potential termination often manifest through declining performance metrics and formal appraisal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Key Indicators from Performance
### Declining Metrics
One of the first signs of potential job insecurity is a significant drop in an employee's metrics, especially when compared to co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. In large corporations, departments often publish measurable targets such as sales quotas or other productivity metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. If an individual's productivity is consistently and significantly behind their peer group, their name is likely to be on a list for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Continuous underperformance compared to colleagues will draw attention from both immediate managers and their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Boss's Displeasure and Work Redistribution
A sudden dissatisfaction from a boss regarding an employee's work quality is another crucial indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This can lead to [[proactive_steps_to_address_job_performance_concerns | work redistribution]], where an employee is removed from supporting clients or projects they were previously involved with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This signifies a loss of faith in the employee's ability to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Additionally, being excluded from key discussions or meetings that were once standard participation signals that a manager is interjecting to do damage control or distance the employee from projects and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. "Weirdness" or evasiveness from cross-functional leaders also indicates a potential issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Formal Performance Appraisals as Documentation
A drastic slip in performance appraisals is a significant red flag indicating that preparations for potential termination are underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

### Documentation for Dismissal
If an employee with a history of decent performance appraisals suddenly receives a much lower, highly critical appraisal, it's a cause for concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This often means the manager is actively documenting the employee's dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. When HR professionals are approached by a manager wanting to terminate an employee for underperformance, their first step is to review the employee's file, particularly recent performance appraisals, to check for documented declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

A sudden decision to terminate without a clear paper trail of performance issues can appear rash and increase liability for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Therefore, HR typically requires managers to conduct and document coaching sessions, ensuring these are reflected in subsequent performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This establishes a "paper trail" to defend any adverse employment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Performance Improvement Process (PIP)
The final formal step before termination for performance-related issues is often the implementation of a Performance Improvement Process (PIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. A PIP is a defined period with specific, measurable goals that an employee must meet to retain their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The goals are typically very clear, allowing for objective measurement of success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

Failure to meet the metrics set forth in the PIP almost invariably leads to termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. However, an employee who takes the PIP seriously and genuinely improves their performance can successfully complete it, return to the regular workforce, and work to distance themselves from the period of poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Nonetheless, being placed on a PIP is a major red flag that demands serious attention and a proactive [[strategies_for_job_security_and_skill_development | response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

If any of these signs appear, it is crucial to consider [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_resilience | immediate action]], either by addressing performance issues directly or by exploring new employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

To effectively manage your career and compensation, it's crucial to stay updated on market trends and know your worth. This involves actively engaging with the job market, even when you're satisfied with your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Acting like the CEO of your career means always keeping tabs on what the market is doing, as staying in one job for too long can lead to the market passing you by in terms of both career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Why Proactive Market Engagement is Key

Employers often delay proper compensation until an employee indicates an intention to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Many companies operate with a "pay lagger" philosophy, where they don't prioritize competitive pay or retention, often leading to significant underpayment if employees don't actively seek external offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Regularly checking the open market helps you determine if you are underpaid relative to current market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### The Cost of Stagnation

Companies that constantly replace employees incur higher costs in recruiting, training, and lost institutional knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, internal salary growth often lags behind external market increases. New talent joining a company might receive significantly higher raises (10-20%) compared to internal promotions (5-10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Long-tenured employees receiving only small annual cost-of-living adjustments (1-3%) effectively lose purchasing power due to inflation and fall behind market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Recruiters frequently observe internal departments being 20-30% below market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The "Every Two Years" Strategy

It is recommended to [[navigating_salary_expectations_in_interviews | test the open market]] at least once every two years, even if you are satisfied with your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This strategy involves:
*   Submitting job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Networking with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Participating in interview processes to understand current skill demands and assessment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Aiming to receive job offers to assess your market value and identify if you are underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Leveraging External Offers Cautiously

While getting an offer helps determine your market worth, it's important to use this information carefully. Constantly using every small offer to demand a raise from your current employer could lead them to call your bluff and suggest you take the other job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, if a significant offer comes through, like a $15/hour raise, it can be a powerful tool for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

For instance, one individual who spent seven to eight years with an employer, despite being a top performer, discovered through an external offer of $5/hour more that their employer was willing to provide a $15/hour raise to retain them due to high departmental turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While generally, accepting a counter-offer is not recommended, a substantial increase combined with comfort in an existing role, vested benefits, and known processes can make it a compelling option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

A pre-screen form sent by an international company for a U.S.-based remote role contained an "unbelievable" number of [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal questions]] under U.S. law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Even if an international company is recruiting in the United States, they must adhere to U.S. laws and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## [[red_flags_in_job_applications | Red Flags in Job Applications]]

Beyond the specific questions, several factors in this scenario point to a low-quality employer or potential scam:

*   **HR vs. Talent Acquisition** For a large corporation, the recruitment process being handled directly by a Human Resources (HR) department rather than a dedicated Talent Acquisition department can be a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While common in localized settings like factories, it's less typical for large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Manual Application Forms** If a company sends a manual form to be filled out instead of using an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or an online application, this is another [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Request for Money** Any request to cash checks or pay for anything yourself during the [[job_application_process_and_strategies | job application process]] should raise immediate alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Overall Impression** The presence of multiple [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] suggests the employer might be unprofessional, a scam, or even trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Regardless, such employers should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

It is important to vet any opportunity by cross-referencing information with the company's official corporate website to ensure legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Common Illegal Questions

Many questions on this particular application form are considered [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]] in the United States because they have no bearing on a candidate's ability to perform the job and can lead to discrimination.

*   **Marital/Civil Status** Asking about civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, significant other) is completely [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]] in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Employers cannot ask this question because it has no bearing on job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Family and Childcare** Questions about having children, how many, or childcare arrangements are highly [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. These questions are prohibited because employers have historically discriminated against individuals with children, fearing they might take more time off or have childcare issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Proper Alternative**: Instead of asking about family status, employers should state the job's required schedule or conditions and ask if the candidate is able to meet those requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Nationality/Country of Origin/Passport** Asking about passports held, nationality, or country of birth is generally [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]] in the U.S. because it can lead to discrimination based on national origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   **Proper Alternative**: If international travel is a job requirement, employers should state the travel requirement and ask if the candidate can meet it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The correct way to determine eligibility to work is to ask, "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Age** Asking for a candidate's age is an [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]] question in the U.S. due to age discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Religion** Inquiring about a candidate's religion, or if they have changed religions, is also an [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]] question because religion is a protected class against which employers cannot discriminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Height and Weight** While not always directly [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]], inquiries about height and weight are generally discouraged by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. These requirements can disproportionately limit opportunities for protected groups. Unless directly related to a specific job requirement (e.g., a role requiring fitting into tight spaces or lifting certain weights), they should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions** Asking about medical conditions, medications, or upcoming surgeries is highly invasive and [[illegal_questions_in_job_interviews | illegal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

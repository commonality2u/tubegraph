This article details a specific example of an application form filled with illegal questions, highlighting issues encountered in the modern job market. The information is based on a LinkedIn post shared by a talent acquisition manager who received an unbelievable job application form from an international company for a US-based remote role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Despite the company being international, it must adhere to the laws and regulations of the United States when recruiting candidates from that geographic area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The form was a real document sent by the company's HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### [[red_flags_in_job_applications | Red Flags in Job Applications]]

Several [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] were identified in this application process, indicating a potentially low-quality employer or even a scam:

*   **HR vs. Talent Acquisition** If a large corporation's hiring is handled directly by Human Resources instead of a dedicated Talent Acquisition department, it can be a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. While common for localized recruiting like factory settings, it's concerning for larger entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Absence of ATS** The lack of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and the manual distribution of forms is another [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Suspicious Financial Requests** Be wary if an employer asks you to cash checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

If these [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] appear, it's crucial to vet the opportunity thoroughly, cross-reference with the company's official website, and ensure real people are working there to avoid scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Illegal Questions on Job Applications

The application form contained numerous questions that are illegal to ask in the United States, particularly as they relate to protected classes and anti-discrimination laws. If an employer needs specific information for job requirements, they should ask about the ability to meet conditions rather than directly inquiring about protected characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Here's a breakdown of the illegal questions identified:

*   **1. Civil or Marital Status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   **Question:** "What is your civil or marital status? (single, married, divorced, separated, significant other) Add any comments." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   **Why it's illegal:** This has no bearing on an individual's ability to perform the job and is completely illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **2. Children/Family Status and Childcare** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
    *   **Question:** "Do you have any kids? If yes, how many minors? Do you have childcare for your children during working hours?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
    *   **Why it's illegal:** Asking about family status is highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate against individuals who have children or are family planning due to perceived issues like taking days off for sick children or daycare problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **How it should be asked:** Instead of asking about childcare, an employer should state the required work schedule or conditions and ask if the candidate is able to meet those requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **3. Passport Nationality and Country of Birth/Origin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
    *   **Question:** "What passports do you hold and nationality? Is your passport currently valid for travel? Please include expiration date. Country of birth or country of origin." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
    *   **Why it's illegal:** Disclosing national origin or country of birth is an illegal question in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, as it has no bearing on job ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. While international travel may be a job requirement, the question should focus on the ability to travel rather than nationality.
    *   **How it should be asked:** An employer should ask: "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. If travel is required, they should state: "This position will require you to travel to [country] on a regular basis. Are you able to meet that requirement?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **4. Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   **Question:** "Kindly indicate your age (for Visa purposes)." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   **Why it's illegal:** This is a clear case of age discrimination, which is illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **5. Religion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>
    *   **Question:** "Religion (for Visa purposes). If the religion was different at the time of birth, please provide further details." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>
    *   **Why it's illegal:** Religion is a protected class, and employers cannot discriminate based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Asking about an applicant's current or past religious beliefs is highly inappropriate and illegal.
*   **6. Height and Weight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>
    *   **Question:** "What is your height and weight?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>
    *   **Why it's illegal:** According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), height and weight requirements tend to disproportionately limit employment opportunities for some protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Unless directly related to an actual job requirement that can be demonstrated, such inquiries are viewed as illegal under federal law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Many states and municipalities specifically prohibit discrimination based on height and weight unless job-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **7. Medical Conditions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>
    *   **Question:** "Do you have any medical conditions? If so, please elaborate, mention the type of medications you're taking, maybe give me an entire medical history if you have any surgeries coming up." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>
    *   **Why it's illegal:** This is an extremely invasive and illegal question. Employers cannot ask about medical history, medications, or upcoming surgeries, as this information falls under protected health information and can lead to discrimination based on disability.

### Spotting [[questions_that_indicate_low_quality_employers | Low-Quality Employers]]

This extreme example illustrates what constitutes illegal questions and why they are problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. If job seekers encounter any combination of these or similar questions during an application or interview, it should raise a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Being aware of these types of inquiries helps identify and avoid [[questions_that_indicate_low_quality_employers | low-quality employers]] and potential scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

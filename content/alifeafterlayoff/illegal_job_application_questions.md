A common pitfall in the job application process involves encountering questions that are legally impermissible, particularly in the United States. A specific example from a LinkedIn post by a talent acquisition manager highlights just how egregious these can be, outlining a pre-screen form sent by an international company seeking a remote US-based role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the company's international base, if it recruits candidates from the United States, it must adhere to US laws and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Red Flags in the Application Process

Before even delving into the questions, several [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] can indicate a problematic employer or a potential scam:

*   **Human Resources Handling Recruitment**: If a large corporation's recruiting is managed directly by a Human Resources (HR) department rather than a dedicated talent acquisition department, it can be a [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While common in localized factory settings, it's unusual for large organizations and may suggest a "scammy role" or a lower-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Manual Forms and No ATS**: If an employer sends a form manually to be filled out, rather than using an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or an online application, this is another significant [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Suspicious Financial Requests**: Be highly aware if an employer asks you to cash checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

If these [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] appear, it is crucial to vet the opportunity thoroughly, cross-referencing with the corporate website to ensure it's a legitimate company with real people working there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Unacceptable Questions in Job Applications

The following questions, often seen in job applications, are considered illegal in the United States and should prompt caution:

### 1. Civil or Marital Status

Asking about an applicant's civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, or having a significant other) is completely illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This information has no bearing on an individual's ability to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Additionally, encouraging applicants to provide "additional context" about their personal life, like a divorce, is highly inappropriate and invasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### 2. Children and Childcare

Questions about whether an applicant has children, how many minors they have, or if they have childcare arrangements during working hours are highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Employers have been known to discriminate against individuals with children, perceiving them as taking more time off due to family obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Discrimination based on family status or pregnancy is prohibited by US law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

*   **How it should be asked**: Instead of directly inquiring about family, employers should state the position's required schedule and conditions, then ask if the applicant can meet those requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### 3. Passport, Nationality, and Country of Origin

While a job might legitimately require international travel (e.g., to China), directly asking about passports held, nationality, or country of birth/origin is illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Disclosing national origin is an illegal question, as it has no bearing on one's ability to do the job, assuming they are legally permitted to work in the country of application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

*   **How it should be asked**: A permissible question would be, "This position will require you to travel to [Country] on a regular basis. Are you able to meet that requirement?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Alternatively, regarding work eligibility, the question should be: "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### 4. Age

Asking for an applicant's age is explicitly illegal in the United States due to age discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Even if an international company claims it's for "Visa purposes," this requirement makes hiring individuals in the US problematic given US anti-discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### 5. Religion

Inquiring about an applicant's religion, or if their religion has changed since birth, is illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Religion is a protected class, and employers cannot discriminate based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### 6. Height and Weight

While not directly illegal in all cases, asking for height and weight is generally discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), height and weight requirements can disproportionately limit employment opportunities for certain protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Unless the employer can demonstrate a direct job-related necessity, such inquiries may be viewed as illegal under federal law, and many states and municipalities specifically prohibit discrimination based on height and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### 7. Medical Conditions

Asking about medical conditions, types of medications taken, entire medical history, or upcoming surgeries is highly invasive and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This information is considered private and irrelevant to a candidate's ability to perform the job, unless it pertains to reasonable accommodations after an offer of employment.

## Conclusion

Such deeply invasive and illegal questions are significant [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. An employer asking these questions is either highly unprofessional, a scam, or potentially trolling candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Job seekers should maintain a high degree of awareness and avoid pursuing opportunities with such low-quality employers, as they may also be susceptible to [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | scams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Focusing on developing a strong resume, LinkedIn presence, and job search strategy can help job seekers avoid these types of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

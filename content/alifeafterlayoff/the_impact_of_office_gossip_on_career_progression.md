The choice of workplace friendships and how one interacts with colleagues can significantly impact career progression. An individual's credibility and long-term potential can be stunted by oversharing, gossiping, or associating with negative influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>.

## Case Study: The Cost of Casual Conversation

The speaker recounts a personal experience early in their career as an HR professional in a manufacturing and global engineering company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. During a two-year nomadic rotation, they worked in a small town, frequently visiting a smaller sister facility to manage staffing and employee relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

They developed a rapport with a line worker, considering him a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. One evening, while out for drinks, the conversation turned to work, and the coworker innocently asked about a new, inexperienced supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The speaker, whose job included helping the new supervisor develop, commented that the supervisor was "still growing" and that they were "helping him with some things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

The following week, the speaker's boss informed them that the supervisor was upset, believing rumors were being spread about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. The coworker had gone directly to the supervisor, claiming the speaker "doesn't have any faith in you as a leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This incident, caused by an innocent comment, highlighted the [[consequences_of_oversharing_with_coworkers | consequences of oversharing with coworkers]] and the importance of discretion in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The speaker was required to apologize and mend the relationship with the supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Risks of Oversharing and Gossip

Even seemingly innocent [[consequences_of_oversharing_with_coworkers | oversharing]] can find its way back to management, leading to a major credibility issue for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:51">[03:45:51]</a>. An untrustworthy reputation can significantly stunt long-term [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | career potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### The Office Gossip Phenomenon

Every office typically has known gossips, often found congregating in lunchrooms or around the water cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">[04:10:04]</a>. Water cooler talk frequently involves stirring up drama and gossiping about others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>. Engaging in such conversations makes it easy to cross the line into [[consequences_of_oversharing_with_coworkers | oversharing]] or saying something regrettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>.

### Reputational Damage

Associating with office gossips can lead to being branded as one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:09">[04:41:09]</a>. As the saying goes, "you are who you hang out with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. If an individual aims for upward mobility in their [[the_impact_of_loyalty_on_career_progression | career]], they should avoid gossips and those who show little ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>. Leadership teams are aware of who belongs to which cliques, and being branded as a gossip can make it difficult to [[navigating_workplace_promotions_and_relationships | move up in the organization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:04">[04:55:04]</a>. It is advisable to limit water cooler interactions to brief hellos to avoid being drawn into drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Negative Influences

Office gossips often possess a negative mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Spending too much time with such individuals can be detrimental, as their constant complaints about the boss, company, or pay can drag others down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. These "negative people" can act as a "cancer" within a group, particularly distracting for those focused on upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### The Impact of Promotions

Workplace friendships can become competitive when promotion opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. If one friend receives a [[navigating_workplace_promotions_and_relationships | promotion]] over another, it can create awkwardness and jeopardize the friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Furthermore, a newly promoted individual might find their past oversharing used against them by a jealous or unscrupulous former coworker, potentially holding them "hostage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

### Socializing Outside of Work

Even outside of work hours, caution is advised when socializing with coworkers, especially when alcohol is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Loose lips and excessive familiarity can easily cross the line into harassment, even through an off-color joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. A long-standing adage in HR warns that anything said or done at work, or with coworkers, can later "come back to haunt you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

While it is possible to form lasting friendships at work, it is crucial to pick and choose friends carefully and maintain caution about what is said and shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

Introducing yourself, or answering the common interview question "tell me about yourself," is a crucial opportunity to set the tone for the rest of your interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:26">[02:11:26]</a>. This question, though seemingly ambiguous, is a strategic moment to demonstrate your suitability for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:03">[01:36:03]</a>.

## Why This Question Is Asked

Hiring managers often don't have a very specific agenda for this question, but it serves two main purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>:
*   **Competency** The interviewer wants to assess if you have the skills and capabilities to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.
*   **Motivational Fit** More importantly, they want to know if you are a good motivational fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:19">[02:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>.

This question is not just an icebreaker; it's a chance for you to prove you are a good fit for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>.

## What to Avoid When Introducing Yourself

To provide an [[effective_strategies_for_the_tell_me_about_yourself_interview_question | effective answer]], avoid these common pitfalls:

*   **Rehashing Your Resume** The purpose is not to go line by line through your work history, as the interviewer can read your resume for that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:19">[02:20:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>. Details about your background will be asked later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>.
*   **Giving a Life Summary** Stick to information directly related to the position you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:11">[02:38:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Avoid discussing personal stories like childhood adversity, European adventures, or hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>.
*   **Rambling** Be concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. Your answer should ideally be three to five minutes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:33">[03:07:33]</a>, preferably two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:11">[06:47:11]</a>. Long-winded answers are detrimental and can lead to being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:01">[03:15:01]</a>.
*   **Highlighting Irrelevant Information** Do not focus on things not directly related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. For example, skip details about a side hustle if it's unrelated to the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The focus should be on why you are a great fit and interested in this specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Introducing Yourself

To provide an [[effective_strategies_for_the_tell_me_about_yourself_interview_question | effective response]] and make a positive [[first_impressions_during_job_interviews | first impression]]:

## Example Answer

Consider this example for a senior-level recruiting position at a technical startup looking for someone to establish new processes and best practices:

> "I'm an expert-level recruiting professional with extensive experience in full lifecycle recruiting for a variety of industries and companies, including FAANG, Fortune 50 firms, and even some privately held companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. I'm particularly proud of my ability to build strong consultative relationships with my business partners at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, having worked with everybody from frontline leaders to C-suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. As an expert sourcer, I've utilized a full arsenal of recruiting tools, including Boolean, X-ray search, LinkedIn Recruiter, AI, and some aggregators, and even some good old-fashioned networking to help find the best candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, all the while advocating for an exemplary candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Furthermore, I have led process improvements for major ATS system upgrades and I've been instrumental in supporting a major hiring initiative which resulted in hiring 100 engineers in nine months, which was actually a full six weeks ahead of target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This position is a particular interest of mine because I've been looking to expand my skill set into the startup space and I've been seeking an opportunity to apply my skills in a new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. I'm happy to dive into anything I've mentioned more deeply, so ask away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>."

This example highlights competency, breadth of experience, and excitement for the position, effectively setting a positive tone for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. While you should have a concise summary of your experience, speak in your own voice and avoid sounding robotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

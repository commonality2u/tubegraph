It is important to evaluate your job situation and the market at least once every two years, even if you are satisfied in your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This approach encourages you to act like the CEO of your career and a "free agent," ensuring you keep tabs on market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Staying in a job for too long can lead to the market passing you by in terms of both career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Why Employers Offer Counteroffers

Employers often wait until an employee tenders their resignation before offering a significant raise or improving compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This suggests that some companies might be underpaying employees until faced with the immediate threat of losing talent, especially in tight labor markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### An Anecdotal Example

Consider an individual in the medical field who had been with their employer for seven to eight years, was a top performer, had received promotions, and was generally happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Despite their satisfaction, their department experienced nearly 100% [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] in 18 months due to high demand for their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

This individual secured an external job offer for $5 more per hour, which came with a longer commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Upon informing their current employer of their intent to leave, the employer offered a $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The employer's reasoning was a desire to retain staff amidst high [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Company Pay Philosophies

Companies typically adopt one of two pay philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>:
*   **Pay Leaders**:: These companies aim to retain top talent and can attract employees from other organizations by offering competitive compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggards**:: These companies may not prioritize retention and have [[dealing_with_high_turnover_and_job_insecurity | turnover]] built into their operational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

While a pay-laggard approach might seem cost-effective initially, constant [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] incurs significant expenses, including recruiting and training costs, and the loss of intellectual or "tribal" knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## [[understanding_counteroffers_from_employers | Accepting a Counteroffer]]

In the example above, the employee accepted the [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | counter offer]] due to the substantial $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Reasons for accepting a counteroffer often include comfort with the current organization, established equity (like vacation time and 401(k) vesting), familiarity with co-workers and processes, and the desire to avoid the "pain" of onboarding at a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

There is a general reluctance to recommend accepting counteroffers, as explored in other discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. However, a significant raise can be difficult to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### The "Grass Isn't Always Greener" Phenomenon

Sometimes, employees who leave for new opportunities find that the new company is not better, a phenomenon known as "boomeranging," where individuals return to their original employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The [[strategies_for_job_resignation_and_counter_offers | Great Resignation]] saw an increase in boomeranging, with people discovering that higher salaries didn't always equate to fulfilling work or functional company environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Importance of [[how_to_navigate_job_offers_and_counter_offers | Testing the Market]]

Even when satisfied, it is crucial to [[how_to_navigate_job_offers_and_counter_offers | test the open market]] at least once every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This involves:
*   Submitting applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Networking with recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Staying informed about market trends and required skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Understanding how your skills are assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   Determining if you are underpaid by potentially receiving a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

While obtaining an offer can confirm market value, it's advised to use this information carefully and not to continually leverage small salary differences with your current employer, as they may eventually call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Wage Stagnation and Market Trends

The external market consistently offers higher wage increases (10-20% raises for job jumpers) compared to internal promotions (5-10% at best) or cost-of-living adjustments (1-3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. As a result, individuals who remain in the same role or company for an extended period, particularly over five years, often experience [[salary_negotiation_tactics | wage stagnation]] and can find themselves significantly underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

For example, a new hire with no experience might be making the same or more than someone with five years in the same role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Additionally, current inflation means that small annual raises (1-3%) effectively result in earning less money to do the same job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Recruiters frequently observe "pay issues" within companies, where entire departments can be 20-30% below market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. If employees do not actively test the market, companies may choose not to address these pay disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

By proactively assessing your market value every couple of years, you can prevent falling too far behind current compensation trends, making it easier to catch up, and ensuring you are properly valued for your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Landing a job interview is a crucial step, and acing it is essential to avoid ending up in the "no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The job interview process can be a minefield; saying one wrong thing can sabotage your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While rejection can stem from various reasons like motivational mismatches or insufficient experience, often it's specific statements or omissions during the interview that lead to being passed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Even seemingly innocent comments can result in rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Top 10 [[common_interview_question_pitfalls | Common Interview Question Pitfalls]]

### Asking "What does the company do?"
Asking what the company does for its core business indicates a significant lack of preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Before any interview, candidates are expected to conduct basic research on:
*   The company's core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Products offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Competitors in their space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   New technologies rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

This research demonstrates interest in the company's activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Without it, it's difficult to convince an interviewer of your genuine interest in the company's mission, vision, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Additionally, researching the company's core value statement helps determine if your personal values align, which is crucial for job satisfaction and avoiding potential turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Asking this question early on creates an uphill battle for the remainder of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Asking "What is the role?"
While some details about the position are expected to be provided, interviewers anticipate that candidates have thoroughly read and understood the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Asking what the position entails or does shows a lack of preparation and leaves a poor first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Companies seek problem-solvers, not individuals who require constant guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Asking "What are the hours?"
For professional-level, salaried non-exempt positions, inquiring about work hours should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> (hourly employees may get a pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>). Even if you have legitimate concerns due to past experiences with excessive work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, asking this question can lead the company to perceive you as a "clock watcher," which is an unfavorable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Instead, frame your questions to understand work conditions without sounding like you're trying to avoid work. Consider asking about:
*   The company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   Expectations in the first 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
*   Which shift you would support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>

### Asking about Promotional Opportunities Too Soon
It's reasonable to consider future career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, but immediately asking about promotion or taking the boss's job suggests disinterest in the current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Instead, phrase questions about:
*   Career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Potential long-term growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

Ensure you convey genuine excitement for the position at hand and a desire to learn about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Asking about Salary Too Soon
While compensation is important, asking about salary at the very beginning of an interview is a major turn-off for employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, especially before understanding the position's full scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It's better to let the recruiter initiate the salary discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, as they want to avoid questioning your motivation for applying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

If you've advanced to a second interview round, the salary topic should have already been covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Asking the hiring manager about pay ranges is an even bigger [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, as the HR/TA department and hiring manager collaboratively determine fair offers, and the hiring manager rarely has the final say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Doing so might make them think you're "fishing for a better answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Not Answering Salary Expectation Questions
When asked about your salary expectations, avoiding the question or claiming ignorance about local market rates demonstrates a lack of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. You should have a clear number in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Refusing to answer or trying to delay the discussion will likely prevent you from moving to the next interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Talking Poorly About Previous Employers/Bosses
While it might be tempting to criticize past experiences, interviewers are focused on assessing your fit for their company and role, not listening to grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Speaking negatively about previous experiences is generally seen as unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Instead, maintain a gracious demeanor, highlight what you learned, and express genuine interest in the current opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Stating You Are Nervous
A certain degree of nervousness is expected during interviews, especially if you are unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Interviewers may even offer "softball questions" to help you relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. However, being overly nervous can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. At some point, you're expected to demonstrate confidence in your abilities and take ownership of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Hiring managers often have less patience for extreme nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The best advice is to be well-prepared and confident in your ability to present yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Being Too Casual
While some looseness can break the ice, being overly casual can be offensive, especially if you use inappropriate language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Treat the interview as a professional setting, not a social one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. When using first names, err on the side of caution and generally stick to how they introduced themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Never use terms like "boss" or "bro," as they can be considered derogatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Maintaining a polished and professional demeanor is the best way to make a favorable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Not Asking Questions
At the end of an interview, you will be asked if you have questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Not asking any questions indicates a lack of interest or awareness about whether you'd be a good fit for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Come prepared with a list of well-thought-out, intelligent questions about the company, its culture, and how you might integrate into the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This shows engagement in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Being prepared for the interview process is key to staying ahead and successfully landing a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

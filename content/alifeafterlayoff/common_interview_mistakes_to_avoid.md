Successfully landing a job interview is a significant achievement, but the next step is to perform exceptionally well. To hit it "out of the park," it's crucial to avoid certain [[common_interview_mistakes | common interview mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Interviewing can often feel like navigating a minefield, where one wrong step can lead to being placed in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This guide outlines what you should avoid revealing to a recruiter or hiring manager to enhance your chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Do Not Reveal Too Many Personal Facts
Oversharing personal details is often a symptom of nervousness or being long-winded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Employers often link your ability to articulate yourself in an interview to how you would perform in a business setting or meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

*   **Conciseness is Key**: Aim for interview answers that are generally two to three minutes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Avoid Bias**: Sharing too much personal information, like a hobby, can lead to the interviewer developing a bias, either for or against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While there's a chance it could be an icebreaker, it's generally best to avoid particularly personal details and keep your responses strictly related to the job at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Do Not Reveal the Real (Negative) Reason for Leaving Your Current Employer
While you shouldn't lie, it's often wise not to share the *entire* truth, especially if you're escaping a boring employer, a disliked boss, or poor company treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   **Perception Matters**: If you state your boss was "terrible" or you "butted heads," an employer might interpret this as you being difficult to work with, presenting a [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Similarly, expressing boredom with your previous role might suggest a lack of initiative, as a "go-getter" would find ways to enrich their current job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Strategic Articulation**: Figure out the true reason for your departure and articulate it in a way that doesn't seem threatening to a prospective employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Do Not Overshare Your Career Plans (If Unrelated)
Interview questions like "Where do you see yourself in five years?" aim to gauge your commitment to the career path, long-term interest, and potential for growth within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **Show Commitment**: Revealing plans to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely after a few years is generally not viewed positively and can be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Convey Passion**: Employers want to see passion for the type of work you are interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If you have future plans for a business or career shift, devise a message that doesn't undermine your current application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Do Not Reveal Desperation
Even if you're urgent to find work due to a layoff or termination, conveying desperation is akin to the dating world, where high urgency can push desired outcomes further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

*   **Maintain Composure**: Regardless of your financial situation, strive to appear calm and collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Being overly eager or revealing desperation can land you in the "no" bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Do Not Reveal Your Age (Indirectly)
Both being perceived as "too young" or "too old" can lead to age discrimination, which unfortunately still occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

*   **Resume and Digital Footprint**: Be mindful of technologies mentioned in your resume (e.g., fax numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>), the dates listed on your resume, and even your email address, as these can inadvertently indicate your age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Avoid Discussion**: Never explicitly state your age during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Do Not Reveal Years Left in the Workforce
This is particularly common for individuals in the last five to seven years of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Statements like "I just want to land this last job" or "put in 10 good years and ride off into the sunset" can create a liability for the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **Unnecessary Information**: Recruiters and hiring managers should not know such personal details about your long-term career plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Potential Bias**: If a hiring manager envisions someone staying for 10+ years and you indicate plans for only three to five, it creates a bias against you, leading to potential rejection without a clear reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Do Not Reveal Major Medical Issues or Disabilities (Unless Prompted or for Accommodation)
Generally, avoid bringing up major medical issues unless they would prohibit you from meeting the basic requirements of the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Application Process**: Employers should ask if you can meet job requirements during the application process, and you should answer truthfully if asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Legal Protections**: Laws protect against discrimination based on pregnancy or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. You don't have to disclose these conditions if they don't interfere with your job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Reasonable Accommodation**: If you require a reasonable accommodation due to a disability, it's best to bring this up at the time of an offer, not during the interview, to avoid inadvertent bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. You are hired for your ability to perform the job based on the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Do Not Reveal Your Political Belief System
It can be tempting to share your political views, especially if you think they align with the company's mission or the interviewer's viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

*   **Stay Neutral**: The political spectrum is wide, heated, and opinionated. It is always better to stay completely out of it, as you can never truly know the belief system of the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Do Not Reveal Your Previous Salary
When the salary question arises, typically during the recruiter phone screen, disclosing your previous salary can lock you into a lower compensation than you might otherwise deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

*   **Determine Your Worth**: Do not let an employer determine your value. You, as the employee, should determine your worth based on what the open market suggests for your specific skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

These insights are drawn from years of recruiting experience and aim to help you navigate job interviews successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

Understanding the implications of how you left your previous employment is crucial for success in future job interviews. Whether you quit, were fired, or were laid off, each scenario presents unique advantages and disadvantages that can influence your job search and interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Quitting Your Job

Quitting your job means leaving on your own terms, embodying the concept of acting as a "free agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Advantages of Quitting

*   **On Your Own Terms**: You proactively recognize your career trajectory and make a move to better yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This is especially beneficial for those in a company for a long time, as it can lead to bigger pay increases by testing the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Preparedness**: You likely have a job lined up, ensuring you are fully prepared for the transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Rehire Eligibility**: If done correctly, you may be eligible for rehire, which can serve as a valuable safety net if your new employment doesn't work out or if the economy sours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Easier [[job_searching_while_employed | Job Searching While Employed]]**: It is generally easier to get another job when you already have one, as there's less pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Interview Confidence**: Being employed during an interview reduces stress, allowing you to relax and sell yourself more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Negotiating Power**: You typically have more negotiating power because you don't "really need" the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Control over Narrative**: You have the initiative to explain your departure positively during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Quitting

*   **Burned Bridges**: If you don't quit properly or burn bridges, you may not be eligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**: The "grass isn't always greener" â€“ your new employer might be similar to the old one, or market conditions could change, leaving your previous job filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **No Severance or Unemployment**: You will not receive a severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, and you are unlikely to collect unemployment benefits, unless it was due to a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Getting Fired

Being fired means the employer unilaterally ends your employment, typically due to issues like performance or misconduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Advantages of Getting Fired

*   **Potential Unemployment**: This is the main, and possibly only, advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If fired for poor performance (e.g., not good at the job, written up, PIP), you will generally be able to collect unemployment, as employers have difficulty defending against such claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   **Caveat**: If fired for gross negligence (e.g., causing a fight, stealing), unemployment will likely be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Getting Fired

*   **Stigma**: There's a significant stigma associated with being terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Difficult Interviews**: You will face challenging conversations in interviews, needing to explain poor performance or more sensitive issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Not on Your Terms**: You are at the mercy of the employer, with little to no warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) might offer some time to initiate a [[job_search_tips_and_resources_after_quitting_a_job | job search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, gross negligence can lead to immediate termination, thrusting you into unemployment unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **No Rehire/References**: You are probably not eligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, and it will be difficult to get positive references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Employers typically do not disclose termination during employment verification, but they may check references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Being Laid Off

A layoff occurs when an employer eliminates your job altogether, often due to restructuring or economic reasons, not necessarily performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Advantages of Being Laid Off

*   **Guaranteed Unemployment**: You almost always qualify for unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Severance Package**: Often, you'll receive a company severance package, which can include a lump sum of money, continuation of benefits, and access to outplacement services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Rehire Eligibility**: You might be eligible for rehire depending on your work performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Being Laid Off

*   **Not on Your Own Terms**: Layoffs are rarely anticipated; many are caught completely off guard by an email or meeting notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This can be devastating, especially for good performers who are unprepared to weather the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Stiff Competition**: Mass layoff events mean many people enter the labor market simultaneously, leading to abnormally stiff competition for the same jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of having a standout resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Stigma/Bias**: Despite not being performance-related, there can still be a stigma, with some employers biased towards laid-off individuals, perceiving them as "damaged goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Specific Scenarios and Interview Strategies

### Poor Performance Track Record

If you have a history of poor performance and are facing documentation or a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), it might be better to get terminated for performance-related issues rather than quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: You can collect unemployment and maintain some continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **No Advantage to Quitting**: In this case, quitting offers no real benefit; you won't get a positive reference or be eligible for rehire anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Softening Market or Impending Layoff

If you know your industry or the broader market is softening and your company hasn't announced layoffs, consider waiting before quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: You might be included in a future layoff and receive a substantial severance package that you would miss if you quit prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Employer's Perspective in Interviews

*   **Terminated for Cause**: This is the most difficult situation to overcome in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. It raises red flags, prompts deeper questioning, and leads employers to scrutinize your resume for potential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Laid Off (Mass Layoff)**: If it was a mass layoff event, you shouldn't be overly worried about justifying it. A simple explanation like "I got caught up in a mass reduction in force" is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. However, be prepared for potential bias from "outdated" interviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Quitting Your Job**: This generally gives you the most strength and is the most preferable scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Employers will want to hear good reasons for your departure, not just that you left due to being upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Focus on demonstrating how you overcame adversity and showcase your reasons for moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

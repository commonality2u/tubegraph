When asked "Why should we hire you?" in an interview, job seekers often make [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_an_interview | mistakes]] by providing generic responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. These "fluffy" answers fail to provide the interviewer with specific information about the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Generic Responses to Avoid

Interviewers frequently receive responses that are too vague and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Avoid statements such as:

*   "I'm a team player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
    *   *Note*: This phrase is also noted as physically impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   "I'm a fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   "I achieve results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'm going to jump into your team and hit the ground running" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

These types of generic answers are ineffective because most candidates will say or believe they can do these things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Instead, successful answers should link past business results to the company's specific business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

When navigating the job interview process, one common pitfall job seekers encounter is revealing their previous salary to potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This question typically arises during the recruiter phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Reasons to Avoid Disclosing Previous Salary

### Locking Yourself Into a Lower Offer
If you disclose your previous salary, you risk "locking yourself into that" figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. While it might be advantageous if your previous salary was high and reflected your true value, in most cases, this disclosure can lead to a lower salary offer than you might otherwise deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is particularly true if you were previously underpaid compared to the market rate for your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### The Candidate Determines Their Worth
A key principle in [[Salary transparency and discussions|salary discussions]] is that the employer should not determine your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Instead, as the employee, you should determine your worth based on what the open market suggests for your specific skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. [[The importance of marketawareness in salary negotiation|Market awareness]] is crucial here.

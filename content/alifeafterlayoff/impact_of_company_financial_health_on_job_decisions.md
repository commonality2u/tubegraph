The financial health of a company significantly impacts employee workload, compensation, and job security, often serving as a key indicator for employees considering a job change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience notes that many job seekers leave their positions for a variety of reasons, including issues related to their employer's financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Signs of Financial Instability Affecting Employees

Several signs indicate a company might be facing financial challenges, which can directly influence an employee's decision to seek new opportunities:

### Overloaded Workloads
The "Great Resignation" period has led to many people leaving the workforce, and companies have struggled to replace that talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Additionally, some companies have cut back on expenses due to rising inflation and difficulty containing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. When an employee quits, the company may not quickly backfill the position, or they might be unable to find new hires willing to work for the wages offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This often results in remaining employees getting stuck with the extra work, transforming what was once a job for two people into a single person's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Such scenarios can lead to working 70 to 90 hours a week, causing burnout and pushing employees to update their resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. When evaluating a new role, it's crucial to [[evaluating_the_company_and_role_as_a_candidate | ask the right questions]] in the interview to avoid jumping into a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Underpayment and Lack of Raises
If an employee is underpaid or believes they are, especially after market research shows others in similar roles are receiving significantly higher salaries, it's a clear sign to consider leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Companies struggling financially may find it difficult to offer competitive salaries or reasonable increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If current pay lags the market, incremental raises (typically 2-3% merit or cost-of-living increases) will not allow an employee to catch up, especially with high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. In some job types, like tech recruiting, salaries have seen explosive growth (30-40% increases) due to competitive markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This highlights that if a company is in financial trouble, it may be unable to keep pace with market rates, making it a compelling reason for employees to seek out new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Increased Layoffs
An uptick in company layoffs, even in a strong market, is a significant indicator of a company's financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Employees should pay close attention to these indicators and assess the financial strength of their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Waiting for "the other shoe to drop" can leave an employee vulnerable, making it advisable to update their resume and explore other options proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Employer Responsibility
Good companies recognize the need to invest in their employees and cannot afford to burn them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In a competitive labor market, companies must look at their total compensation packages, work-life balance, and overall competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Recognizing the Need to Act
If multiple co-workers are quitting, it often indicates a compelling reason for their departure, and current employees should consider networking with them to explore opportunities on their new teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Life is too short, and the job market is strong, making it an ideal time to leave a less-than-ideal situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Recent news indicates that economic slowdowns and layoffs are increasing, partly due to the growing influence of artificial intelligence in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This trend is affecting both job security for those currently employed and job prospects for those seeking work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_advancements_in_job_displacement | AI and Job Displacement]]

Major corporations are implementing layoffs as a direct result of [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_advancements_in_job_displacement | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. An increasing number of companies are replacing human workers with [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_advancements_in_job_displacement | artificial intelligence tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Specific instances where [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_advancements_in_job_displacement | AI's role in layoffs]] is suggested:
*   **Meta Platforms**: Some of Meta's numerous layoffs, totaling 21,000 workers since 2021, are likely [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_advancements_in_job_displacement | AI-related]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Workday**: The company Workday, which provides human resources software, has cut 8% of its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This is seen as a sign of [[role_of_ai_in_hiring_processes | artificial intelligence]] becoming more prevalent in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. These job cuts indicate a trend where [[impact_of_ai_on_jobs | AI is impacting people losing their jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## [[role_of_ai_in_hiring_processes | AI's Role in Hiring]]

While [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_advancements_in_job_displacement | AI contributes to job losses]], it is also expected to help companies hire "more efficiently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. An [[role_of_ai_in_hiring_processes | artificial intelligence robot]] can quickly review job profiles and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. However, this process is "very black and white," meaning candidates either fit the exact profile or they do not, potentially limiting opportunities for those who don't perfectly match predefined criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The overall impact of [[ai_in_the_tech_industry | artificial intelligence]] on employment is significant. This shift, combined with broader [[impact_of_economic_changes_on_job_availability | economic factors]] and tariffs, is expected to create a challenging job market with widespread layoffs in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Economists are forecasting an additional 1.5 to 2 million private sector layoffs by April of next year, contributing to a total of 1.7 to 2.2 million layoffs when combined with federal cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Job security is considered shakier than it has been in years, emphasizing the need for individuals to have a strategic game plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. It is advised that individuals assess their skills for future market needs, fill skill gaps, build professional networks, and consider establishing side income streams to prepare for potential income disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Being careful about what is said to co-workers in the workplace is crucial to avoid trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A former HR person shares common issues that arise from oversharing with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. While co-workers may not always be true friends, it's important to be extremely cautious about what is disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Do Not Disclose an Active Job Search

Telling co-workers about an active job search can quickly lead to widespread whispers throughout the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This information inevitably reaches bosses, senior leaders, and the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
Additionally, when looking for a new job, be careful where resumes are placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Uploading a resume with current company information to databases like Indeed or LinkedIn, especially when marked as "available to work," can lead to your current employer finding out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This can expedite one's exit from the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Avoid Negative Talk and Gossip

*   **About Your Boss**: Do not say anything negative about your boss, even if you feel that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even if you think you have a trusted confidant, engaging in such conversations can come back to negatively impact you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **About Other Co-workers**: Refrain from [[the_dangers_of_workplace_gossip | gossiping]] about other co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Having a reputation as a gossip is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. If others find out you're talking about them behind their back, they are likely to file a complaint with management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. No matter how close a confidant is, the boss often finds out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Do Not Share Your Salary

While salary transparency is generally positive for a level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, sharing salary information within your current company is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. When salaries are shared, it's common for someone to realize they are underpaid and become upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This can lead to employees quitting or confronting management, which can cause the boss to lose trust in those involved, potentially hindering promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
For salary transparency, anonymous platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind are better alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Avoid Financial Interactions

Borrowing money from co-workers is strongly advised against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Similar to mixing money with family or friends, it tends to make situations "sticky" and often ends poorly for the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Asking for money can also create uncomfortable situations for colleagues, potentially leading them to report it to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Be Careful with Comments on Personal Appearance or Status

*   **Complimenting Physical Attributes**: Avoid complimenting co-workers on their physical attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Even if the intention is innocent, it's how the compliment is perceived by the recipient that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Many complaints to HR stem from co-workers feeling uncomfortable due to such comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Keep comments professional; for example, a new haircut can be complimented, but avoid being "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Speculating About Pregnancy**: Do not assume or call out if you think someone is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The two main outcomes are either they are not ready to disclose it, or they are not pregnant at all, both of which can offend the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Let individuals take the lead on disclosing such personal news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Do Not Discuss Employee Relations Issues or Lawsuits

If involved in a major employee relations issue or considering a lawsuit against the company, do not discuss it with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Sharing details about your case or the company's alleged wrongdoings can lead to others taking notes, which could be used to defend the company, or the company taking proactive measures against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Keep such matters private and discuss them only with an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Avoid Off-Color Jokes

Telling off-color jokes to co-workers is a frequent cause of complaints in HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Jokes perceived as innocent by the teller can be offensive to the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The intention behind the joke doesn't matter as much as how it is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It is best to stick to "dumb dad jokes" or avoid jokes altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Steer Clear of Political Discussions

In today's workplace, it is increasingly difficult but important to avoid political discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. No matter one's political leanings, political topics can be hot buttons that inevitably upset someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Such discussions are likely to end in arguments without convincing the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

To safeguard one's career and avoid legal trouble, it is best to take the high road and treat co-workers with a high degree of [[handling_workplace_professionalism | professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. While being friendly is acceptable, extreme caution should be exercised regarding what is said and disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

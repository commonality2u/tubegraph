The labor market has experienced a definitive softening in the past six to eight months, with a widespread trend of companies, especially in the tech industry, conducting layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This trend is expected to continue spilling over into other industries throughout 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. It appears that companies have not learned lessons from 2020 regarding how to treat people with dignity and respect, or how to handle the entire employment and layoff process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Economic Whiplash and Unprofessional Conduct

The current situation follows a period of "crazy economic boom" where people were hired rapidly with significant wage increases, particularly in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This boom was not sustainable, and "the bottom fell out" as quickly as it started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Companies are now frequently seen handling layoffs in unprofessional ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## Disturbing Examples of Layoff Practices

Several examples highlight the egregious nature of recent [[experiences_of_layoffs_and_company_handling | company handling]] of layoffs:
*   The Better.com layoffs were widely covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   A Google employee, who had worked there for over 10 years, was forced to return to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. He discovered his layoff when his badge no longer worked to enter the building, with no prior email or call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This showed disrespect, forcing a long commute and gas money spent only to find out they no longer had a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   Stories exist of individuals notified of their layoff while in the middle of business trips, away from home, causing embarrassment and logistical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   A person was laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   An individual left a previous company to join Google for only 13 weeks before being laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This situation disrupted their life and [[impact_of_layoffs_on_career_momentum | derailed their career momentum]] without accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Corporate Accountability and Employee Perspective

The [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | impact of layoffs on employees]] is significant, yet there is a perceived lack of accountability from companies for how these actions disrupt people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Some people express a lack of sympathy for those laid off from high-paying tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. However, it's argued that these individuals are in the same potential situation as others, and it is not wrong for anyone to pursue the highest possible earnings in their profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. While the rapid hiring and subsequent mass layoffs might be predictable given market trends, it "doesn't excuse these companies from hiring recklessly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

Companies often view employees as mere "human resources" or "a number on a spreadsheet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. They eliminate positions without hesitation once an employee is no longer deemed "useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. This perspective ignores that employees are individuals with lives, families, financial obligations, and aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

### The Zillow Example

Zillow, for instance, laid off a significant portion of its recruiting staff in late 2022, only to post the exact same jobs a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This raises questions about why they didn't rehire the recently laid-off employees or why they failed to forecast their staffing needs appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This example underscores the lack of accountability in destroying someone's life only to re-post their position shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## The Death of Corporate Loyalty

The current environment demonstrates that "corporate loyalty is dead," having largely disappeared with the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The days of working for decades at a single company and collecting a pension are largely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. The modern workforce operates on a "what have you done for me lately" mentality, driven by "instant gratification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. When difficulties arise, layoffs quickly follow, only for companies to rush to rehire later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. This cycle leads to instability for employees who may leave seemingly stable opportunities only to face another layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

## The Need for Selfishness in Career Management

Given these [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | workplace culture]] shifts, individuals are advised to adopt a "selfish" approach to their careers, acting as a "free agent" or the "CEO of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. This means always prioritizing one's own best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

> "There is absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish in your career because nobody else is going to look out for you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>

An anecdotal story illustrates this point: an individual laid off in early November unexpectedly secured multiple job offers by mid-December, including one offering a $50,000 raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Even after accepting an offer and starting a new job in January, they continued interviewing and received an even stronger offer, nearly $100,000 more than their original salary before being laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Despite having just started a new role, they were encouraged to consider the better opportunity because employees must always be thinking for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. One cannot assume stability, as the risk of being laid off after a short tenure (like the 13-week Google example) always exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

Ultimately, employees owe their employer nothing more than "an honest day's work for an honest day's pay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>, as companies primarily view them as disposable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

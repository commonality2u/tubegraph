Navigating a job interview can be challenging, feeling "a bit like navigating a Minefield" where "one wrong step can end you up in the no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. To ensure a successful outcome, it's crucial to understand what information should *not* be revealed to a recruiter or hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Many [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | common interview mistakes]] involve oversharing, which can lead to negative perceptions or unintended biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## Why Oversharing is Detrimental

Oversharing in an interview can stem from nervousness or being long-winded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Neither trait creates a good impression on the interview team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Employers often "link your ability to articulate yourself to how you would perform in a business setting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Concise answers, typically two to three minutes in length, demonstrate clear and effective communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Furthermore, revealing too much personal information can create bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. While sharing a common interest *could* act as an icebreaker, there's a higher risk that the interviewer may not appreciate what you share, potentially leading to judgment or disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. It's generally best to "avoid sharing anything that's particularly personal" and keep discussions "strictly related to the job at hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Specific Information to Avoid Revealing

### 1. Too Many Personal Facts
Beyond general professional context, avoid delving into personal details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Employers evaluate your ability to articulate professional thoughts clearly, not your personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### 2. The Real Reason for Leaving Your Current Employer
While honesty is valued, it's advised not to share the "entire truth" if your departure reasons are negative, such as disliking a boss, feeling bored, or being treated poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. For example, stating your boss was "terrible" might lead an employer to perceive you as "difficult to work with" and a "red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Similarly, admitting boredom might suggest you lack initiative to find more engaging work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Focus on articulating your reasons in a way that doesn't "come across as threatening to an employer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### 3. Unrelated Future Career Plans
When asked about future career plans (e.g., "Where do you see yourself in five years?"), interviewers seek commitment to the career path and potential for growth within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Stating plans to "start a business" or "switch careers" to something completely different can be a "deal breaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This suggests a lack of passion for the job you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, which employers want to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### 4. Desperation for a Job
Even if you are in urgent need of employment, avoid conveying desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. An employer will perceive this as a negative, similar to the dating world where "somebody has a high sense of urgency for a particular outcome they usually end up pushing that outcome further away from them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Maintain a calm and collected demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### 5. Your Age or Years Left in the Workforce
Avoid revealing your age, either directly or indirectly through elements on your resume (like a fax number or outdated email addresses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Age discrimination, affecting both younger and older candidates, unfortunately occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Similarly, do not state how many years you have left until retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. Revealing you only plan to work for a few more years can create a bias against you, as hiring managers often seek candidates with 10+ year potential for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

### 6. Major Medical Issues or Disabilities (Unless Directly Affecting Job Requirements)
While an employer must ask if you can meet the basic requirements of the position during the application process, and you should answer truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>, avoid proactively disclosing major medical issues or disabilities during the interview itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Laws protect against discrimination based on pregnancy or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. If a reasonable accommodation is required, it's best to indicate this during the application process or at the time of an offer, not during the interview, to prevent inadvertent bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. Candidates are hired for their ability to perform the job as per the description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

### 7. Your Political Belief System
It's tempting to share political views, especially if you believe they align with the company's mission or interviewer's viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. However, "the political spectrum is very wide," "very heated [and] very opinionated," making it "better just to stay completely out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. You can never truly know the interviewer's beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

### 8. Your Previous Salary
[[revealing_salary_history_in_interviews | Disclosing your previous salary]] during a recruiter phone screen or interview can "lock yourself into that" amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. While it might be advantageous if you were well-paid, "in most cases, you're probably going to walk yourself into a lower salary than you probably should," particularly if you were underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. "You as the employee need to be determining your worth" based on the market value for your skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

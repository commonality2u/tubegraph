It is crucial to look for a new job at least once every two years, even if you are satisfied in your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This practice helps prevent complacency and ensures you remain competitive in terms of career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. To effectively manage your career, much like a CEO or a free agent, it's essential to stay informed about [[state_of_the_current_job_market | market dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Preventing Complacency and Wage Stagnation

Staying in a job for too long often results in the market passing individuals by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This means both career opportunities and compensation can fall behind external market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Anecdotal Example: A Top Performer's Raise
A medical field professional, who was a top performer and promoted multiple times over seven to eight years with the same employer, experienced a significant pay increase after seeking external offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Despite being happy in her role, the broader department had nearly 100% turnover in 18 months due to high demand for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. After receiving an external offer that was $5 more per hour, she informed her current employer of her intent to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Her current employer then offered a $15 per hour raise, citing a desire to retain staff due to high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

This situation raises questions about why employers wait until employees are leaving to offer proper compensation and whether they were significantly underpaying staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In a tight labor market, companies may exploit situations where employees do not complain about pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The employee accepted the counteroffer, preferring the comfort of the known workplace, despite the challenges of onboarding at a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Pay Philosophy and Market Lag
Companies have different pay philosophies:
*   **Pay Leaders**: Aim to retain talent by paying competitively and can poach talent from other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggards**: Tolerate high turnover as part of their model, often resulting in increased recruiting and training costs, and loss of institutional knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

External hires often receive 10-20% raises when jumping jobs, as companies must pay more to stay competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. In contrast, internal employees might only receive small promotional bumps (5-10%) every few years or annual cost-of-living adjustments (1-3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This means a new hire with less experience could earn the same or more than someone who has been with the company for five or more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

If salary growth is only tied to small incremental adjustments, especially with inflation, employees are effectively making less money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This leads to significant wage stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Recruiters often observe departments where employees are 20-30% below [[state_of_the_current_job_market | market rate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. If an employee has been in the same job or role for more than two to three years without significant promotions or raises, the market has likely passed them by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Benefits of Regularly Testing the Market

Regularly testing the open market, at a minimum every two years, is an important strategy for every professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Even if satisfied with your current employer, this practice helps:
*   **Stay Informed**: Keep tabs on what is happening in your industry's [[state_of_the_current_job_market | market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Assess Skills**: Understand what skills are in demand and how you are assessed in interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Compensation**: Determine if you are underpaid relative to the market by reaching the offer stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Leverage**: Use offers carefully to ensure you are being paid appropriately in your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

By proactively engaging with the market, you can avoid falling so far behind that it becomes impossible to catch up without a major company-wide salary adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## How to Test the Market

To test the market effectively:
*   **Submit Applications**: Put out some applications for jobs that align with [[state_of_the_current_job_market | industry leaders]] or "Alpha employers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **[[importance_of_networking_in_job_searching | Network]]**: Connect with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Many great opportunities come through active and targeted [[importance_of_networking_in_job_searching | networking]], rather than just applying for jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Market Volatility

In [[state_of_the_current_job_market | today's economy]], the [[state_of_the_current_job_market | market]] is constantly changing, often with rapid swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Therefore, staying on top of market trends and your value is more critical than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

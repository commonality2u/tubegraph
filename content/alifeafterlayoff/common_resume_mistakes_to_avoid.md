When writing a resume, it's crucial to know what to include and what to leave off to stand out in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A resume serves as the first impression made on recruiters and hiring teams, so it needs to be clean, concise, and well-crafted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Recruiters frequently observe [[common_mistakes_in_resume_writing | consistent errors]] on resumes that can be easily avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Graphics and Colors

Avoid including bright graphics or colors in your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While some color for a job title is acceptable (e.g., blues, blacks, or possibly magenta), the goal is to keep the resume clean and concise to avoid distracting the interviewer from assessing your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Graphs, Charts, and Clip Art
Your resume is a professional document, and including too many colorful elements like graphs, charts, or clip art can lead to negative judgments, even if you think they show personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The only exception is if you are in a creative field, such as an art director or graphic designer, where demonstrating creativity is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For most other career types, keep it simple and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Infographics for Skill Proficiency
Using infographics to demonstrate skill proficiency, such as progress bars, can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. If an infographic indicates you are only 3 out of 10 on a skill, it signals to recruiters and hiring managers that you are weak in an area that might be important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It's better to let employers assess your skills during the [[common_job_interview_mistakes | interview process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. While aiming to be vague in this regard, never lie or misrepresent skills you don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Formatting Issues

### Columns
Avoid using multiple columns on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) typically parse text from left to right, and while many are sophisticated, they can struggle with columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. An ATS might only read the first column, making other listed skills invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This can prevent you from being discovered if a recruiter searches for keywords in the ATS later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Always aim to be as discoverable as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Personal Information

### Photographs
In the U.S. and North America, avoid including photographs of yourself on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Recruiters often assume a resume with a photo is not from the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The primary reason is to prevent potential judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. However, if you are applying in a country where photographs are customary, follow local traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Personal Identifiers
Do not include personal identifiers such as gender, race, creed, color, or marital status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For instance, stating you are "married with two kids" can be used against you by unscrupulous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Omit anything that pertains to a protected class to avoid discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This tip is primarily U.S. specific; if your country's customs differ, follow them, but generally, avoid more detail than necessary regarding non-work-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Unprofessional Email Addresses
Steer clear of unprofessional email addresses like "iusuallyparty@yahoo.com" or "partyboy28@yahoo.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Create a professional Gmail account using your full name or a neutral moniker to avoid giving hiring managers any reason to judge or make assumptions about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Full Addresses
Full street addresses are no longer needed on a resume; only your city and state are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Employers don't need to know your exact residence or send you mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Providing a full address can lead to discrimination based on commute distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For remote work, recruiters still need to know your city and state for time zone considerations and taxation issues, especially if applying from another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Content and Experience

### Irrelevant or Old Work History
Avoid including work history that is not relevant or is over 10 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Employers generally focus on your last 10 years of experience, and more recently, the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Skills from jobs older than 10 years are often no longer relevant due to market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Unless a job specifically requires 20 years of experience (rare, except for senior executive roles), a long, elaborate work history is unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Industry-Specific Jargon and Acronyms
Do not include industry-specific jargon, job titles unique to your company, or acronyms that would not be understood outside your organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Such specific language is not helpful for discoverability and forces hiring managers to work harder to understand your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Excessive Education Detail
Limit the detail about your degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. You don't need to specify the exact college or school within a university (e.g., "Penn State's business school" can just be "Penn State") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Employers don't heavily weight minor degrees, so don't waste resume space detailing all minor courses, unless you are entry-level and need those keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Grade Point Average (GPA)
If you are more than three years out of college, remove your GPA from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Employers generally do not care about it or ask about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. If you are entry-level or have less than three years of total work experience, keep your GPA, but plan to remove it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Internships (After 3 Years)
If you've been in the workforce for longer than three years, remove internships from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. They are not typically counted as total years of experience and become "vanity stats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### References
Do not list actual references or state "references available upon request" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Recruiters will ask for references if needed, and checking them is becoming less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Salary History or Expectations
Never include previous salary history or expected compensation on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Disclosing this information can lock you into a lower salary and open you up to lowball offers if the employer has a healthier range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Salary discussions will occur during the first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Skills and Language

### Universal or Generic Skills
Avoid wasting valuable resume space on universal or generic skills like Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. These are industry standard and assumed for most professional jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Similarly, do not list "leadership" or "organization skills"; instead, demonstrate these competencies through bullet points in your experience section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Cliche Jargon
Eliminate generic, fluffy, or cliche jargon like "I'm a team player" or "I'm a fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Such phrases add no value to your resume, as no one would admit to not possessing these qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Save your resume real estate for more substantive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

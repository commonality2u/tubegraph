From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

A resume serves as the crucial first impression on recruiters and hiring teams, particularly in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. To stand out from the crowd, it's essential to have a clean, concise, and well-crafted resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. As a corporate recruiter, certain [[common_mistakes_in_resume_design_and_content | common mistakes]] are frequently observed on resumes that can be easily avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Design and Visual Elements

*   **Bright Graphics or Colors**
    Avoid using bright graphics or excessive colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While some color for a job title is acceptable (e.g., as taught in "Resume Rocket Fuel"), stick to blues, blacks, or possibly magenta to keep it simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The goal is to keep the resume clean and concise, without distracting the interviewer from assessing your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Graphs, Charts, or Clip Art**
    Your resume is a professional document, and including graphs, charts, or clip art can lead to judgment, even if you think it's "cute" or shows personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   **Exception**: If you are in a creative field, such as an art director or graphic designer, these elements might be expected to demonstrate your creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For most other careers, keep it simple and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Infographics for Skill Proficiency**
    Do not use "cute infographics" (e.g., skill bars) to demonstrate proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Indicating a low proficiency level (e.g., 3 out of 10) can make you appear weak in a potentially important skill and might eliminate you from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It's better to allow skill assessment during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, never lie or misrepresent skills you don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Columns**
    Avoid using multiple columns in your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) typically parse left to right, and while many are sophisticated, they can struggle with columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This can lead to some skills being invisible to the system, making you undiscoverable in searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Personal Information

*   **Photographs**
    In the U.S. and North America, avoid including a photograph of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Recruiters often assume a resume with a photo is not from the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. If you are applying from a country where photos are customary, follow local tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Personal Identifiers**
    Do not include personal identifiers such as gender, race, creed, color, or marital status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This includes details like being "married with two kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The goal is to eliminate any non-work-related decisions being made about you and prevent unscrupulous employers from discriminating against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This advice is primarily U.S. specific; if your country's traditions differ, follow those, but generally avoid unnecessary personal details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Unprofessional Email Addresses**
    Ensure your email address is professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. If you have an old, "colorful" email from college (e.g., "partyboy28@yahoo.com"), create a new, neutral Gmail account with your full name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Avoid nicknames or anything that could lead to judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Full Addresses**
    Full street addresses are no longer needed on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Only the city and state are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Providing a full address can lead to discrimination based on commute distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For remote work, city and state are still important for time zones and company taxation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Work History and Education

*   **Irrelevant or Old Work History**
    Avoid including work history that is not relevant or is older than 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Employers generally focus on the last 10 years, and often more recently (last five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Older skills may no longer be relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, unless the job specifically requires extensive experience (e.g., 20+ years for a senior executive role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Industry-Specific Jargon or Acronyms**
    Do not use industry-specific jargon, job titles, or acronyms that are not universally understood outside of your company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This can hinder discoverability and make it harder for hiring managers to understand your experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Excessive Education Details**
    Provide too much detail about your degrees or courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Simply list the university and degree type; you don't need to specify the exact school within a university (e.g., "Penn State," not "Schmiel Business School") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Minor degrees are good keywords but don't require extensive detail about courses studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Grade Point Average (GPA)**
    If you are more than three years out of college, do not include your GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Employers generally don't care about it at this stage of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. If you're entry-level or have less than three years of experience, keep it, but plan to remove it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Internships (After 3+ Years)**
    If you've been in the workforce for more than three years, remove internships from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. They are not typically counted as total years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Other Unnecessary Information

*   **References or "References Available Upon Request"**
    Do not list actual references or state "references available upon request" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Recruiters will ask for references if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, and many employers are moving away from routinely checking references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Salary History or Expected Compensation**
    Never include previous salary history or expected compensation on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Disclosing this information can lock you into a lower salary or open you up to a lowball offer, even if the employer has a healthier pay range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This will be discussed in the first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Skills and Generic Phrases

*   **Universal or Generic Skills**
    Avoid listing universal or generic skills like Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. These are generally assumed for professional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Instead, allow the recruiter to ask about these if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Leadership and organization skills should be demonstrated through bullet points in your experience section, rather than listed as standalone skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Generic or Cliche Jargon**
    Do not use generic or cliche jargon such as "team player" or "fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. These phrases add no value as nobody would admit to not being a team player or quick learner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Save resume space for more impactful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

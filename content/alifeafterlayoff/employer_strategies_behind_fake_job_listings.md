The job market currently presents conflicting data, with claims of a robust market and record job openings alongside numerous major corporate layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Amidst this, the "employment pendulum" has swung back to the employer, leading to phenomena like "ghost job postings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## What Are Ghost Job Postings?
A ghost posting is defined as a job listed by an employer with no real intention of ever filling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These are a type of [[fake_job_postings_and_hiring_practices | fake job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Pipelining Wrecks
A specific type of ghost posting is a "pipelining wreck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is a job posting made by an employer solely to collect resumes for a future date, without any immediate intent to fill the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The goal is to build a talent pool to have a head start when they eventually decide to recruit again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The optics around these [[role_of_deceptive_job_postings_like_pipelining_wrecks | pipelining wrecks]] are considered "shady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It's viewed as a very poor candidate experience, especially in a market with many laid-off individuals, as job seekers spend significant time on applications only for employers to have no intention of hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Misleading Job Opening Numbers
The speaker suggests that the reported "record number of job openings" is misleading, as many are likely:
*   Contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   Part-time roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   Seasonal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
*   Positions without benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Not what would generally be considered career-type jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

## Survey Insights on Ghost Jobs
A survey by Clarify Capital involved 1,045 managers in the hiring process, conducted between August 31st and September 1st, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Key findings:
*   **68%** of managers had job postings active for over 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **1 in 10** hiring managers had a job posting open for over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **1 in 5** managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **50%** of managers kept job postings open because they were "always open to new people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The fact that employers plan to fill active jobs several months in the future is "head scratching" and could be a symptom of employers being ambiguous with their hiring plans, possibly tied to layoffs and uncertainty about headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs
The most common reasons why employers aren't actively trying to fill a position:

*   **Company is always open to new people (50%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>: They want to keep "recs" (requisitions) open to see who applies, akin to window shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>: The speaker questions how this would genuinely motivate employees, suggesting it might be a deceptive tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>: This is considered "deceitful" to both job candidates and investors and potentially illegal from an SEC perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **The job was filled** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>: This indicates a lazy recruiter or HR person, as the job requisition should be pulled down once filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates/applicants in case of turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>: This is similar to the "always open to new people" reason, emphasizing the employer's desire to be prepared for future staffing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>: This is seen as "lazy recruiting" and "irresponsible," hoping a perfect candidate appears without active effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **To placate overworked employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>: This is described as "sinister," involving tricking current, overwhelmed employees into thinking help is coming when it isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Forgot to delete the job** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>: Another instance of recruiter or HR negligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **No reason in particular / they simply don't care** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## How to Identify and Avoid Ghost Jobs
Job seekers can use several [[strategies_to_identify_and_avoid_fake_job_postings | strategies to identify and avoid fake job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> and [[identifying_low_quality_job_postings | low quality job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>:

*   **Check the posting date:** If a job has been up for more than six months, it's likely a ghost wreck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Monitor reposting frequency:** If a job is posted repeatedly over a long period, it's also a strong indicator of a ghost wreck or an employer with poor retention/decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Conduct reverse reference checks:** Investigate if the company recently had major layoffs, especially in the same positions they are now advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If so, they might be trying to build a future pipeline, but demonstrate a lack of loyalty to that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Analyze the job description detail:** A detailed job description with specifics about accomplishments, responsibilities, and reporting structure suggests a more serious and active requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Generic, salesy descriptions are a "pretty big red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Consider the recency of the post:** Jobs posted within the last week are more likely to be legitimate and actively recruited upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

By applying these [[effective_job_search_strategies | effective job search strategies]], job seekers can avoid falling victim to [[employment_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them | employment scams]] and focus on high-quality roles with legitimate employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Customizing a resume is considered the single most impactful action a job seeker can take to increase their chances of receiving a callback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. While an experiment involving applying to a thousand jobs with minimal customization showed a good response rate in a labor market desperate for candidates, it is generally advised that job seekers prioritize [[optimizing_and_customizing_resumes_for_job_applications | optimizing and customizing their resumes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## Why Customization Matters
Lack of resume customization can lead to very limited results in a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Each resume submitted should ideally be tailored to the specific role or industry vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Tailoring for Specific Roles
It is recommended to have multiple versions of a resume, especially if a job seeker has experience in diverse career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Instead of presenting oneself as a "jack of all trades," it is more effective to niche down and be specific about the types of resumes submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This specific approach tends to yield much better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

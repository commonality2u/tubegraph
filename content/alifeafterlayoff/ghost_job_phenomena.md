The phenomenon of "ghost postings" or [[fake_job_postings | fake job postings]] refers to job listings that employers publish without any real intention of filling the position [00:00:22, 00:01:30]. This practice has seen a rise in the job market, creating confusion for job seekers amidst conflicting data about the labor market [00:00:05, 00:01:26].

## Conflicting Job Market Signals
The current job market presents a confusing picture [00:00:34]. On one hand, the FED claims the job market is robust with a record number of job openings [00:00:37]. On the other hand, major corporations are frequently announcing layoffs [00:00:43]. This disconnect, where there are record job numbers but also widespread layoffs and seemingly unfilled positions, suggests something is not adding up [00:00:48, 00:00:54].

While people are still landing jobs, indicating the market isn't as severe as 2020, the employment pendulum has largely swung back to the employer [00:01:04, 00:01:13]. This shift includes employers engaging in practices like forcing employees back into the office and an increase in [[fake_job_postings | ghost job postings]] [00:01:17, 00:01:26].

### Misleading Job Opening Statistics
The speaker believes that the reported total number of job openings is misleading [00:03:24]. Many of these "record" job listings are often:
*   Contract positions [00:03:35]
*   Part-time roles [00:03:37]
*   Seasonal work [00:03:39]
*   Positions that do not offer benefits [00:03:41]

These types of roles are generally not considered "career type jobs" [00:03:42]. This discrepancy is frustrating for job seekers who are told the market is robust but struggle to find suitable career opportunities [00:03:48, 00:04:01].

## Pipelining Requisitions (Wrecks)
A common form of [[fake_job_postings | ghost job posting]] is the "pipelining wreck" [00:01:37]. These are job postings designed to collect resumes for a future date, without any immediate intent to fill the position [00:01:43]. The goal is to build a candidate pool to have a head start when actual recruitment begins [00:01:45, 00:01:52].

The speaker has encountered such postings, especially from companies that have recently undergone massive layoffs, which they view as "shady" [00:01:57, 00:02:03].

## Impact on Candidate Experience
The practice of posting [[fake_job_postings | ghost jobs]] leads to a very poor candidate experience [00:02:11]. Job seekers, particularly those who have been laid off, are not interested in being misled [00:02:14, 00:02:18]. They invest significant time and effort into crafting targeted, custom resumes and applications, hoping for a genuine opportunity [00:02:24, 00:02:30]. When an employer has no intention of hiring, this effort is wasted [00:02:20, 00:02:38].

Employers, especially leaders in talent acquisition, often "lose sight of the candidate experience" [00:02:41, 00:02:45]. For job seekers in areas with limited opportunities, seeing a desirable job from a prominent employer can generate significant excitement [00:02:53, 00:03:01]. They anxiously await a response that will never come, leading to frustration and disappointment [00:03:06, 00:03:15].

The speaker urges employers to prioritize candidate experience and eliminate unnecessary pipelining requisitions [00:03:17, 00:03:22].

## Survey Findings on Ghost Jobs
A Clarify Capital survey, conducted between August 31st and September 1st, 2022, polled 1,045 managers involved in hiring about ghost jobs [00:04:22, 00:04:32].
Key findings include:
*   **68%** of managers had job postings active for more than 30 days [00:04:35]. While common for highly skilled positions, this is noteworthy [00:04:40].
*   **1 in 10** hiring managers had a job posting open for over six months, indicating it might be an "aging wreck" due to specific skill sets, picky hiring managers, or a lack of candidates [00:05:00, 00:05:13].
*   **1 in 5** managers did not plan to fill open job postings until 2023 (as of the 2022 survey) [00:05:29, 00:05:39].
*   **50%** of managers keep job postings open because "they're always open to new people" [00:05:42, 00:05:45].

The fact that employers are intentionally planning to fill active jobs months in the future is "head scratching," possibly a symptom of ambiguous hiring plans tied to layoffs [00:06:25, 00:06:29]. The speaker suggests that if this is the case, the requisition should be pulled down to stop collecting resumes [00:06:40, 00:06:42].

## Reasons Employers Post Ghost Jobs
The Clarify Capital survey also revealed the most common reasons employers maintain ghost job postings [00:06:50]. These reasons, and the speaker's commentary, include:

*   **Company is always open to new people (50%)**: Employers keep requisitions open to "window shop" for talent, hoping someone exceptional applies without a real intention to hire [00:06:57, 00:07:22]. The speaker finds this disappointing [00:07:29].
*   **To keep current employees motivated**: The speaker questions how fake postings would motivate employees, suggesting it might be a deceptive attempt to reassure overworked staff [00:07:32, 00:07:57]. This is considered "particularly sinister" [00:10:07].
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing**: This practice is seen as deceitful to both job candidates and investors [00:08:02, 00:08:29]. The speaker raises concerns about its legality from an SEC perspective [00:08:07, 00:08:22]. A company that engages in such deception is likely not a desirable place to work [00:08:51].
*   **The job was filled**: If a job is filled, the requisition should be pulled down immediately [00:08:57, 00:09:00]. This is viewed as a recruiter's or HR person's responsibility and a sign of laziness if not done [00:09:01, 00:10:40].
*   **To have an active pool of candidates/applicants in case there is turnover**: This is a direct parallel to the speaker's advice for job seekers to always act like a free agent and keep their resume updated [00:09:19, 00:09:40].
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies**: This is described as "lazy recruiting" and "irresponsible," akin to a fisherman casting a line and ignoring it unless a "big fish" comes along effortlessly [00:09:43, 00:10:03].
*   **To placate overworked employees**: This is considered highly deceptive. Employers falsely tell overworked employees that help is coming (the "cavalry"), while secretly having no intention to hire [00:10:05, 00:10:26]. If employees are told the "cavalry is coming" but it never arrives, they may be a victim of [[gaslighting in recruitment | ghost jobs]] and should consider their next steps [00:10:31, 00:10:37].
*   **Forgot to delete the job**: This is attributed to a "lazy recruiter or lazy HR person" with "no excuse" [00:10:38, 00:10:45].
*   **No reason in particular/simply don't care**: The speaker dismisses this reason due to its lack of specific intent [00:10:47, 00:10:51].

## How to Avoid Falling Victim to Ghost Jobs
Job seekers can identify and avoid [[fake_job_postings | ghost jobs]] by carefully examining job postings and conducting due diligence [00:10:53, 00:10:58].

Key indicators of a ghost job:
*   **Age of the posting**: If a job posting has been active for over six months, it's likely a ghost wreck [00:11:02, 00:11:09].
*   **Repeated postings**: A job that is continuously posted over a long period suggests either a ghost wreck, an indecisive hiring manager, or high turnover, none of which are good signs [00:11:11, 00:11:26]. These indicate a "low quality employer" and a "low quality wreck" [00:11:28].
*   **Recent layoffs**: Research if the company recently had major layoffs, especially if the posted positions are similar to those affected [00:11:35, 00:11:42]. If so, the company may be trying to pipeline candidates for future hiring but has demonstrated a lack of loyalty to those roles [00:11:45, 00:11:56].
*   **Generic job descriptions**: Ghost jobs often have generic, sales-focused descriptions that lack specific details about accomplishments, responsibilities, or who the role supports [00:12:02, 00:12:22]. A detailed job description with specifics is a better indicator of a serious, actively recruiting role [00:12:08, 00:12:17].
*   **Recency of the post**: A job posted within the last week is more likely to be an active recruitment effort [00:12:33, 00:12:35]. The older the post (e.g., six months), the less serious the intent to fill [00:12:39].

By being aware of these signs, job seekers can focus their efforts on high-quality roles from legitimate employers who are truly looking to hire [00:12:51, 00:13:05].

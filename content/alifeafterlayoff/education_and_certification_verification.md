When extending a [[approval_process_for_job_offers | job offer]], employers commonly conduct an [[components_of_employment_background_checks | employment background check]] that includes verifying a candidate's claimed education and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This process ensures the information provided on a [[relevance_of_work_history_and_education_in_resumes | resume]] or [[career_advice_and_job_search_strategies | job application]] is accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## What is Verified?

The education verification process typically checks the following:
*   **High School Attendance/Graduation** Employers may verify your high school education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **College Degrees** Any college or university degrees you claim to have obtained will be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Professional Certifications** Specific certifications, such as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license, will be checked to confirm they are actively held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. If you claim a certification but do not possess the license, it will be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## How Verification is Conducted

Verification of education typically involves the third-party background check company directly contacting the university or institution listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Since universities are accustomed to these requests, this part of the [[components_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] is usually completed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Consequences of Discrepancies

The job application is considered a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If an employer finds a discrepancy or determines that information was falsified, even after employment has begun, it can lead to termination for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. If a discrepancy is found during the [[components_of_employment_background_checks | background check]] phase, the [[approval_process_for_job_offers | job offer]] may be rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is crucial to be honest about your academic and professional accomplishments on your [[relevance_of_work_history_and_education_in_resumes | resume]] and [[career_advice_and_job_search_strategies | job application]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Falsifying information, such as having a friend or relative act as an [[employment_and_job_title_verification | employment verifier]], can lead to serious consequences, including the rescission of a [[approval_process_for_job_offers | job offer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It is always recommended to be forthcoming with your background and ensure you possess the credentials you claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

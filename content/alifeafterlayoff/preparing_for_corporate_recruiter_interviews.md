Understanding what a recruiter means versus what they say can provide a significant advantage in job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This insider information can help job seekers [[improving_job_interview_performance | play their cards right]] and increase their chances of landing a desired position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Types of Recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

It's important to differentiate between two main types of recruiters:
*   **Headhunters (Third-Party Recruiters)**: These are external parties contracted by companies to place positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They are typically paid on contingency, meaning they receive a portion of the placed candidate's first-year salary (usually 15-25%) if a hire is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Headhunters usually have less detailed knowledge of the specific role compared to internal recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Corporate Recruiters (Internal Recruiters)**: These individuals are full-time employees within a company's talent acquisition or HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Their primary job is to find the best possible talent and fit for their hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They often support specific functional groups and build strong relationships with hiring managers, leading to a deep understanding of position requirements and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The insider information discussed primarily applies to the interview with an internal corporate recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## The Corporate Recruiter Interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

The initial interview with a corporate recruiter is typically a screening interview designed to assess baseline competencies for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. [[preparing_for_interviews_effectively | Coming out strong]] and making a good first impression is crucial to moving past this first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Recruiter Cues and What They Really Mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>

Being able to [[understanding_recruiter_language_in_interviews | decode recruiter language]] can give you a significant edge during the interview process.

### "What do you know about the company?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **What they mean:** This is a key first interview question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Not understanding the company or the position is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. [[importance_of_company_research_before_interviews | Your preparedness]] indicates your level of interest and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Recruiters look for candidates who are genuinely interested in the positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Asking about specific skills or experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   **What they mean:** If a recruiter asks if you have a specific skill or experience, it's because these are baseline requirements for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Lacking them typically means you won't move to the next round, as hiring managers need to see these on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While there can be exceptions if you bring other significant assets to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, generally, these are non-negotiable.

### Repeatedly rephrasing a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   **What they mean:** If a recruiter has to rephrase a question or keep bringing you back to it, you're likely missing the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Each question is tailored to assess a specific competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Stop, listen, and recalculate your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It's acceptable to ask for clarification, such as "Can you please give me an idea of what it is that you're looking for?" to provide a better tailored answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Rambling answers without follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   **What they mean:** Long-windedness is often detrimental in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. If you ramble and the recruiter doesn't ask follow-up questions, you're likely moving to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Hiring managers see this as an indicator that you won't be able to effectively communicate and influence senior business leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. [[improving_job_interview_performance | Answer questions directly and concisely]], and let the interviewer probe for more information if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Asking about your compensation expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   **What they mean:** If the recruiter asks about your [[negotiation_strategies_with_recruiters_and_employers | compensation expectation]], it's a good sign that they see you as a fit for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If they *don't* ask, you're almost certainly in the "no" pile, as they've already determined you're not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Stating your salary expectation is higher than their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   **What they mean:** If your expectation is a little higher, they might ask if you'd be open to their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If you are honest about your openness, it might still work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   If you're more than $10,000-$15,000 apart, they might say, "This position is scoped a little lower than you're expecting, and if you don't mind, I'll give you a call when I have a more enriched role." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> This means they cannot afford you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It's often a position you wouldn't want anyway if it's drastically below your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Stand firm in your realistic requirements, armed with good data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### "Do you have any questions for me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   **What they mean:** At this point, the interview is effectively over, and the recruiter has already decided if you'll be sent to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. No amount of selling will change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This question is a formality or a chance for you to gather information needed to make an informed decision about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### The recruiter tries to sell you the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   **What they mean:** If the recruiter tries to get you excited about the role, it means they think you're a potentially great fit and will certainly send you to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. They are already trying to "pre-sell" you for a potential offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### The interview wraps up in 10-15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
*   **What they mean:** You are likely not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Most recruiters know within 5-7 minutes whether a candidate is a decent fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. [[preparing_for_job_interviews | Make your best first impression]] from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### "We've had a lot of interest... and we just started interviewing... we'll be back to you whenever we've completed all of our interviews." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
*   **What they mean:** Chances are you are probably not moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. A particularly good candidate will be "pre-sold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Introducing the hiring manager and putting you on their calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   **What they mean:** This is a strong positive sign that you are moving forward in the interviewing process and things look solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

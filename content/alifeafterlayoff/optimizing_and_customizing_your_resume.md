To speed up your job search, it is essential to [[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | optimize your resume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. A generic resume is insufficient in today's labor market; you must take steps to truly stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## ATS Compliance and Human Review

[[building_an_effective_resume_and_ats_compliance | Optimizing your resume]] involves ensuring it is compliant with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While ATS systems generally don't screen out resumes as much as a human does, it's important to make sure the ATS sees your resume correctly so you can be discovered later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

More importantly, it helps your resume get pulled to the top of the pile when recruiters search for specific criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. For example, a senior position might receive 700 applications in 24 hours, making it impossible to review all of them manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Recruiters then search their ATS for specific criteria, and an optimized resume is more likely to appear in such searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## The Importance of Customization

To speed up your job search, you must [[customizing_your_resume_for_specific_job_applications | customize and optimize your resume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Avoid sending the same generic resume to different jobs, as this generally doesn't yield the best results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Creating Multiple Resumes

If you have different specialties or are a good fit for more than one role, consider having multiple resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Sending a resume that portrays you as a "jack of all trades" can dilute your results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Instead, aim to be a great fit for a particular role, and if you match multiple roles, create a targeted resume for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This increases the likelihood that a hiring manager will take interest in your profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Avoiding Common Resume Mistakes

Panic applying to any job that is "remotely interesting" or for which you are "remotely qualified" dilutes your results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It's unlikely you'll get called for a job where you don't closely match at least 70% of the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Applying to jobs where you lack relevant experience, hoping an employer will infer transferable skills, is often a "shot in the dark" and a poor use of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This can slow down your job search, lead to burnout, and result in more rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Focus your time on jobs for which you are genuinely well-qualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Resume Templates

In general, most generic resume templates are not very good and can actually hinder your job search efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

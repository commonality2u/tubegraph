While it's generally advised not to quit a job before securing another, there are specific circumstances that necessitate immediate departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Brian, a corporate recruiter and HR professional with 20 years of experience, identifies five "deal-breaker" situations where staying is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Many individuals grapple with the decision of whether to remain in a challenging work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## General Considerations for Leaving a Job

Tolerating a disliked job can be both emotionally and physically draining, impacting not only the individual but also loved ones, spouses, family, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A steady job is not a valid reason to endure a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While perseverance through difficult situations is valued by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, it's crucial to differentiate this from remaining in an unhealthy position due to a misplaced sense of obligation to a boss or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers understand the difference between "job hopping" and leaving a genuinely bad situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. You should not feel compelled to stay in a role that does not align with your core values or causes physical or mental harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Five Deal-Breaker Situations

### 1. Suffering Emotionally or Physically

Working in a role that negatively affects your mental and physical health is a definitive sign to leave quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Being overworked, overwhelmed, or simply in over your head can lead to serious health issues, impacting both you and your closest relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In extreme cases, individuals have experienced significant changes in their demeanor, outlook, physical appearance, and even required medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If your job necessitates seeing a doctor due to stress, it's a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Symptoms of job-related stress and overload can include:
*   Loss of appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Sudden weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
*   Loss of sleep or sleepless nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   Loss of interest in previously enjoyed hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Anxiety or anxiousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Waking up at night worrying about work tasks or meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   Anticipating uncomfortable conversations with a boss or conflicts with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>
*   Physical manifestations such as hair loss or hives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   A complete lack of motivation to do your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Dreading showing up to work every Monday morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

If you develop physical or mental ailments due to your job or career choice, your health is paramount, and it's time to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Such a role can negatively affect your time, money, career trajectory, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. If the stress stems from the career itself rather than just the company, consider trying something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### 2. A Terrible Boss

A bad boss is the most common reason people leave their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Even a top performer can feel like a failure under a new boss, leading to self-doubt and negatively impacting their career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Examples of terrible boss behavior include:
*   Cutting earned bonuses without justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   Throwing employees "under the bus" in public settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
*   Lacking emotional intelligence and demonstrating poor leadership traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
*   Reprimanding employees in front of peers or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Giving feedback that crushes an employee's will or makes them want to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
*   Dismissing ideas or demotivating through criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>

If you encounter any of these circumstances, you should consider leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### 3. A Toxic Work Culture

A company with a "win at all costs" mentality often signals a bad or [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This mentality typically originates from the top and contributes to high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. While competitiveness is acceptable, winning at the expense of employees or ethical practices is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Signs of a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work culture]] include:
*   Company core values not being reflected by the leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
*   Negative whispers or gossip among employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Lack of respect in how people or colleagues treat each other in meetings or daily interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Unrealistic or unobtainable goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
*   Lack of recognition for accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>

Toxic colleagues can also contribute to a [[Signs of a toxic workplace | toxic work environment]] by actively trying to make your life miserable, spreading rumors, or speaking negatively about you to your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. If your manager is oblivious to these issues or, worse, aligned with such individuals, it's time to seek employment elsewhere, as you are unlikely to succeed in that environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### 4. The Company is Doing Something Illegal

If your company is breaking the law or asking you to do so, you must leave immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This indicates a complete lack of moral compass within the organization, and you could be held personally liable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This applies to financial impropriety, questionable environmental policies, or violations of human resources laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

If you witness illegal activity:
1.  Report it to your HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
2.  If applicable, report it to your legal department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

If no action is taken, and the behavior persists, it's essential to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. No job is worth risking your professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### 5. Being Asked to Do Something Unsafe

Despite OSHA regulations, some companies skirt safety protocols to expedite work and maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. However, safety is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. If you're asked to perform unsafe tasks or bypass OSHA guidelines, the company demonstrates a lack of commitment to your well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

If you are asked to do something unsafe:
1.  Trust your intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
2.  Voice your concerns to your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
3.  If your boss is unresponsive, escalate the concern to your HR leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

A responsible leader would immediately halt the work and address safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. If the company prioritizes profit over your life or well-being, it's absolutely worth leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. No job is worth risking your life or limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

If you find yourself in any of these five deal-breaker situations, it's crucial to assess if the job is a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Remember, a steady job should not be an excuse to tolerate poor working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. However, distinguish between a true deal-breaker and a challenge that can be overcome with perseverance and creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. If you're merely bored or underutilized, consider taking initiative by volunteering for projects or developing new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Ultimately, you are responsible for your career trajectory and must take the necessary steps to achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

This article explores a collection of absurd and ridiculous job requirements and employer behaviors that highlight the [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | challenges with unrealistic employer demands in job postings]] and the general [[mismatch_between_job_expectations_and_compensation | mismatch between job expectations and compensation]] in the modern job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While presented with a touch of humor, these examples serve as a guide for job seekers to recognize when to value themselves and avoid applying for "garbage" opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Unrealistic Compensation and Experience Demands

Employers frequently post job openings with compensation that is severely misaligned with the required experience and qualifications.

### Case Study: Remote Accounting Role
One example is a remote accounting role offering $1,400 a month, which equates to $8.75 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This position requires:
*   Two years of accounting experience with US-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   A Bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Demonstrated experience, with a preference for property management trust accounting and specific software experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Earning $8.75 an hour after completing a four-year degree and gaining two years of experience is below poverty level and insufficient to pay off student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An entry-level accounting job should realistically pay around $45,000 to $50,000 annually, not $16,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This represents a significant [[mismatch_between_job_expectations_and_compensation | mismatch between job expectations and compensation]] and is considered an "absolutely awful" opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Questionable Employer Policies and Fees

Some employers implement highly unusual and anti-employee policies.

### Case Study: Restaurant Employee Handbook Charges
A restaurant's employee handbook outlines a series of charges against an employee's final pay if they leave the organization within a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. These include:
*   Handbook fee: $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Training manual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   File processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Payroll processing fee (to get paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   W-2 processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Uniform costs (t-shirt): $12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Training costs: $25 a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   Hiring processing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Such practices are "unheard of" and indicate a "super low quality employer" that is clearly anti-employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. They penalize individuals due to high turnover, characteristic of lower-level positions, rather than addressing underlying issues in [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employer-employee relationship dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Absurd Interview Etiquette Expectations

Some employers have bizarre expectations regarding candidate behavior during the hiring process.

### Case Study: Arriving "Exactly On Time" for an Interview
A candidate was rejected for a full-time job because they arrived "exactly on time" for their interview, rather than "a little earlier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This is described as the "absolute most ridiculous reason to reject somebody," as it could have been a "superstar candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Such an expectation points to an overly "power hungry" recruiter or hiring manager with "absolutely ridiculous requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Demands for Unpaid Work and Intellectual Property

A significant red flag is when employers expect candidates to perform unpaid work or provide free intellectual property as part of the interview process.

### Case Study: Unpaid "Test Work" During Interviews
A hiring manager asked a candidate to come in and "work for a couple of hours to see if you like the job," but refused to pay for the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. When the candidate questioned compensation, the manager aggressively stated it wouldn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This signals a "very, very toxic work environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Job seekers should "never be offering or being required to work for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Case Study: Demanding Free Consultative Services/Projects
Companies sometimes require candidates to produce projects, case studies, or presentations as part of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. If these projects involve solving an actual business scenario the company is facing, and the candidate is not compensated, it amounts to getting "free consultative services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Instances exist where companies have taken candidates' ideas and implemented them without hiring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. A reputable company should not make you do this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, emphasizing the importance of valuing oneself and not giving away "free intellectual property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This highlights common [[issues_with_unpaid_work_expectations | issues with unpaid work expectations]].

### Case Study: Unpaid Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Role
A job posting for a Marketing Manager/Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) position at a startup explicitly states that the role will initially be "part-time unpaid" while the founding team secures VC funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Only after funding is secured would the role transition to a full-time, paid basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This is an "absolute doozy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, asking a senior-level candidate with executive potential to work for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This is seen as a "proverbial carrot hanging" in front of desperate job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Such startups often lack business acumen or proper HR/talent acquisition departments, leading to "wild wild west" practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Misleading Salary Ranges and Job Descriptions

Some companies employ tactics to circumvent transparency laws or combine unrelated job functions.

### Case Study: Extreme Salary Range in Pay Transparency State
In states with pay transparency laws, where companies must publish salary ranges, some employers post incredibly broad ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. One big tech company posted a base salary range of $150,000 to $890,000 for a single role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This massive $700,000 spread is interpreted as the company being "shady" and unwilling to disclose a realistic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This tactic does "nothing for the job seeker" and indicates potential deceit throughout the hiring process and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This directly relates to [[misleading_promises_by_employers | misleading promises by employers]] and [[understanding_pay_and_benefits_expectations | understanding pay and benefits expectations]].

### Case Study: Website Business Developer & Landscaper
A position for a "website business developer and landscaper" offers $25 an hour (Canadian, which is less in US dollars) for a part-time, 8-16 week contract role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. The role requires:
*   Website development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   Advertising and sales skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.
*   Up to 50% physical labor for landscaping and snow removal in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   Candidates must be registered with a Canadian second post-secondary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

This "mom and pop" operation combines highly disparate skills, expecting a business student with web development expertise to also perform manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This is another example of [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | challenges with unrealistic employer demands in job postings]].

## Unrealistic Internship Demands

The issue of [[employer_expectations_from_recent_college_graduates | employer expectations from recent college graduates]] extends to internships.

### Case Study: Internship Requiring Advanced Skills and Certifications
A four-month student internship listing requires candidates to have:
*   Advanced knowledge of insurance and wealth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   Understanding of advisor compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   Knowledge of internal admin systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   Post-secondary education in a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   Professional designations like CPA, CFA, or CSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   Advanced analytical skills with Power BI, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

This is an "impossible internship" where employers are "expecting the moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. The "ask for employers is just so skewed from reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, as it is unrealistic for an intern to possess such extensive background and professional qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. This exemplifies [[internship_expectations_and_challenges | internship expectations and challenges]].

## Bizarre Application Requirements

Some job applications include highly unusual and intrusive requests.

### Case Study: Photo of the Inside of Your Fridge
At the end of a job application, alongside attaching a resume, applicants were asked to provide "a photo of the inside of your fridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The criteria for what kind of fridge condition is valued (messy vs. meticulously neat) remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. This kind of request is seen as either a recruiter being "cute" or a hiring manager with "unrealistic expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. It points to a "cumbersome interview process at best or a red flag employer at worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## Conclusion: Recognizing Red Flags

These examples of absurd job requirements and employer behaviors underscore a broader issue within [[changing_expectations_in_the_modern_workplace | changing expectations in the modern workplace]] and [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employer-employee relationship dynamics]]. Such postings are "literally telling you where [they are] low quality employers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Job seekers are encouraged to have "self-respect" and avoid applying for "red flag employers" as it is "not worth it in your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Working for a "toxic employer" will not help one get ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. The most challenging employers are those who do not immediately reveal their red flags, making assessment difficult until one is already employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

The traditional career model, which suggested selecting a career at age 18, dedicating 40 years to it, and then collecting a pension upon retirement, is considered "completely dead" in the [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | modern workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This former model was based on an expectation of mutual loyalty between employer and employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Traditional Career (Past Generations)

Many people recall their grandparents or parents experiencing long, traditional careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In the past, individuals often entered the workforce at 18 with relative ease, sometimes through nepotism or by simply submitting a basic resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. These careers often spanned 45 years and included substantial pension plans, culminating in a well-wished retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Employer-employee relationships were characterized by a degree of loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Layoffs were not constant, and if an employee wasn't excelling in one role, they might be moved to another department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Hiring was a localized process, often within a specific geographic region where one or two major employers dominated the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Collapse of the Traditional Model

Several factors have contributed to the collapse of the traditional career and [[employer_expectations_vs_reality | changing dynamics in the modern workplace]]:

### "What Have You Done for Me Lately" Culture
The [[changing_dynamics_in_the_modern_workplace | modern workplace]] operates on a "what have you done for me lately" principle, driven by instant gratification and a focus on immediate results and earnings reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This means past successes do not guarantee future job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Globalized Job Market and Competition
Unlike the past, the global economy and the rise of job boards like LinkedIn allow candidates to apply for thousands of jobs across the globe from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This has drastically increased competition, with thousands of applicants vying for single positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Short-Term Mentality and Layoff Cycles
Companies now operate with a short-term mentality, leading to frequent cycles of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. These cycles, which involve periods of economic expansion and company bloat followed by major events that trigger layoffs and "right-sizing," appear to be shortening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

*   **Late 1990s - Early 2000s**: The dot-com bubble led to expansion and hiring, followed by a burst and mass layoffs after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Mid-2000s - 2008**: Economic recovery and bloat led to layoffs with the subprime real estate bubble burst in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **2010 - 2020**: A decade of uninterrupted growth and company bloat culminated in the economic shutdown due to the pandemic in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Post-2020**: Companies have continued "right-sizing" every couple of years, leading to a perception that the employment market is being destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

In contrast to previous generations, employees today are far more susceptible to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Employers can more easily lay off staff due to the vast pool of available labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Shift in Retirement Benefits
A significant [[changes_in_workplace_loyalty | decoupling in the workplace]] occurred with the shift from defined benefits plans (pensions where employers fully funded retirement) to defined contribution plans (like 401ks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This transition, which happened primarily between the 1970s and 1990s, shifted the burden of retirement savings onto the employee, with employers often only providing a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Furthermore, long vesting periods (often four or more years) for employer matching contributions mean that if an employee is laid off before vesting, they lose the employer's contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This further reduces employer commitment and fosters a lack of loyalty from both sides, though the employer is seen as the primary driver of this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Rise of Disruptive Technologies
The emergence of disruptive technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), is anticipated to displace millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. AI provides another means for employers to detach loyalty from employees, as they may no longer need human labor in the same capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Navigating the New Workplace
The [[changes_in_work_culture_postpandemic | changing dynamics in the modern workplace]] mean the traditional career no longer exists and will not return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The approach to work is rapidly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Looking forward, individuals should expect:
*   More common short-term assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   [[strategies_to_navigate_the_modern_job_market | Job hopping]] becoming less taboo, as frequent layoffs make stable resumes challenging to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   A continued rise in contract positions, as employers seek to avoid the costs associated with full-time employees and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Employees must [[adapting_to_a_changing_labor_market | re-evaluate how they fund their retirement]], as relying on employer-funded 401ks is no longer reliable due to frequent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. There are even suggestions to move the retirement age to 70 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

> "This is all necessitating us to look at our careers much more strategically, much more as a free agent and much more as the CEO of our career because we won't be able to rely on an employer to look out for our best interest the way our grandparents or our parents may have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

This [[adapting_to_a_changing_labor_market | requires a strategic and proactive approach to career management]], viewing oneself as a "free agent" and the "CEO" of one's own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Quitting Your Job
Quitting your job typically means leaving on your own terms, reflecting a proactive approach to [[career_management_and_planning | career management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Advantages of Quitting
*   **Control and Autonomy**: You leave on your own terms, acting as a "free agent" and making a proactive move to better your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Gain**: Often, you can achieve bigger pay increases by testing the open market, especially if you've been with one company for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Preparedness**: You likely have a new job lined up, ensuring a smoother transition and readiness to make the move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Future Options**: If done correctly, you may be eligible for rehire at your previous company, providing a valuable safety net if your new role or the economy turns unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Job Search Advantage**: It is easier to find a new job when you are already employed, reducing pressure and allowing for better negotiation power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Interview Narrative**: You can control the narrative in job interviews, effectively explaining your reasons for leaving your previous position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Quitting
*   **Rehire Eligibility**: Burning bridges when leaving can make you ineligible for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**: The "grass isn't always greener"; your new employer might be similar to your old one, or market conditions could change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Loss of Benefits**: You will not receive a severance package and are unlikely to collect unemployment benefits, unless you can prove a toxic work environment was your only option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Getting Fired
Being fired means your employer decides to end your employment arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Advantages of Being Fired
*   **Unemployment Eligibility**: If fired for poor performance (not gross negligence like theft or causing a fight), you are likely eligible to collect unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. If you were on a performance improvement plan (PIP) and still terminated for performance, it may not be the worst outcome as you can collect unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Being Fired
*   **Stigma**: There is a significant stigma associated with being fired, making it a difficult conversation for you and potential future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Interview Challenges**: You will need to explain poor performance or other difficult reasons for termination during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control**: Termination is not on your terms; it can happen abruptly, thrusting you into the job market unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **No Rehire/References**: You are unlikely to be eligible for rehire or receive positive references from the former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While employers generally won't disclose termination during employment verification, they may check references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Being Laid Off
A layoff occurs when an employer eliminates your job altogether, often due to business restructuring rather than individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Advantages of Being Laid Off
*   **Unemployment Benefits**: You are almost always eligible for unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Severance Package**: Many layoff situations include a severance package, which may consist of a lump sum of money, continuation of benefits, and access to outplacement services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Rehire Eligibility**: Depending on your performance, you might be eligible for rehire by the company that laid you off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Being Laid Off
*   **Lack of Control**: Layoffs are rarely on your terms and can often catch individuals completely off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Most people are not adequately prepared to weather the storm of a layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Stiff Competition**: Mass layoff events can lead to abnormally stiff competition as many individuals enter the labor market simultaneously seeking similar jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Stigma and Bias**: Despite being often performance-agnostic, there can still be a stigma associated with being laid off in an interview setting, with some employers perceiving laid-off individuals as "damaged goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Specific Scenarios and Strategies

### Poor Performance Track Record
If you have a track record of poor performance and are on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), it might be better to be terminated (if strictly performance-related) rather than quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This allows you to collect unemployment and potentially have some continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, as there's no real advantage to quitting in terms of references or rehire eligibility in this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Softening Market or Impending Layoffs
If the industry or broader market is softening, and your company has not yet announced layoffs, it may be beneficial to wait before quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Quitting just weeks before a major layoff could mean missing out on a severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Employer Perspective in Interviews
*   **Termination for Cause**: This is the hardest to overcome in an interview, as it raises red flags and prompts deeper scrutiny of your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Layoff**: For mass layoff events, it's acceptable to simply state you "got caught up in a mass reduction in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, be prepared to address potential bias from outdated employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Quitting**: This generally gives you the most strength, but employers still want to hear good, well-reasoned explanations for why you quit, not just that you left because you were upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

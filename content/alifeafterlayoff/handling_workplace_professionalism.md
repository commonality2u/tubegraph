Maintaining [[Managing workplace relationships | professional boundaries]] and exercising caution in communication are crucial for [[Managing workplace relationships | managing workplace relationships]] and preserving one's job and career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Loose lips can lead to significant trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## What Not to Say to Co-workers

A former HR professional compiled a list of common pitfalls that lead employees into difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>:

### 1. Actively Job Searching
Disclosing that you are in an active job search to co-workers is ill-advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Information spreads quickly through workplace whispers and will inevitably reach your boss, senior leaders, or HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This can expedite your exit from the company, even if you're not ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Additionally, be cautious about where you upload your resume online, especially if it shows your current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### 2. Negative Comments About Your Boss
Avoid speaking negatively about your boss, even if you feel that way or confide in a "work ally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Such comments almost always come back to harm you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### 3. Gossiping About Co-workers
Refrain from gossiping about other colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Developing a reputation as a gossip is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. If co-workers discover you're talking about them, they may file a complaint or go to management, drawing unwanted attention to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Regardless of how close your confidant is, the boss often finds out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 4. Sharing Your Salary
While salary transparency is generally beneficial for [[employee_value_and_workplace_respect | ensuring a level playing field]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, sharing your specific salary within your current company is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Doing so can lead to colleagues realizing they are underpaid, causing resentment and potentially leading them to confront management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This often results in management losing [[trust_and_credibility_in_professional_settings | trust]] in those who shared their salaries, potentially preventing [[managing_workplace_dynamics_and_promotions | promotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It is better to share salary information anonymously on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Team Blind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### 5. Borrowing Money or Engaging in Business Ventures
Avoid borrowing money from co-workers or entering into business relationships with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Such arrangements often become complicated and usually end poorly, especially for the person who lent the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Asking for money can also put colleagues in an uncomfortable situation, potentially leading to HR complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### 6. Complimenting Physical Attributes
Never compliment co-workers on their physical attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Even if you intend it innocently, the recipient may interpret it differently and feel uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. HR departments frequently receive complaints about such comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While general, professional compliments (e.g., on a new hairdo) are acceptable, keep them appropriate and avoid being "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### 7. Announcing a Colleague's Pregnancy
Do not presume or announce that a co-worker is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. If they are, you might force them to disclose it before they are ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. If they are not, you will likely offend them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Always allow the individual to take the lead on disclosing such personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### 8. Discussing Intent to Sue the Company
If you are involved in or planning litigation against the company, keep this information private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Do not spill details about your case or the company's alleged wrongdoings to co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This information can be used to defend against your claims or prompt the company to take proactive measures against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Confide only in your attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### 9. Telling Off-Color Jokes
Avoid telling off-color jokes in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Even if you perceive a joke as innocent, the recipient may find it offensive, leading to complaints to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The intent behind a joke doesn't matter as much as how it is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Stick to "dumb dad jokes" or avoid jokes altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This relates to [[workplace_communication_pitfalls | workplace communication pitfalls]].

### 10. Engaging in Political Discussions
In today's workplace, it is increasingly difficult but important to avoid political discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. No matter your stance, discussing politics is likely to be a "hot button" issue that will upset someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Such discussions often lead to arguments and rarely change anyone's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Consider the company's leanings as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. To prevent [[challenges_of_workplace_relationships_and_professional_boundaries | conflict]] and potential legal issues, it's best to take the high road and maintain a professional demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Conclusion
While it's fine to be friendly with co-workers, always treat them with a high degree of [[professional_demeanor_during_an_interview | professionalism]] and be very careful about what you say and disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Neglecting these rules can lead to [[consequences_of_workplace_complacency | negative consequences]] for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

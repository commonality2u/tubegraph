Job seeking and interviewing are inherently challenging, but encountering [[identifying_toxic_workplaces | low-quality employers]] who ask suspicious questions can make the process even harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Fortunately, employers often reveal "tells" that can help job seekers discern whether an opportunity is low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Listening carefully to certain questions can indicate that an employer is low quality, suggesting it may be wise to withdraw your candidacy and avoid future headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Red Flag Interview Questions

### 1. Unplanned Absences

A seemingly innocent question like "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?" can be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While employers might ask this to determine potential attendance issues, especially for hourly roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, a deeper meaning points to company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Indicator:** An intense focus on attendance suggests past issues and an overly particular approach to attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Warning:** This shows they anticipate attendance problems from you and indicates an inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Most people want the flexibility to call off when sick without repercussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Action:** Ask the interviewer about their expectations for unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If they are "cracking down" on it, it's likely a [[toxic_work_environments | toxic workplace]] to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### 2. Minimum Acceptable Salary

When an interviewer asks, "What's your minimum acceptable salary?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, they are essentially asking how cheaply they can acquire your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

*   **Indicator:** This suggests a lack of flexibility in compensation and a propensity to lowball candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Warning:** If they start by trying to pay you as little as possible, expect [[challenges_with_job_promotions_in_toxic_companies | struggles with raises and promotions]] later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This often means you will struggle to maintain a competitive salary in the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### 3. Commitment to Stay

A question like "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> points to deeper organizational issues.

*   **Indicator:** This is a strong sign of a high turnover problem within the company or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Warning:** Such a question implies that people are leaving quickly, suggesting a larger cultural problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It has little to do with your potential success and more with the employer's biases or cultural issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### 4. Past Termination

The question "Have you ever been fired?" can be a sensitive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

*   **Indicator:** This question is often irrelevant to your ability to perform the current job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Past performance, especially in a negative situation, isn't always the best predictor of future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Warning:** An employer focusing on this might have a bias or be quick to judge based on past negative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Action:** Redirect the conversation to your accomplishments and future capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If they continue to probe or give you "grief," it's advisable to withdraw your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### 5. Accusations of Resume Embellishment

If an interviewer accuses you of exaggerating or embellishing your resume (assuming you haven't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, this is a major [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | red flag]].

*   **Indicator:** This shows an immediate lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. They either think you're lying or assume everyone is lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Warning:** This is a clear [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | sign of a toxic employer]] and indicative of a distrustful culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### 6. Focus on Failures

Questions like "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> can be a trap.

*   **Indicator:** Such questions offer little valuable insight and can be used to develop a bias against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While they might aim to understand how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Action:** When answering, minimize time spent on the failure and maximize focus on how you overcame adversity to turn it into a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### 7. Availability for Off-Shifts/Weekends or On-Site for Remote Roles

For hourly roles, asking about availability on off-shifts or weekends, or for remote roles, asking about on-site availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, can be concerning.

*   **Indicator:** This often implies an expectation of frequent, possibly involuntary, overtime, signaling a poor work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For remote jobs, it suggests it's actually a hybrid role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, with a high likelihood of transitioning to 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Action:** Push back to get clear expectations for true work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. For remote roles, this is a significant [[signs_you_should_quit_your_job | red flag]] if you seek a truly remote-first position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### 8. Dealing with Rude Co-workers or Managers

The question "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> is a strong indicator of a negative environment.

*   **Indicator:** Your immediate thought should be, "Am I going to be working with difficult people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> If the rudeness applies to management, it's a critical [[toxic_work_environments_and_management | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Warning:** This is a clear [[impact_of_a_toxic_work_environment | red flag]] of a cultural issue within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### 9. Lack of Opportunity to Ask Questions

The absence of an opportunity for you to ask questions during an interview is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

*   **Indicator:** The interviewer dominating the conversation suggests they forget an interview is a two-way street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. You should be assessing the company as much as they are assessing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Warning:** If an employer takes offense to you asking questions professionally, it shows they feel "above you" and don't believe you should be evaluating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This points to a problematic company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

One or two of these questions alone don't necessarily mean a company is poor quality, but they serve as important data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. If you encounter these [[toxic_workplaces_and_their_effects | toxic workplace indicators]], it's crucial to ask thorough probing questions to fully understand the cultural issues before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Navigating the job market and interviews can be challenging, particularly when dealing with low-quality employers who ask suspicious questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, employers often reveal "tells" that can indicate if an opportunity is low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. By paying close attention, job seekers can discern whether to proceed with an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

It is crucial to approach [[Job search strategies | job seeking]] and [[Strategies for job searching and career advancement | interviewing]] by taking control and attracting high-quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Think of yourself as the CEO of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags in Interviews

Interviewers may ask questions that seem off-putting or off-center, indicating a potentially low-quality employer that you might want to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While one or two red flag questions don't necessarily mean a company is poor quality, they serve as crucial data points to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Here are some questions and scenarios that could signal a problematic workplace:

### 1. Questions About Unplanned Absences
If an interviewer asks, "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, this may indicate that the company has dealt with attendance issues previously and will be overly particular about attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This suggests a potentially inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Ask the interviewer about their expectations regarding unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If they indicate a strict crackdown, it could be a sign of a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### 2. Inquiries About Minimum Acceptable Salary
A question like "What's your minimum acceptable salary?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> reveals an employer's intention to find the cheapest option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This suggests little flexibility in compensation and implies that the employer will likely try to "nickel and dime you" in the future, impacting competitive salary maintenance and promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### 3. Demands for Commitment to Stay
When asked, "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, it's often a red flag for a turnover issue within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Consider why people are leaving quickly enough for the employer to need to assess this in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### 4. Questions About Being Fired
An interviewer asking if you have "ever been fired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> is generally inappropriate. Your past employment decisions are not their business, and past performance doesn't always predict future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Redirect the question to focus on your future performance and accomplishments in past roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If the interviewer continues to probe or expresses discomfort, withdrawing your candidacy may be best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### 5. Accusations of Exaggeration on Resume
If an interviewer accuses you of "exaggerating or embellishing any part of your resume" (assuming you haven't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, it indicates a lack of trust from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This signals a potentially toxic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### 6. "What's Your Biggest Failure?"
This question is often considered a trap, as it focuses on past failures rather than learning from adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Minimize time discussing the failure itself and focus on how you overcame the adversity, turning it into a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### 7. Inquiries About Off-Shift or Weekend Availability (for core shifts)
For roles with set shifts, asking about availability for off-shifts or weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> often implies mandatory, potentially unwelcomed, overtime and a poor work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Push back to get clear expectations for true work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 8. Questions About On-Site Availability for Remote Roles
If a remote job interviewer asks about your availability to come on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, it suggests the position is not truly remote, but hybrid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Be wary if a hybrid role is pitched as fully remote, as it may eventually become 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### 9. How Do You Deal with Rude Coworkers or Managers?
Being asked, "How do you deal with rude coworkers or managers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> immediately raises concerns about the existing work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This question is a significant red flag for cultural issues within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### 10. Lack of Opportunity for You to Ask Questions
If the interviewer dominates the conversation and does not allow you to ask questions of your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, it's a red flag. An interview is a two-way street where you should also be assessing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. If they take offense to you asking questions, it implies they believe they are "above you" and not subject to your assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

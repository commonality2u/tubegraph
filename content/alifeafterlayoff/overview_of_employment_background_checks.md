Upon receiving a job offer, companies typically conduct a background check, and sometimes a drug screen, as a contingency for employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This process aims to verify the information provided by an applicant on their job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Initiation and Authorization

The job application, often submitted through an ATS system, is considered a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Applicants must certify that all information provided is accurate and correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This application becomes a permanent part of the employment record upon hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It often includes a section granting the employer the right to check the applicant's background once a job offer is extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. After signing an offer letter, an additional form typically authorizes the company to conduct [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_implications | criminal background checks]], [[verification_process_for_employment_and_education_history | employment verification]], and potentially drug screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Third-Party Verification

Employers generally outsource the background check process to specialized third-party companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These companies verify the applicant's information on behalf of the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## [[common_elements_included_in_a_background_check | Common Elements Included in a Background Check]]

Employers use various resources to check backgrounds, including database searches and direct verification with previous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### [[verification_process_for_employment_and_education_history | Employment Verification]]

*   **Process**: The most common starting point for [[verification_process_for_employment_and_education_history | employment verification]] is "Work Number," a database where millions of employers submit employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. If this database is insufficient, the third-party company may directly contact former employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Key Information Checked**: They verify that the applicant worked for the company, the dates of employment, and the titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Income Verification**: While Work Number may contain income data, employers generally do not check previous income as it is becoming an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Look-Back Period**: Most background checks for employment history go back approximately seven to ten years, though some may check an applicant's entire work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Job Titles**: Modifying job titles to be more commonly accepted within an industry (e.g., "talent acquisition specialist" instead of "recruiter") is usually not an issue if the role level remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, changing a title to reflect a different or higher level (e.g., claiming to be a director when an individual contributor) can be a major red flag and cause problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Dates of Employment**: It is not recommended to falsify employment dates to add work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_implications | Criminal Background Check]]

*   **Categories**: Checks typically distinguish between felonies (more serious, often a barrier to employment) and misdemeanors (less serious) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A misdemeanor conviction may not generally prevent job acquisition, but it depends on the nature of the conviction, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis by the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Look-Back Period**: Generally, criminal background checks go back about seven years, but felonies from before this period may still be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. They also check for pending court cases and active warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Verification Process**: The third party contacts local courthouses in all locations where the applicant has lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Delays can occur if courthouses have antiquated, non-electronic record systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Juvenile Infractions**: [[criminal_background_checks_and_their_implications | Criminal background checks]] typically do not report on juvenile infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Disclosure**: It is always better to disclose any criminal background at the time of the offer to ensure the employer is fully aware and there are no surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Education Verification

*   **Scope**: This check verifies that the applicant attended the schools or obtained the degrees and certifications claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This includes high school, colleges, and professional certifications (e.g., CPA license) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Process**: Verifiers contact the universities or institutions directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This process is usually quick because educational institutions are accustomed to such requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Failing a Background Check

If a background check uncovers discrepancies or issues, the employer receives a detailed report outlining what could or could not be verified, along with any exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The employer may then choose to circle back with the applicant for clarification or potentially withdraw the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. It is in the applicant's best interest to proactively respond to any requests for additional information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Importance of Honesty

It is crucial to be honest on a job application because it is a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If an employer discovers that an applicant has falsified credentials, even after hiring, the individual can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Lying on an application, for instance by having a friend or family member act as an employment verifier, carries a high likelihood of the offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It is recommended to be forthcoming and ensure credentials are genuinely held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

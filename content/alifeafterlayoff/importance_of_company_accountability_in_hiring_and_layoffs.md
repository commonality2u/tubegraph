The recent softening of the labor market has highlighted a significant issue: a perceived lack of [[employee_wellbeing_and_company_accountability | company accountability]] in how they manage employment, particularly during periods of mass layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. The way companies handle the entire process of employment, including [[handling_layoffs_and_terminations_at_companies | handling layoffs]], has worsened since 2020, with many failing to treat people with dignity and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Reckless Hiring and the Subsequent Downturn

Companies engaged in an "economic boom" where large wage increases and rapid hiring, especially in the tech industry, were common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This environment was unsustainable, and the market quickly corrected, leading to widespread layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Despite the market shift, companies are still criticized for hiring recklessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Senior leadership may view employees merely as numbers on a spreadsheet, forgetting that they are individuals with lives, families, mortgages, hopes, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. These jobs were taken with the expectation of career advancement, which is often wiped away by sudden layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Disturbing Examples of Layoff Handling

The professional [[handling_of_layoffs_by_human_resources | manner in which layoffs are handled]] has become a "heads scratcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Examples of particularly distasteful [[handling_layoffs_and_terminations_at_companies | layoff practices]] include:

*   **Google Employee** A Google employee of over 10 years, forced to return to the office, discovered his layoff when his badge no longer worked at the building entrance, with no prior email or call from management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This demonstrated extreme disrespect, costing the employee time and gas money for a pointless commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Business Trips** Individuals have been notified of their layoffs while in the middle of company business trips, leaving them stranded and embarrassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **During Labor** A particularly shocking instance involved a person being laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **New Hires** A person who left their previous company to join Google was laid off after only 13 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. There was no [[employee_wellbeing_and_company_accountability | accountability]] for how this disrupted their life, especially since they would have remained employed at their previous company had they not been recruited away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Zillow's Cycle** Zillow laid off recruiting staff in late 2022 but then began posting the same jobs shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This raises questions about why they didn't rehire the previously laid-off employees, especially if performance was not the reason for termination, or why they failed to forecast staffing needs appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

Such behavior leads to widespread employee dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## The Demise of Corporate Loyalty

The concept of [[corporate_trust_and_transparency_during_layoffs | corporate loyalty]] is considered dead, having faded with the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The days of working decades for a single company and collecting a pension are largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Stability in employment is no longer guaranteed; companies often operate on an "instant gratification" model, initiating layoffs the moment difficulties arise, only to rehire in a rush later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This creates a repeating cadence of job instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

## Holding Companies Accountable

Employees must start acting selfishly in their careers, as nobody else will prioritize their best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. This means always looking out for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. People should actively hold companies accountable for their poor behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. One way to do this is by carefully choosing which companies to accept offers from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. If a company has a history of misbehavior, it is like casting a vote against them by declining their offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. During interviews, job seekers should assess how companies behaved during the economic boom and current downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

Companies view employees as "human resources"â€”a term often disliked but accurate in its implication that individuals are numbers on a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. As long as an employee is considered useful, they have a job; the moment they are not, their position can be eliminated without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. Therefore, individuals owe their employer nothing more than an honest day's work for an honest day's pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Acting Like a Free Agent
> [[acting_like_a_free_agent | Acting like a free agent]] involves consistently looking out for one's own career best interest first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. This means continually thinking for oneself and being selfish, as job security is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. An example includes a person who, after being laid off, secured a new job with a significant raise and then pursued an even better offer, even if it meant leaving the new job after only a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. This approach ensures one is always making the best decision for their career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

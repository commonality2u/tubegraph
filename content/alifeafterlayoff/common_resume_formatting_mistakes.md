A well-crafted resume is crucial for making a strong first impression on recruiters and hiring teams, especially in a competitive job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. To ensure your resume stands out positively and avoids immediate disqualification, it's essential to understand and avoid common formatting errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Visual Elements and Design

Certain visual elements can distract from your qualifications or lead to issues with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

### Excessive Graphics and Colors
Avoid using bright graphics, charts, or clip art on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While some subtle color for a job title (e.g., blues, blacks, or magenta) might be acceptable, overly colorful designs can be distracting and appear unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Your resume should be clean and concise, focusing on your background rather than aesthetic embellishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*An exception to this rule is if you are in a creative field, such as an art director or graphic designer, where such elements might be expected to showcase creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.*

### Infographics for Skill Proficiency
Do not use infographics (e.g., bars or stars) to demonstrate skill proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Showing a low proficiency level (e.g., 3 out of 10 bars) can highlight a weakness in a skill important to the employer, potentially leading to self-elimination from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It is generally better to allow employers to assess your skills during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Multiple Columns
Avoid using multiple columns in your resume design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) typically parse information from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Resumes with multiple columns, especially for listing skills, can cause the ATS to misread or miss information in subsequent columns, making your skills invisible to recruiters conducting keyword searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

> "We always want to be as discoverable as possible, so it's a simple fix, just get rid of the columns altogether." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

## Personal Information and Identifiers

Including certain personal details can lead to unconscious bias or discrimination.

### Photographs
In the U.S. and North America, do not include a photograph of yourself on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Recruiters may assume candidates including photos are not U.S.-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

> [!INFO] Country-Specific Practice
> If you are applying in a country where photographs are customary on resumes, then follow the local tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Protected Class Information
Exclude personal identifiers such as gender, race, creed, color, or marital status (e.g., "married with two kids") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This information is not work-related and could be used by an unscrupulous employer to discriminate against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Unprofessional Email Addresses
Ensure your email address is professional and neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Avoid addresses that are "colorful," include nicknames, or date back to college years (e.g., "partyboy28@yahoo.com") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. A simple format using your full name is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Full Street Addresses
Do not include your full street address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Only your city and state are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Providing a specific address can lead to assumptions about commute distance, potentially resulting in discrimination based on perceived travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Even for remote roles, city and state are important for time zone considerations and taxation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Content and Experience

Certain content choices can make your resume less effective or reveal unnecessary details.

### Irrelevant or Outdated Work History
Generally, avoid including work history older than 10 years, unless it's a senior executive position requiring extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Employers typically focus on your last 5-10 years of experience, as older skills may no longer be relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Industry-Specific Jargon and Acronyms
Do not use industry-specific jargon, unique job titles, or acronyms that are not widely understood outside your specific company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This makes it harder for recruiters and hiring managers to quickly understand your capabilities and reduces your discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Excessive Education Details
Avoid providing too much detail about your degrees or specific courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. State the institution and degree type, but omit minor degrees or detailed course listings unless you are entry-level and need those keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### GPA (for experienced professionals)
If you are more than three years out of college, do not include your GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Employers generally do not care about it at that stage of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. If you are entry-level or have less than three years of experience, it can be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Internships (for experienced professionals)
Similar to GPA, if you have been in the workforce for more than three years, you can remove internships from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. They are not typically counted as total years of experience and become "vanity stats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### References
Do not list actual references or state "references available upon request" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Recruiters will ask for references if needed, and checking references is becoming less common for many employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Salary History or Expectations
Never include previous salary history or expected compensation on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Disclosing this information can lock you into a lower salary or open you up to a lowball offer, even if the employer has a healthier pay range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This information will be discussed in the first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Skill and Competency Description

How you describe your skills and competencies impacts your resume's effectiveness.

### Generic Skills
Avoid listing universal or generic skills like Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. These are industry standards and are generally assumed for professional-level jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Save valuable resume space for more specific or advanced skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Cliche Jargon
Do not use generic or cliche jargon such as "team player" or "fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. These phrases are overused and do not provide concrete evidence of your abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Instead, demonstrate these competencies through bullet points detailing your achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

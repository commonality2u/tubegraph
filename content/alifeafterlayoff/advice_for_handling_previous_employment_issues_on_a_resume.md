When facing a difficult job search, it can be tempting to embellish or "flub" details on a resume to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises that while he would never condone outright lying on a resume to get hired on merits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, there are specific circumstances where "painting in a few white lies" or "massaging" information might optimize chances of getting noticed by a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Recruiters often only give a resume a five-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, making initial presentation critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Situations Where Minor Adjustments Might Be Acceptable

It's important to distinguish between outright fabrication and subtle optimization. The goal is to make the resume more palatable to a recruiter for an initial call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

### Job Titles
If your past job title was proprietary, it's acceptable to change it on your resume to match more common or generic market terms that companies are actively recruiting for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. For example, if you were a "production engineer level 1" but the role is essentially a "manufacturing engineer," it's okay to list the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Recruiters are unlikely to call your previous company to verify the exact proprietary title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This helps make you more discoverable by common keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Contract Employment
If you worked as a contractor through a third-party agency but were embedded with and directly supporting a specific "name brand" company (e.g., having their email address, working as part of their team, having their staff as your boss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, it's acceptable to list the "alpha company" as your employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This can make your resume look better than listing an unknown third-party agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. However, be prepared to explain the contractual nature during the interview process, especially before background checks, to avoid hiccups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Location
If you are actively seeking to move to a new location, you can list an address in that target area on your resume to potentially get more calls in the local market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. However, you must be prepared to cover all relocation expenses yourself without assistance from the company, as they may have budgeted only for local candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Failing to disclose your true location later could cost you a potential relocation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

### Dates of Employment
You can use only years for employment dates (e.g., 2017-2020) rather than specific months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. This can help "massage" the resume and make it look "cleaner," especially if you have instances of [[challenges_with_job_hopping_and_resume_instability | job hopping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. An astute recruiter will ask for specific dates during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, at which point you must be honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. This approach is about not broadcasting specific dates, not about outright falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

### Skills
It's considered acceptable to claim a skill you don't possess *if* it's an easy skill to learn quickly and can be acquired before your potential start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. For example, if a job uses Google Docs and you've only used Microsoft Word, learning Google Docs in an hour or two makes it acceptable to claim the skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. However, do not lie about major skill sets, such as a computer programming language you've never used, as it would be impossible to learn in a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. The skill should be "readily available" for you to acquire and apply functionally in a job setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Leaving a Job
Do not explicitly advertise on your resume that you were fired, laid off, or quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. If an application asks why you left, you can leave it blank or state "better opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Directly stating you were fired will likely lead to automatic disqualification without a chance to explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. If asked directly in an interview, be honest and have a good explanation, particularly if you were fired "at the rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. This approach aligns with [[strategies_for_answering_why_did_you_leave_your_last_job | strategies for answering 'Why did you leave your last job']] without outright [[the_ethics_of_lying_on_a_resume | lying]].

## What Not to Lie About

Outright [[the_ethics_of_lying_on_a_resume | lying on a resume]] or application is considered falsification of an official document, which is a terminable offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Offers can be rescinded, and individuals can be terminated if lies are discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.

### Employer
Do not make up an employer you never worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. While minor adjustments for contractors are acceptable, outright fabrication will be exposed during the interview process or background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

### References
Never ask a friend to pretend to be a previous boss or reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>. If you are not on good terms with a previous boss, it's better to explain the situation articulately to the recruiter and try to provide an alternative suitable reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. Honesty, even about difficult situations, is preferred over fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

### Specific Dates of Employment
While being vague about months is acceptable, do not add years to your employment history to cover gaps or extend tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. Do not claim to be currently employed if you have been laid off and have a significant employment gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. This is considered flat-out falsification and will be revealed during background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. This is a common aspect of [[avoiding_common_resume_mistakes | avoiding common resume mistakes]].

### Non-Acquirable Skills
Do not lie about complex skills that cannot be easily and quickly learned before starting a job, such as a difficult computer programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. You will be exposed in the interview process or set up for failure on the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

### Education
Never lie about having a degree or certification you do not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. Educational claims are checked during background checks by calling institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. Falsifying a degree will lead to a lost offer and potentially being blacklisted from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>. This falls under [[risks_of_falsifying_information_on_job_applications | risks of falsifying information on job applications]] and [[relevance_of_work_history_and_educational_details_on_resumes | relevance of work history and educational details on resumes]].

### Criminal Record
Do not omit or lie about a criminal record, especially a felony, if specifically asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. Background checks will expose this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. It's better to be honest and explain the situation, as outright non-disclosure will result in not getting the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>.

### Years of Experience
Do not lie about your total years of experience to meet job requirements (e.g., claiming five to seven years when you only have two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. This will be exposed during interviews, as you won't be able to demonstrate the claimed experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. Even if you were to get the job, you would likely be set up to fail as the role would expect someone with that experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>, leading to potential turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. It's advisable to find a role that is appropriate for your actual experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

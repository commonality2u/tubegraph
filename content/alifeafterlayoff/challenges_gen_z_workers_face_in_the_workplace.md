Bosses are reportedly firing Gen Z workers in record time, and there are several reasons why this trend is occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon has led to a significant number of recent college graduates being terminated in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Survey Findings on Gen Z Employment

A survey conducted by intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders involved in hiring decisions, revealed interesting insights into the attitudes towards recent college graduates (Gen Z) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   75% of companies reported having hired some Gen Z employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Six out of ten companies admitted to firing a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The study indicates that 75% of companies reported at least some issue with recent college grad hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The most frequently cited reasons for these new hires not working out include:
*   Lack of motivation or initiative (50% of employers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Lack of professionalism (nearly 46%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Lack of organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Lack of communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Challenges with feedback or not taking feedback well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Lack of relevant work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> (though this is noted as a potential disconnect given entry-level positions often require prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>)
*   Poor problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Insufficient technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Bad culture fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Difficulty working in a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

Companies are hiring Gen Z and entry-level employees but are quick to terminate them if there's a perceived cultural mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This suggests employers are "slow to hire, quick to fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Employer Perceptions of Gen Z Graduates

Hiring managers hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:
*   **Entitled**: 65-70% believe Gen Z is entitled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, often trying to get promoted too quickly without demonstrated skill or experience, and desiring high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Offended Easily**: 65% believe they get offended easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of Work Ethic**: This is a common perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Unprepared for the Workforce**: Many are seen as unprepared for the realities of the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Poor Communication Skills**: Cited as a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Lack of Motivation**: A frequently mentioned problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Costs More to Train**: Employers perceive them as requiring more training investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technological Skills**: Surprisingly, 28% reported a lack of technological skills, despite Gen Z growing up with modern devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Other behavioral observations include:
*   One in five (20%) say they can't often manage their workload and are unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   About 20% are often late to start and don't dress professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   19% often don't use appropriate language at work and are late to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   17% are believed to be too difficult to manage and often hand in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Disconnect from Education

There appears to be a significant cultural disconnect, with universities not adequately preparing students for success in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. There is a clear lack of transition training to acclimate individuals to the working world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Impact on Future Hiring

The negative experiences are leading some employers to consider drastic measures:
*   One in seven companies may not hire any college graduates in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   One out of six hiring managers is hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. They believe a stronger work ethic and a better attitude would make college graduates more hirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Case Studies and Anecdotes from the Workplace

Real-world examples from social media and comments corroborate these observations:

### Construction Company Owner's Perspective
A construction company owner in Southern California noted that problems are not limited to college grads, finding young people (under 30) to be "the most entitled and uneducated people I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Specific issues cited:
*   Lack of communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>
*   Zero critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   Devoid of motivation, requiring constant supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>
*   Zero attention to detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   Become frustrated at anything requiring persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
*   Refusal to separate from phones, making it impossible to focus for more than 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Emergency Department Nurse Example
A new nurse graduate in a busy emergency department would not stay off her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and was texting friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. When her phone was taken away and locked up, she had a "tantrum" and chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Consequently, the department stopped hiring new nurse grads, negatively impacting those with good work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Government IT Professional Example
A government IT professional shared that computer science grads hired for entry-level IT admin positions all left within six months due to lack of focus, attention, communication skills, urgency, professionalism, and "social and professional dysfunction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### TikTok Termination Stories

Several Gen Z individuals have shared their experiences of being fired:

#### Accounting Role Terminations
One Gen Z individual detailed being fired from two accounting roles:
*   **First Role**: Fired for being on her phone too much because the role was "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Despite warnings, she continued to use her phone, leading to management moving her desk directly in front of their own to monitor her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. She disliked being micromanaged and the "cliquey," "high school vibe" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Second Role**: Fired despite receiving positive feedback from her recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. She believed an "All-Star employee" spoke negatively about her, claiming she came in "whenever I felt like it" and thought she was "too good for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The terminated employee admitted she didn't like interacting with the complaining co-worker, and didn't dispute the firing as she disliked accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

#### Tardiness and No-Call, No-Show
Another individual was terminated for persistent tardiness and a no-call, no-show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Despite prior discussions about absenteeism and tardiness, she was late by 12 minutes, then 21 minutes, then 32 minutes on separate occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Her excuses included her cousin using her car and not bringing it back on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, and a no-call, no-show on her birthday, stating, "that was my birthday like don't get the no show on your just because it's your birthday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The speaker highlighted her sense of entitlement and lack of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

#### "Quiet Quitting"
One TikTok user stated he was fired because he "didn't do anything for 15 months and they found out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This points to a trend of "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place," where employees do minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. Employers are less tolerant of this behavior in the current job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Nuance and Broader Context

It's acknowledged that it's easy to generalize about Gen Z, but it's often "a few bad apples that spoil it for the rest of the generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Many highly motivated and driven Gen Z employees exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Every generation has faced similar feedback at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. It's important to show [[generational_perceptions_and_realities_in_the_job_market | Gen Z]] "a little bit of grace" because they are entering the workforce during one of the most difficult [[current_challenges_in_the_job_market | job markets]] ever experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Many college grads are applying to thousands of positions just to start their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Furthermore, Gen Z is helping to drive positive changes in the workplace, particularly regarding work-life balance, which is seen as a welcome development given the increasingly unhealthy and unbalanced nature of workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

## Advice for Gen Z Entering the Workforce

Employers are clear about their expectations for new hires:
*   Show initiative and a positive attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Demonstrate a strong work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   Be adaptable and open to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Be punctual and reliable; avoid being late to meetings or unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   Possess solid technical and interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Seek out internship experience as early as possible in degree programs, as it provides valuable work experience that employers look for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Maintain a work-appropriate social media presence, as employers often check social media during the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Avoid posting about slacking off at work or engaging in political topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Understand workplace norms regarding phone usage and time management; constant phone use can lead to issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

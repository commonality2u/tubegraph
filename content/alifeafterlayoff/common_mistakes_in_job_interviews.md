Getting interviews is a significant achievement, indicating you are "ahead of the curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, if you are not receiving job offers, it's likely due to several issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The current job market is highly competitive, with an abundance of qualified candidates, allowing employers to be very selective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. To succeed, you need to bring your "A game" to the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Brian, a recruiter and human resources professional with 20 years of experience, has hired thousands of people for prestigious companies, ranging from receptionists to c-suite executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He has participated in countless debriefings discussing why one candidate received an offer and another did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This article outlines five [[common_job_interview_mistakes | common mistakes]] people make in interviews, offering "tried and true and battle tested tips" directly from employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Five [[common_job_interview_mistakes | Common Mistakes]] in Job Interviews

### 1. Talking Too Much

One of the first and most [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | common mistakes]] is talking too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This often stems from nerves or not truly understanding the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It can also indicate a lack of emotional intelligence, meaning an inability to gauge another person's emotions or cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Interviewers often provide verbal or physical feedback to indicate if you are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Candidates who talk too much might start speaking before formulating an answer, then diverge into unrelated stories, often failing to answer the original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Every interview question serves a specific purpose, aiming to learn aspects of your background relevant to the job profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

> "It's better to pause the interview and put the question back on me and say, 'Hey, I think that you're asking me about this, but can you clarify? I just want to make sure that I'm giving you the right information.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

Clarifying the question shows self-awareness and business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Recruiters are not trying to trap you and are usually happy to clarify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. In general, it's better to give not enough detail than too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Provide a thorough yet concise answer, and a skilled interviewer will ask probing questions if more information is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### 2. Not Being Prepared

Lack of preparation is a significant [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Showing up without having read the job description, visited the company website, or knowing the interviewer's name creates a poor [[first_impressions_in_job_interviews | first impression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This indicates you're not taking the job or your career seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Unpreparedness also reflects poorly on the recruiter who sent you to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. It is almost guaranteed you won't get the position if you show up completely unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. It's better to reschedule the interview than to attend unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

```ad-tip
**Do Your Research:**
*   Visit the company website, especially the careers section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Review the specific job posting you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Check Glassdoor reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   Prepare for core competency and behavior-based interview questions by thinking of relevant scenarios from your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
```

### 3. Being Over Prepared

Taking preparation to the extreme can also be a [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While showing engagement, reciting a "book report" of obscure company data or being overly rehearsed can be "a little overboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

If your interview answers are too scripted, any deviation can make you appear robotic, trip you up, increase nervousness, and make you seem inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

```ad-hint
**Authenticity is Key:**
*   Some rehearsing is encouraged, but too much is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Think of selling yourself as a series of "story arcs" from your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   If you've genuinely done what you're discussing, you should be able to speak about it with passion and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
```

### 4. Not Being Enthusiastic Enough

A lack of enthusiasm can make it seem like you don't really want the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Hiring managers prefer candidates who are energetic and excited, as enthusiasm is "infectious" and they want to be surrounded by positive, upbeat people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. If enthusiasm doesn't come naturally, especially for introverts, it's something that should be practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### 5. Not Asking Any Questions

Not asking questions after meeting with key stakeholders or the hiring manager is a [[common_interview_mistakes_to_avoid | common mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If you don't inquire about your role's contribution, specific objectives, or the department's success, you'll be perceived as disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Remember that interviewing is a "two-way street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>; you should be interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Being selective about the roles you accept is important if you are passionate about your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

```ad-important
**Ask Thoughtful Questions:**
*   Come prepared with good questions for the hiring team and manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Ask about the culture to ensure it's the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Asking questions impresses teams and shows you could be a very engaged employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
```

"Career cushioning" is the latest employment trend emerging in the job market, following phenomena like the "Great Resignation," "Quiet Quitting," and "Quiet Firing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept involves proactively preparing for the potential loss of your job by setting up a safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It's about taking steps to ensure you're protected, acting like a "free agent" in your [[career_management_and_development | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Evolution of Employment Trends

To understand career cushioning, it's helpful to look at recent shifts in the employment market:

*   **2020 Economic Downturn & Pandemic Response**
    *   A major economic downturn in 2020, due to the pandemic, led many employers to implement knee-jerk layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   Remaining employees faced increased work burdens, stress, and long hours under the pervasive mantra of "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   Employers demanded more while cutting expenses, leading to widespread burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This environment prompted many to reevaluate their career desires, particularly those who felt unceremoniously dismissed or overworked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

*   **The Great Resignation**
    *   This period marked a significant shift in power towards the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. People began to step back and demand more, leading to a "job seeker buyer market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   During this "Heyday of job seeking," opportunities were abundant, with many receiving raises and leaving jobs for better pay, even from stable environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

*   **Quiet Quitting**
    *   As a response to burnout, but without wanting to leave their jobs, some employees embraced "quiet quitting," doing the minimum required without disengaging fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The risk of being fired was low due to the abundance of job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **Quiet Firing**
    *   The pendulum then began to swing back towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Hiring slowed, and companies looked for ways to encourage employees to quit rather than outright firing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Current Market Conditions and the Rise of Career Cushioning

As of December 2022, the labor market remains shaky and is moving towards increased uncertainty, with the pendulum appearing to swing more towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. While the overall labor market still shows strength, specific industries, particularly tech, have been hit hard by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives revealed that 50% are reducing their overall headcount despite concerns about hiring and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This indicates that companies are "right-sizing" after potential over-hiring during the boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Evidence includes widespread layoffs in major tech companies, hiring freezes, reduced headcounts, and the dropping of sign-on bonuses and perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. A concerning 44% of companies are also rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

These conditions have made [[career_navigation_in_times_of_layoffs_and_job_insecurity | career navigation in times of layoffs and job insecurity]] a critical skill, leading to the emergence of career cushioning.

## What is Career Cushioning?

Career cushioning essentially means proactively planning for the possibility of losing your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It's about building a "safety net" to land softer in case of an unplanned income disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. While the term is new, the concept of proactive [[career_strategy_and_coaching | career strategy and coaching]] is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

It is particularly important for individuals who have become apathetic or overly comfortable in their jobs, as they are most at risk of being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Examples of Career Cushioning Activities:

*   **Updating your professional presence:** This includes updating your LinkedIn profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> and ensuring your resume is current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Market Research:** Looking at current job postings to understand what employers are seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Networking:** Actively building and leveraging professional networks to find potential opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This can involve soliciting the right people and reaching out to recruiters for "soft feelers," even if you're not actively job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Why Practice Career Cushioning?

Practicing career cushioning is 100% advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It aligns with the "free agent" mindset, where individuals prioritize their own career interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. By taking proactive steps, you can avoid being caught off guard by layoffs or unexpected job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

It is not a one-time activity but a consistent practice for [[career_advancement_through_selfinterest | career advancement through selfinterest]] and [[strategies_for_career_resilience_and_diversification | strategies for career resilience and diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This consistency helps transform potential "huge craters" into minor "hiccups" in your career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Practical Steps to Implement Career Cushioning:

1.  **Optimize your LinkedIn Profile:** Ensure your profile is optimized and tidy, understanding what recruiters look for and how they screen candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
2.  **Build Active Networks:** Actively build and cultivate networks on platforms like LinkedIn with people who could potentially assist you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  **Keep Your Resume Current:** Have an up-to-date resume so you're not scrambling if a layoff notice arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This is a crucial step in [[preparing_for_a_job_transition | preparing for a job transition]].
4.  **Define Your Career Goals:** Take a collective look at what you truly want in your [[career_management_and_development | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Evaluate your current skills, identify gaps, and formulate a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Doing this while gainfully employed reduces stress and helps you eliminate positions that don't align with your core values during an active job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

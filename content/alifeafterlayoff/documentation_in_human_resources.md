The Human Resources (HR) department is characterized by an obsession with documenting every detail within the employment arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This meticulous record-keeping, often requiring an employee's signature, serves primarily to limit the company's liability and can potentially be used to build a case against an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## The Documentation Process

Throughout an employee's journey, from the initial contact to departure, HR systematically collects signed documents:

*   **Application Process** When applying for a job, applicants sign a disclaimer at the bottom of the [[job_application_process_and_strategies | application process]] acknowledging their understanding of its terms and confirming the truthfulness of the information provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Job Offer** Upon receiving an [[improving_job_offer_processes | offer letter]], employees are required to sign, indicating their agreement to various terms, conditions, and legal disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Onboarding and Training** During the employment process, a background check requires a signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Orientation sessions involve reviewing and signing off on numerous policies and training documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The employee handbook also requires a signature to confirm its receipt and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Performance and Coaching** Employee performance appraisals necessitate a signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Any official "documented coaching sessions" also require an employee's signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Employee Complaints** When an employee chooses to [[human_resources_role_in_employee_disputes | complain about an employee or boss]] to HR, the department's first action is often to review the complaining employee's employment file to assess their history with the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Exit from Company** When an employee leaves the company, HR requires signatures on additional documents, particularly for severance packages which come with their own terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Purpose of Documentation

All collected documents are stored in an employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. If future issues arise, these documents will be used to defend the company's decisions against the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. HR's primary function is to limit the company's liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This focus on documentation is especially critical because if something is not written down, it can be very difficult to prove later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Self-Ranking for Layoffs

In preparation for [[handling_of_layoffs_by_human_resources | layoffs]], HR may ask employees to rank their own performance and skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This information, often collected under the guise of understanding the workforce and allocating resources, is used to determine if an employee's skills align with the company's long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Simultaneously, HR meets with managers to discuss team performance, reviews various metrics, and examines individual performance output and ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This gathered data is then used to identify employees for the layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

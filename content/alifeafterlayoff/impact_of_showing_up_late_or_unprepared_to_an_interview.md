Showing up late or unprepared for a job interview is often one of the first signs that a candidate might be a "red flag" to potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While employers also have their own red flags, job seekers should consider if their own actions are causing consistent rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_first_impressions_in_job_interviews | First Impressions]] are Crucial

The [[the_role_of_first_impressions_in_job_interviews | first impressions]] a candidate makes in an interview are very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Being late, unprepared, or even rescheduling at the last minute can immediately signal to employers that a candidate might not be worth the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Consequences of Lateness

If a candidate arrives 15 minutes late for an interview due to issues like traffic or difficulty finding parking, the interviewer will likely assume they do not manage their time effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This immediately creates a poor [[the_role_of_first_impressions_in_job_interviews | first impression]], forcing the candidate to try and overcome this negative perception for the remainder of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Consequences of Unpreparedness

Similarly, being unprepared for an interview can lead to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. There have been instances where candidates were clearly caught off guard when called for a pre-arranged interview, with one even being still asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Such experiences result in a bad [[the_role_of_first_impressions_in_job_interviews | first impression]] and often lead to poor performance, preventing the candidate from advancing to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Control What You Can

Being on time and prepared are factors entirely within a candidate's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. There is no valid excuse for these [[common_interview_mistakes | common interview mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. To avoid being seen as a "red flag" candidate, it is crucial to approach interviews with strategic preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

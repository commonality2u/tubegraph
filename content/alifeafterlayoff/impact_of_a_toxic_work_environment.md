Tolerating a job that is absolutely hated can be emotionally and physically draining, affecting not only the individual but also their loved ones, spouse, family, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A steady job should not be an excuse for tolerating a [[toxic_work_environments | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers understand the distinction between job hopping and leaving a bad situation, so individuals should not feel obligated to remain in a role that causes physical or mental harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Many people find themselves questioning whether to stay in their current [[toxic_work_environments | work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The decision to stay often depends on an individual's tolerance for a bad environment and its potential [[effects_of_a_bad_boss_on_career | impact on their career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Deal-Breaker Situations for Employment

There are five deal-breaker situations that necessitate leaving a job quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>:

### 1. Emotional or Physical Suffering

Working in a role that causes mental and physical distress is a clear sign to leave promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Being overworked, overwhelmed, or feeling "in over your head" can lead to health issues, affecting both the individual and those close to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Some severe cases have seen individuals' demeanor, outlook on life, and physical appearance change, even leading to the need for medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

If a job causes stress to the point of needing to see a doctor, it is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Symptoms of job-related stress include:
*   Loss of appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Sudden weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
*   Loss of sleep or sleepless nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   Loss of interest in previously enjoyed hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Anxiety or anxiousness, such as worrying about reports, meetings, uncomfortable conversations with a boss, or conflicts with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Physical manifestations like hair loss or developing hives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   A complete lack of motivation to do the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Dreading showing up to work every Monday morning due to worries about what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

Developing physical or mental ailments due to a job or career choice means it's crucial to leave quickly, as health is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Staying in an unhealthy role impacts time, money, career trajectory, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If the stress stems from the career itself rather than just the company, it may indicate a need to try a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### 2. Having a Terrible Boss

Working for a bad boss is a common experience in a professional career, and it's the most frequent reason people leave jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Dissatisfaction with a bad boss is the primary motivator for seeking other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. A bad boss can make a top performer feel like a failure, questioning their self-worth and negatively impacting their career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Examples include bosses cutting earned bonuses or publicly reprimanding employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Poor leaders often lack emotional intelligence and exhibit detrimental leadership traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Unlike good leaders who provide motivational feedback privately, poor leaders may scold colleagues in front of peers, give feedback that crushes morale, or dismiss ideas and demotivate through criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. If these circumstances exist, it's time to consider leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### 3. A [[toxic_work_environments | Toxic Work Culture]]

A company with a "win-at-all-costs" mentality often signals a bad or [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic work culture]], which typically originates from the top and leads to high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While competitiveness is healthy, winning at the expense of employees or ethical practices is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

If a company's published core values are not reflected by the leadership team in the workplace, it indicates a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. [[toxic_workplace_indicators | Indicators of a toxic culture]] include whispers at the water cooler, disrespect among colleagues in meetings, unrealistic goals, or a lack of recognition for accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Colleagues can also contribute to a [[toxic_work_environments | toxic work environment]] by making others' lives miserable, spreading rumors, or undermining them to the boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If such toxic influences are present and management is oblivious or even aligned with them, it's best to look elsewhere because the situation is unlikely to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Finding a position free from such [[toxic_workplaces_and_their_effects | toxicity]] is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### 4. Illegal Company Practices

If a company is breaking the law or asking an employee to do so, immediate departure is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Such situations indicate a complete lack of moral compass within the organization, and employees could be held personally liable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This includes financial shadiness, questionable environmental policies, or breaches of human resources laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

If illegal activities are observed, the first step should be to report them to the HR or legal department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. If no action is taken and the behavior persists, it's time to leave, as no job is worth jeopardizing one's professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### 5. Unsafe Work Conditions

Being asked to do something unsafe, or to skirt OSHA guidelines, demonstrates a company's lack of commitment to its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Safety is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. If something feels unsafe, concerns should be voiced to a boss or HR leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Any decent leader would immediately stop the work to address concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, if the company prioritizes profit over employee life or well-being, it is absolutely worth leaving the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. No job is worth risking life or limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Distinguishing Bad Situations from Challenges

While these five situations warrant leaving, it's important to distinguish them from surmountable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Companies value candidates who can persevere and find creative solutions in the face of adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. If an individual is merely bored or underutilized, they should take initiative, such as volunteering for process improvement projects or developing new skills to enhance their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

There is a fine line between job hopping and leaving a truly bad job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Individuals should not tolerate positions that expose them to the aforementioned scenarios solely for the sake of keeping a steady job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Ultimately, career ownership means taking the necessary steps to achieve desired goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

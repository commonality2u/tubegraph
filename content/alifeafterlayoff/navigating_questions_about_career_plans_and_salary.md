When heading into job interviews, it's crucial to be mindful of what you reveal, as certain information, though seemingly innocent, can put you at a disadvantage [00:00:59]. Interviewing can feel like navigating a minefield, where one misstep could lead to rejection [00:01:04].

Avoid revealing:
*   **Plans to start an unrelated business** [00:04:35].
*   **Intentions to switch careers after five years** or be in a completely different field [00:04:37].
*   **Short-term work horizons** [00:07:42]. For example, telling a hiring manager you only plan to work for three to five years, especially when they might be looking for someone for 10+ years, can create a bias against you [00:07:42].

Revealing these plans can signal to an employer that you lack passion for the type of work you are interviewing for [00:04:52].

<h4>Avoid Revealing Previous Salary</h4>

Instead of letting an employer determine your value, you, as the prospective employee, should determine your worth based on the open market for your specific skills, experiences, knowledge, and abilities [00:10:37].

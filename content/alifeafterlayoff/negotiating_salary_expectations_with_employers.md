When faced with the question "What's your [[salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | salary expectation]]?" during a job interview, how you respond is critical. Answering incorrectly or not at all can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This question is more complex than a simple direct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters ask about your [[salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | salary expectation]] to determine if it aligns with the company's established salary band for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This information is included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

It's generally not a trick question; recruiters genuinely want to know your expectations to ensure that if an offer is extended, you will accept it and be excited about the compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Accepting a salary below your expectations can lead to dissatisfaction and looking for other opportunities, which employers want to avoid to prevent needing to refill the position quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

While some low-quality employers might try to lowball offers, reputable employers aim for a mutually satisfactory agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. If your realistic [[salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | salary expectations]] deter a company, it might indicate they are not the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Scenarios in Salary Discussions

### When Your Salary Expectation is Higher Than the Range
If your expected salary is too high for the role, it can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Small Gap (e.g., $10,000 difference)**: There might be room for negotiation even before formal interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Recruiters might explore your flexibility or offer different compensation structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Large Gap (e.g., $25,000 difference)**: It's unlikely an employer can meet such a high expectation, and they may indicate that the expectations for the role differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They might keep you in mind for future, more senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidates**: For exceptionally talented candidates who are a perfect fit, a recruiter might still forward your resume with the higher [[salary expectations and negotiation in interviews | salary expectations]] to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In some cases, the hiring manager might decide to enrich the role, making it a higher-level position with a wider salary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, this is an exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

It's crucial to be honest about your expectations. Attempting a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### When Your Salary Expectation is Lower Than the Range
This is a favorable situation for both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. You'll likely receive a significant raise, and the company feels they are getting a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Major corporations use salary bands, which define minimum, midpoint, and maximum compensation based on local market wage surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. They also consider "internal equity," ensuring that employees in similar roles are compensated relatively the same to avoid disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If your expectation is below the lowest point of their range, your compensation will likely be automatically raised to that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

This scenario often occurs with candidates from less reputable or smaller companies that don't have the same robust salary structures, or when an individual is stepping into a higher-level role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Seeking high-quality employers can help ensure your salary remains competitive with market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Refusing to Answer the Question
Giving vague or evasive answers to the [[how to answer salary expectation questions in interviews | salary expectation question]] will almost always lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Recruiters need to know if a deal can be made before putting you through the full interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Refusal also makes recruiters suspect you are hiding something, casting doubt on your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Trying to be ambiguous and only [[salary negotiation strategies | negotiate]] at the offer stage rarely works out well, as hiring managers will be annoyed by wasted time if they cannot meet your hidden expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. If a recruiter senses frustration, it's best to provide an answer to avoid being put in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## [[How to prepare for salary discussions in interviews | Preparing to Answer Salary Questions]]

To effectively answer the [[understanding job expectations and compensation | salary expectation question]], you need to understand three key things:

1.  **Average Salary Range in the Open Market**: Research the average salary for similar roles in your local area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Utilize resources like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Ensure your comparison is realistic by focusing on jobs in your specific geographic area (e.g., Alabama vs. Bay Area salaries will differ significantly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **Company's Expected Pay**: While harder to ascertain directly, your research into market rates helps align with typical company pay.
3.  **Your Bottom-Line Salary Expectation**: Determine the absolute minimum salary you are willing to accept, knowing when you must walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This internal number doesn't necessarily need to be shared with the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## [[Strategies for handling salary discussions during job interviews | Strategies for Answering Salary Expectation Questions]]

Here are a few ways to approach the [[strategies for answering salary expectation questions | salary expectation question]]:

1.  **State Your Expectation Directly**: If you know your worth and are confident the company's range is similar, you can provide your specific number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Remember that this number will be used throughout the hiring process, so ensure it's reasonable and something you can commit to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
2.  **Frame it with Market Research**: If you suspect the company might offer a low salary or you are far above their expected range, put the onus back on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   Example: "From the research I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between $90,000 to $110,000. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> This prompts them to reveal if they are paying below market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Put the Question Back on the Recruiter**: If you are concerned about pricing yourself out of an opportunity you're interested in, or might be willing to take a lower salary for, try this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>:
    *   Example: "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within, and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
    *   A recruiter might respond with the compensation range for other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   Be prepared for the recruiter to push back and insist you answer first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>; you still need a prepared answer, but avoid avoiding the question entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

When considering a [[evaluating_counteroffers | counter offer]] from a current employer, it is generally advised to think twice about accepting it [00:00:23]. While a headhunter might not care if you accept a counter offer, a career coach prioritizes your best interest and has observed many circumstances where accepting a counter offer did not work out well [00:00:31].

## Real-Life Scenario: A Reddit Post Example

A person posted on Reddit about their experience with a counter offer after accepting a new job and putting in their notice [00:00:57]. This scenario helps solidify reasons why accepting a counter offer might not be the best course of action [00:01:08].

### The Initial Offer
The individual accepted a job offer from a non-competing company for similar work, but with expanded responsibilities, resulting in a 30% pay bump [00:01:26]. This significant pay increase suggests the person might have been underpaid or stayed in their previous role too long, highlighting the importance of occasionally checking the open market and even taking an interview or two to assess one's market value [00:01:39]. The new role also offered the benefit of expanding their experience, which would strengthen their resume [00:02:00]. The individual stated they had no intention of using this new offer to seek a [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_employers | counter offer]] [00:02:20], trusting their gut feeling that it was the best course of action [00:02:25].

### Current Employer's Reaction
Upon learning of the resignation, the current boss immediately asked how to keep the employee [00:02:40]. Suddenly, "big plans" for the employee surfaced, including hiring four to five new people to be placed on a team under them, which was presented by a boss two layers up [00:02:58]. This is a common tactic, referred to as the "proverbial carrot" dangled in front of employees, often causing people to stay in jobs longer than they should due to a constant promise of something just out of reach [00:03:15].

The employee recognized this manipulation, stating that "talk is cheap" and that plans with their current company materialize slowly [00:03:27]. They insisted that any counter offer would need to be in writing and accompanied by a solid pay bump [00:03:33].

## Why Current Employers Counter Offer
A company offering a counter offer after a resignation often indicates they were caught off guard and weren't prepared for the employee to leave, perhaps viewing them as a "steady Eddie" who wouldn't disrupt the status quo [00:03:53]. They might be taking the employee for granted or underpaying them [00:03:45]. The sudden offer of increased pay and responsibility when an employee has "one foot out the door" raises the question of why the recognition wasn't given before [00:08:49]. Often, employers are just trying to buy themselves time to find a replacement [00:09:06].

## Navigating Counter Offer Conversations
When current employers, especially high-level executives, approach you about a counter offer, you are in complete control [00:04:22].

### What to Disclose (or Not)
It is crucial to keep information about the new opportunity to yourself [00:04:47]. Do not disclose:
*   The salary or pay [00:04:48]
*   The name of the new company [00:04:51]
*   The job title [00:04:56]

This is to prevent the current employer from potentially interfering or "torpedoing" your new opportunity behind the scenes [00:04:58]. You should say nothing, hear them out, and let them present their offer [00:05:58]. A good response to why you are leaving is that you were "pulled by an opportunity" rather than leaving due to an issue with the current company [00:05:20]. If asked about the competitiveness of the offer, state it was "very competitive" but let them propose their terms [00:16:43].

### What to Expect from a Counter Offer
If a current employer offers a "ridiculous number" to get you to stay, consider the following documentation if you are sincere about [[evaluating_counteroffers | evaluating counteroffers]]:
*   A new job title [00:06:18] and level [00:06:50]
*   New responsibilities [00:06:23]
*   A detailed job description [00:06:25]
*   The pay range or grade [00:06:27]
*   All of the above documented in an official offer letter from the human resources department, not just your boss or their boss [00:06:33]

## [[risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | Risks of Accepting a Counter Offer]]
Accepting a counter offer carries several [[risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | risks]]:

*   **Becoming an "Expensive You"**: If you accept a counter offer without a new job title or level, you become a more expensive version of your current self [00:06:56]. This can make you a target in future layoffs, as you might be the most expensive person in your department [00:07:01].
*   **Flight Risk Label**: Your employer may now view you as a "Flight Risk" because you explored other options [00:07:09].
*   **Target on Your Back**: There will be a higher level of expectation, and any mistakes could be scrutinized, as the company is paying you more [00:07:27].
*   **Insincerity**: The sudden plans or promises for leadership roles after you resign are often insincere [00:16:23]. Companies that genuinely plan for your advancement would already have you on a succession planning program, providing development, mentorship, and clear career paths [00:12:09].
*   **Slow Career Advancement**: Promises of future leadership roles may take years to materialize, often only happening when someone retires or leaves [00:17:10].

## [[reasons_to_decline_a_counter_offer | Reasons to Decline a Counter Offer]]
The employee in the Reddit scenario ultimately decided not to accept the counter offer, providing a strong example of why [[reasons_to_decline_a_counter_offer | declining a counter offer]] is often the best choice [00:14:18].

Key observations from the case study that support declining:
*   **Management Out of Touch**: High-level executives offering counters may be out of touch with the reality of day-to-day operations two or three layers down [00:15:53].
*   **Vague Promises**: The company's promises of "opportunities" for new roles (e.g., Data Engineer) when they don't even have a job opening clearly defined are red flags for insincerity [00:16:16].
*   **Company-Centric View**: The employer's framing of the counter offer as "we can use you" rather than "we would like to help you grow your career" indicates they are primarily looking at their own needs, not yours [00:16:51].
*   **No Prior Recognition**: The fact that a significant pay bump and leadership plans only surfaced after the resignation highlights that the company did not recognize the employee's value until they were about to lose them [00:08:50].

## What to Say When Declining
If you have already accepted a new job offer, you are not obligated to start, even after signing an offer letter [00:07:59]. However, if you decide to honor your commitment to the new offer, which is generally advised, you can simply call the new recruiter and state that you won't be able to move forward with the offer after all, as you decided to stick with your current employer due to a counter offer [00:08:11]. While the recruiter might be upset temporarily, they will move on to other candidates [00:08:31]. You must act as the CEO of your own career and make the decision that is best for you [00:08:42].

## [[factors_influencing_decision_to_accept_a_counteroffer | Factors influencing decision to accept a counteroffer]]
While general advice leans against accepting counter offers, every situation is unique [00:18:21]. Trust your gut and intuition [00:18:28].

Consider the company's past behavior: their past performance is the best indicator of their future performance [00:13:12]. If they have treated you poorly or taken you for granted in the past, it is likely they will continue to do so [00:13:19]. The advantage of considering a counter offer from your current company is that you have a clear history of how they operate and treat employees [00:13:26].

## [[longterm_career_impact_of_accepting_counteroffers | Longterm career impact of accepting counteroffers]]
Regarding career advancement, companies with true leadership aspirations for an employee will typically have them on a succession planning program, which involves development, mentorship, special groups, and potentially even further education [00:12:09]. If you are not part of such a program, or if senior roles in your company are typically filled externally rather than internally, it's a strong indicator that the "leadership plans" offered during a counter offer might not be genuine [00:12:43].

## Conclusion
While some exceptions exist, the overwhelming evidence suggests that it is usually best to decline a counter offer from your current employer [00:18:15]. Focus on opportunities that recognize your value proactively and align with your [[negotiating_job_offers_and_career_advancement_strategies | career advancement strategies]].

Interviewing is a critical step in the job search process, and a key component of success for candidates is demonstrating genuine [[professionalism_and_engagement_in_interviews | engagement]] by actively asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. According to a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, hiring managers frequently express dissatisfaction when candidates fail to ask any questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Why Engagement Matters

The primary reason hiring managers dislike a lack of questions is that it "essentially shows a [[professionalism_and_engagement_in_interviews | lack of engagement]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For a candidate, asking questions during the interview process is crucial not only to satisfy the interviewer's expectation of curiosity but also for the candidate's own benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It demonstrates a genuine interest in the role and the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Interview as a Two-Way Street

Candidates should view the interview as a mutual screening process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It is not merely about the company interviewing the candidate, but also about the candidate interviewing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The best candidates in a recruiter's experience often give the impression that they are interviewing the hiring manager more than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This perspective encourages a "slightly more aggressive mindset" during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Benefits for the Candidate

Asking questions allows job seekers to:
*   **Screen the opportunity:** It's essential to be selective about job roles, as "one bad job could set you back years in your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Gather crucial information:** Questions help candidates determine if the role, department, and company align with their goals and if they can be set up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Identify potential red flags:** By asking targeted questions, candidates can uncover issues like unreasonable expectations or instability within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## How to Engage Effectively

While it's customary for interviewers to ask if a candidate has questions at the end, candidates should feel free to [[professionalism_and_engagement_in_interviews | engage]] the interviewer throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This transforms the interview into a "two-way dialogue," which is considered the best way to [[improving_job_interview_performance | ace that interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. When questions are asked, it makes the candidate sound [[professionalism_and_engagement_in_interviews | very engaged]] and provides an opportunity to learn valuable insights about the role before accepting an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

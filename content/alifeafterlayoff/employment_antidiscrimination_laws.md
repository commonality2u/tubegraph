When recruiting for roles based in the United States, even international companies must adhere to US laws and regulations concerning employment practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Employers that fail to comply with these laws, or ask inappropriate questions during the [[challenges_with_job_application_processes_and_employer_expectations | job application]] process, can be considered "red flag" employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Identifying Problematic Employers
Several indicators can suggest an employer is unprofessional, a scam, or violating legal employment practices:
*   A large corporation's HR department directly handling talent acquisition instead of a dedicated talent acquisition department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Requiring candidates to fill out manual forms outside of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or online application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Asking candidates to cash checks or pay for anything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Asking illegal questions during the application or interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Illegal Questions in Job Applications (U.S.)
Many questions commonly asked in some parts of the world are illegal under U.S. federal employment laws, primarily due to their potential for [[legal_options_when_facing_workplace_discrimination | discrimination]] against protected classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Candidates should be wary if asked any of the following:

### Marital Status
*   **Illegal Question**: "What is your civil or marital status?" including single, married, divorced, separated, or if one has a significant other, especially with requests for additional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Reason for Illegality**: Marital status has no bearing on an individual's ability to perform a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Family Status and Children
*   **Illegal Questions**: "Do you have any kids and if yes how many minors?" or "Do you have child care for your children during working hours?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Reason for Illegality**: Employers cannot [[legal_options_when_facing_workplace_discrimination | discriminate]] against individuals based on family status, parenthood, or pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Such questions are often used to predict perceived issues like increased time off for childcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Legal Alternative**: An employer should ask if a candidate can meet specific schedule requirements, rather than inquiring about their childcare arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Nationality and Country of Origin
*   **Illegal Questions**: "What passports do you hold and National nationality?" or "Country of birth or country of origin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Reason for Illegality**: Disclosing national origin is an illegal question in the United States, as it relates to a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Legal Alternative**: The appropriate question is "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Age
*   **Illegal Question**: Asking for a candidate's age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Reason for Illegality**: This question directly relates to [[agerelated_biases_and_discrimination_in_the_workplace | age-based discrimination]] or agism, which is prohibited in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Religion
*   **Illegal Question**: Inquiring about a candidate's religion, or if their religion has changed since birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Reason for Illegality**: Religion is a protected class, and employers cannot [[legal_options_when_facing_workplace_discrimination | discriminate]] based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Height and Weight
*   **Generally Illegal Question**: "What is your height and weight?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Reason for Illegality**: According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), height and weight requirements tend to disproportionately limit employment opportunities for some protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Unless directly related to a job requirement, such inquiries may be viewed as illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Many states and local municipalities specifically prohibit [[legal_options_when_facing_workplace_discrimination | discrimination]] based on height and weight unless it's an actual job requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Medical Conditions
*   **Illegal Questions**: "Do you have any medical conditions?" or requesting elaboration, mention of medications, medical history, or upcoming surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Reason for Illegality**: These are highly invasive and illegal questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, violating privacy and anti-discrimination laws regarding disability.

When encountering such questions, job seekers should recognize these as significant red flags and consider avoiding the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

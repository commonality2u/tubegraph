The employment market has seen significant shifts over the past few years, moving through various trends such as the [[understanding_the_great_resignation|Great Resignation]], [[concept_of_quiet_quitting_in_the_workforce|quiet quitting]], and [[employer_reactions_and_quiet_firing|quiet firing]], leading up to the latest concept of career cushioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding these trends requires a look back at the forces that shaped them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Background: The 2020 Economic Downturn

In 2020, a major economic downturn occurred due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Many employers reacted by laying off employees, potentially unnecessarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This created a ripple effect where remaining employees were burdened with additional work, leading to stress, long hours, and a prevailing attitude of "you should just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Employers sought to maximize output while cutting expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This period caused widespread burnout and prompted individuals to reevaluate their life and career priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## [[understanding_the_great_resignation|The Great Resignation]]

The reevaluation of priorities led to the [[understanding_the_great_resignation|Great Resignation]] wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This marked a significant shift where the balance of power, which had long favored employers, swung towards employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. As people resigned en masse, industries struggled with a disengaged workforce and a lack of personnel to meet product and service demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This period was a "heyday of job seeking," characterized by abundant opportunities, frequent raises, and widespread job hopping for better pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Some individuals, comfortable in stable roles, took risks to pursue these lucrative new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## [[concept_of_quiet_quitting_in_the_workforce|Quiet Quitting]]

For those who chose not to leave their jobs during the boom, [[concept_of_quiet_quitting_in_the_workforce|quiet quitting]] emerged as an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Burned out but unwilling to resign, employees realized that the risk of reduced effort was minimal due to the abundance of job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## [[employer_reactions_and_quiet_firing|Quiet Firing]]

As the job market's pendulum began to swing back towards neutrality, employers started to regain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Hiring slowed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This gave rise to the concept of [[employer_reactions_and_quiet_firing|quiet firing]], where employers subtly encourage employees to quit rather than outright terminating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Current [[current_economic_trends_and_job_hopping|Economic Trends]] and the Job Market

As of December 2022, the job market remains shaky and is trending towards uncertainty, with the pendulum appearing to swing more towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While the overall labor market still shows signs of strength, specific sectors, especially the [[job_market_trends_and_the_tech_industry|tech industry]], have been hit hard by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. There are indicators that this trend could spread to other parts of the economy in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives revealed concerning [[job_market_trends_and_misleading_job_statistics|talent outlooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Despite concerns about hiring and retaining talent, 50% of respondents were reducing their overall headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This indicates that companies are "right-sizing" after potentially over-hiring during the previous boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Evidence includes widespread layoffs in major tech companies, hiring freezes, and a reduction or elimination of sign-on bonuses and perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Furthermore, 44% of companies are rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Career Cushioning: The Latest Trend

All these shifts have led to the emergence of "career cushioning," which advocates for proactively planning to mitigate the possibility of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This is seen as a safety net, akin to having backup options in dating before a breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### How to Practice Career Cushioning

Career cushioning involves several proactive measures:
*   **Updating your professional profile:** This includes ensuring your LinkedIn profile is optimized and current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Refreshing your resume:** Keep your resume up-to-date to avoid scrambling if you receive a layoff notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Market Research:** Regularly review job postings to understand current employer demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Active Networking:** Build and maintain active professional networks, connecting with the right people who could assist you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Soft Applications:** Begin applying to jobs or reaching out to recruiters for "soft feelers" to gauge the market, even if not actively job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Career Self-Assessment:** Take a collective look at your career aspirations, evaluate your current skill set, identify any gaps, and create a plan to achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This proactive planning while employed reduces stress during an active job search and helps eliminate positions that don't align with your core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Career cushioning is not a new concept, but rather a formalized label for proactive career management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Individuals should consistently implement these steps to be prepared for any "hiccups" in their career path, rather than falling into "huge craters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. It is strongly advised to practice career cushioning by acting like a "free agent," taking proactive steps to protect oneself from unplanned income disruption, and taking control of one's career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

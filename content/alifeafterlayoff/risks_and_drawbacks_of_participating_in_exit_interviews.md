An exit interview is a meeting requested by Human Resources after an employee has tendered their resignation [00:00:00] [00:00:03]. It is conducted by an HR representative, potentially a manager, mid-level, or even entry-level staff, who goes through a standard form of questions [02:24:00] [02:34:00]. These questions typically cover why the employee decided to leave, their new position, feedback on the company, satisfaction with their boss, and whether they would consider returning in the future [02:36:00] [02:49:00] [02:52:00]. The information collected is then stored, either in the employee's file or a generic HR file [03:03:00]. Larger organizations may even use third-party companies to conduct these interviews and compile reports [03:18:00] [03:22:00].

## Purpose of Exit Interviews

Organizations conduct exit interviews primarily to collect data on overall trends within their workforce that relate to the market [01:09:00] [01:13:00]. This data can help identify issues such as uncompetitive compensation or benefit concerns [01:16:00] [01:19:00] [01:22:00]. The goal is to spot employment trends and put together corrective actions if deemed necessary [01:27:00] [01:30:00].

Companies are particularly concerned with voluntary turnover and aim to understand if there is a larger problem at hand [01:42:00] [01:46:00]. They may also use the data to identify specific managers who have abnormally high turnover rates, prompting further investigation into their management style or the need for retraining [01:49:00] [01:52:00] [01:59:00] [02:01:00]. Generally, the intention behind exit interviews is to collect data, not to be malicious [02:07:00] [02:09:00].

## Should You Participate?

Generally, it is not recommended to participate in an exit interview [03:36:00] [03:38:00].

### It is Not Required
Companies cannot force an employee to participate in an exit interview [03:41:00] [03:43:00]. They cannot withhold paychecks or take any adverse action against an employee for declining to participate [03:45:00] [03:49:00]. Participation is strictly voluntary [03:51:00].

### Potential Risks and Drawbacks
While there is little to gain for the employee, there is a potential for loss [03:57:00] [04:01:00] [04:03:00].

*   **Burning Bridges:** Using the exit interview as an opportunity to vent frustrations about issues like a difficult boss, lack of promotional opportunities, underpayment, or a toxic work environment can create a document of gripes [04:05:00] [04:08:00] [04:11:00] [04:13:00] [04:15:00] [04:17:00] [04:19:00] [04:30:00]. This documentation becomes associated with the employee's employment file [04:40:00] [04:42:00].
*   **Impact on Future Re-employment:** If an employee decides to seek re-employment with that organization in the future, these negative records can be referenced [04:43:00] [04:45:00] [04:46:00]. Having a list of grievances and a negative exit record can jeopardize being rehired, potentially placing the employee in a "not hirable" category [04:54:00] [04:55:00] [04:58:00] [05:12:00] [05:13:00] [05:21:00] [05:24:00].
*   **Limited Impact of Feedback:** The HR representative conducting the interview typically has little decision-making power and may be paid less than the departing employee [06:29:00] [06:31:00] [06:33:00] [06:36:00]. While the hope is that the information reaches decision-makers for change, it often falls on deaf ears, only providing momentary satisfaction to the employee [06:39:00] [06:40:00] [06:42:00] [06:43:00] [06:45:00] [06:50:00] [06:51:00].
*   **Legal Implications for Reference Checks:** While the exit interview creates a record with the former employer, it is unlikely to be shared with new employers during reference checks [05:29:00] [05:31:00]. Companies typically avoid discussing the details of an employee's exit during reference checks to prevent potential legal liability, such as a lawsuit [05:51:00] [05:57:00] [06:01:00] [06:04:00] [06:06:00] [06:08:00] [06:09:00] [06:11:00] [06:13:00].

### When Participation Might Be Considered
If an employee is 100% certain they will never return to that employer in the future and truly wish to express their feelings, the exit interview might be their only real opportunity to do so [06:15:00] [06:16:00] [06:18:00] [06:19:00] [06:22:00] [06:23:00] [06:26:00] [06:28:00].

Ultimately, if an employee is leaving due to valid internal issues, their manager should already be aware of these problems through regular one-on-one discussions [06:55:00] [06:57:00] [06:58:00] [07:03:00] [07:04:00] [07:06:00] [07:07:00]. If the departure comes as a surprise to the manager despite underlying departmental issues, it reflects poorly on the manager's awareness [07:11:00] [07:13:00] [07:15:00] [07:16:00] [07:18:00].

The "Great Resignation" describes a significant wave of people voluntarily leaving their jobs en masse, a phenomenon gripping the global workforce since the events of the last 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This trend is a legitimate phenomenon, with a surprising majority of employed individuals considering making a job change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

According to Microsoft's research, up to 41% of currently working individuals planned to leave their jobs within the subsequent year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The U.S. Labor Department reported a record four million people quit their jobs voluntarily in April 2021, marking the commencement of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This significant movement occurred during a period of considerable uncertainty in the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Drivers of the Great Resignation

The primary reason for this mass exodus is that people began to perceive their lives differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
Key factors include:

### Re-evaluation of Commute and Office Life
Many realized how much time was spent commuting and in an office setting, leading to the conclusion that it might not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Historically, remote work carried a stigma, suggesting remote employees were less dedicated or not part of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. However, many individuals working remotely often work more hours than those in an office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The transition to remote work for many companies was forced by circumstances, revealing that a significant number of positions could be performed remotely, especially white-collar or professional-level jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Increased Workload and Burnout
Many companies overcorrected in 2020 by cutting positions too deeply, anticipating a greater impact on their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. As the market rebounded faster than expected, remaining employees experienced a significant shift of extra work onto them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This overload, combined with constant digital meetings, led to widespread exhaustion and digital burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Changing Employee Priorities
The forced adaptation to different work models led many to recalibrate and question the traditional work model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Employees became less willing to work 60-70 hours per week and are seeking [[current_trends_in_job_hopping | faster career progression]] and dissatisfaction with antiquated business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Many are making complete 180-degree turns in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Impact on Recruitment and Companies

The current job market often presents a "buyer's market" for employees, particularly at the hourly and, to some extent, professional levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Companies that are rigid in their philosophy regarding return-to-office and remote work are expected to struggle with [[improving_recruitment_processes | recruitment]] and competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### The Rise of "Employment Experience"
The post-pandemic era is increasingly defined by "employment experience," which encompasses how an organization shapes the way people work and live, including productivity, flexibility, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. To remain competitive in the labor market, companies must offer not only financial benefits but also work-life balance and remote work flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

For recruiters, questions about blended or hybrid opportunities and work-life balance are now much more frequent concerns among candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Companies with [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | resistant hiring managers]] that fail to adapt to these demands will face a competitive disadvantage in [[recruitment_strategies_and_candidate_profiles | the recruitment market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Challenges for Companies
The current market has a high number of open positions and fewer people to fill them, largely due to people quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Some companies are still pushing for employees to return to the office without valid business reasons, which may hinder their long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Additionally, the practice of adjusting pay based on geographic location for remote workers, even if they perform the same job, is seen as punitive and illogical, especially when companies can save on office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Great Resignation reflects a significant recalibration of priorities for individuals in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This shift will compel companies to adapt, which can only be a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The trends indicate that employers must embrace flexibility, fair compensation regardless of location, meaningful career paths, and prioritize [[candidate_experience_and_job_market_challenges | employee well-being]] and work-life balance to attract and retain talent in the evolving [[job_market_trends_postpandemic | job market]]. These [[issues_with_the_current_job_market_and_hiring_practices | issues with current hiring practices]] are driving a profound change in the [[the_role_of_recruitment_and_layoffs | role of recruitment]].

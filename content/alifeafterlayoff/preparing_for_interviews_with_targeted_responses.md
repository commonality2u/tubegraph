When preparing for interviews, one of the most frequently feared questions by job seekers is, "Why should we hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers ask this question to understand if a candidate grasps the position's purpose and how they can contribute to solving a specific business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises against generic responses and instead recommends a targeted, three-part strategy to answer effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Understanding the Interviewer's Perspective

A new position is typically created within a department to address a business gap or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This could be to replace a departing employee, or to meet a new business need, leading to the creation of a new headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This problem-solving intention forms the basis of the job requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Recruiters work closely with hiring managers, conducting an "intake call" to review job specifications and identify critical skills needed for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This process helps create an "ideal candidate profile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, which details the business problem the new hire is expected to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Understanding this underlying problem is key to answering the "Why should we hire you?" question effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Who Asks This Question?
While a recruiter might screen candidates, the "Why should we hire you?" question is most likely to come from the hiring manager during their interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Targeted Response Strategy for "Why Should We Hire You?"

A successful response involves a three-part formula:

### 1. Understand the Business Problem
The first step is to understand why the position is open and what specific business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For example, a company might be launching a new project, a new division, or lack the bandwidth or specific skill set within their current team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

To uncover this information:
*   **Study the Job Description:** Pay close attention to the job description, highlighting major points that indicate the business's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Listen to the Recruiter:** During preliminary screenings, ask questions and listen carefully to what the recruiter says about the role and company, as they often provide key insights into the business's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is part of [[preparing_questions_for_interviewers | preparing questions for interviewers]].

### 2. Link Your Past Experiences to the Problem
Once you know the business problem, connect your previous experiences directly to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Frame your answer by demonstrating how you have already solved similar problems in past roles, proving your track record of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This direct alignment makes you a more compelling candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This is a [[key_elements_of_a_successful_interview_response | key element of a successful interview response]].

### 3. Demonstrate How You Would Solve Their Problem
The final step is to explain how you would apply your experience to solve the company's specific problem in the new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Offer concrete examples or strategies, such as "I've worked on this type of project before, and this is how I would solve it: I would do this, this, and this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This helps the interviewer visualize you in the role and performing the necessary tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Avoid Generic Responses

Many job seekers make the mistake of giving generic, "fluffy" answers that do not provide specific value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Examples of generic statements to avoid include:
*   "I'm a team player." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> (Note: this is physically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.)
*   "I'm a fast learner." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   "I achieve results." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'll jump into your team and hit the ground running." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

These phrases are common and do not differentiate you from other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Instead, focus on tying the business results you've achieved in the past to the current business problem they are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This focused approach is a key part of [[strategies_for_answering_common_interview_questions | strategies for answering common interview questions]].

By following these steps, you can provide a targeted and impactful answer to "Why should we hire you?", demonstrating your understanding of the role and your ability to deliver solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

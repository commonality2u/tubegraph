Blacklisting refers to a situation where an individual is unofficially barred from being hired by a company, often a former employer, despite being qualified for a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon is a real practice, with companies like Meta confirming they maintain "block lists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Meta's Block Lists and "Do Not Hire" Designations

A Business Insider expose revealed that former Meta employees found themselves blocked from rehire, placed on a [[do_not_hire_lists_and_blacklisting_in_companies | "do not hire" list]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The article, titled "Meta keeps block lists of ex-employees and even help from a VP can't get you off of it," confirmed long-held suspicions about such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

One senior engineer, caught in Meta's massive 2022 layoffs (which involved over 10,000 people), experienced this firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These layoffs were initially stated as non-performance-based and impacted certain business groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Many of those laid off, including this engineer, had "exceeded expectations" in performance reviews and had received promotions and praise for their critical contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite being told their layoff was "simply a business decision" and that multiple hiring managers wanted them back, they found themselves [[do_not_hire_lists_and_blacklisting_in_companies | blacklisted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

After applying for nearly 20 positions at Meta over a year, the engineer noticed a pattern: hiring managers would express interest, set up screening calls with recruiters, but then Meta's internal recruiters would [[reasons_for_employment_ghosting | ghost them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Eventually, a hiring manager learned the recruiting team had forbidden contact because the engineer was "deemed ineligible for rehire," or "scarlet lettered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Meta uses multiple internal systems to track rehire ineligibility, including a "non-regrettable attrition" designation and a "do not hire" flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Most companies do track this information within their HRIS (Human Resources Information System), where employment data is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Recruiters often contact the HR department to conduct due diligence on former employees seeking rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Meta later shifted its layoff strategy, making future layoffs performance-based, which could further "scarlet letter" those previously laid off as "poor performers" in the eyes of other Silicon Valley hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## How Employees Discover Blacklisting

It is generally not possible to directly ask a company if one is on a blacklist, as they will not disclose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Common ways employees find out include:
*   **Persistent Rejections**: Continuously applying and being rejected without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Recruiters**: External recruiters may be contacted by the company after submitting a candidate, informing them that the individual is on a "do not hire" list, which the recruiter then conveys to the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## [[Ways employees can be blacklisted | Ways Employees Can Be Blacklisted]]

There are several ways an individual can end up on a company's blacklist:
*   **Policy Violations**: Stealing confidential information or other severe breaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Underperformance**: Being an underperformer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Managerial Discretion**: Managers may have broad discretion to add names to the list without documented performance issues, such as if an employee "pissed off" a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. A former manager stated it was "not hard to put somebody on this list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Circumstances of Separation**:
    *   **Rage Quitting**: Quitting abruptly, "kicking over the planter," or leaving without notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   **Involuntary Resignation**: Even if the employee did everything right, this could lead to blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   **Voluntary Separation**: Depending on the circumstances and how the manager marks the attrition (e.g., "non-regrettable attrition"), an employee could be blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Performance Signals**: Last performance ratings prior to separation and any other performance signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Once an employee is marked as "non-regrettable" or blacklisted, this status is typically "tattooed into your employment file" and follows the individual permanently, even if the managers or colleagues involved have left the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Functional Impact of Blacklisting

When a blacklisted candidate engages with a recruiter, initial communications may be smooth and enthusiastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. However, once the candidate's history with the company is reviewed at a deeper level, things slow down significantly, communication gaps lengthen, answers become vague, and the candidate eventually receives a random rejection letter without clear reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Blacklisting Without Previous Employment

It is also possible to be informally blacklisted by a company even if one has never worked there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Excessive Applications**: Applying for the same job repeatedly or for many different, often unrelated, jobs within the same company can create a bias against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Staffing teams and hiring managers may see extensive application activity and assume there's a reason why the candidate hasn't been hired by other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Interview Process Dispositions**: Companies like Amazon might assign a disposition status to candidates who go through interview processes (known as "loops") but are not successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   For technical skill deficiencies, a "recycle period" (e.g., 6 months) might allow the candidate to reapply after improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
    *   However, if removed from the process for failing "leadership principles" (behavior-based interviews), there was often "no recycling," effectively banning the candidate permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Backdoor References

A "backdoor reference" is another way an individual can be blacklisted from opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This occurs when someone on a hiring team contacts an acquaintance who worked at a candidate's previous company to ask for their unofficial opinion on the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. These references can sink a candidate's chances and lead to blacklisting, and they happen covertly, so the candidate is unlikely to know about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This is especially prevalent in small industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Outlook

While some employers actively use "do not hire" lists, this is not believed to be a widespread practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. If an individual is blacklisted by one company, particularly a large tech firm like Meta, it is important to remember that there are many other employers available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The focus should be on reclaiming control over one's career and building it with "high conviction and authority," rather than dwelling on the policies of a single employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

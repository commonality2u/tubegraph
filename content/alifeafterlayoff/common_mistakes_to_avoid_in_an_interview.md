Landing a job interview is a significant step, but navigating the interview process can be as challenging as traversing a minefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Often, what you say—or don't say—can be the deciding factor in whether you're moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. A corporate recruiter shares ten things you should never say in an interview if you're serious about getting the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## [[Red flags in job interviews | Red Flags in Job Interviews]]: Things to Never Say or Do

### 1. Asking "What Does the Company Do?"

This question immediately signals that you are unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Before any interview, candidates are expected to conduct basic research on the company, including:
*   Its core business and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Major divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Key competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Any new technologies or initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Showing a lack of basic knowledge makes it hard to convince the interviewer of your genuine interest in the company's mission, vision, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It's also advisable to research the company's core value statement to ensure alignment with your personal values, which can prevent future cultural mismatches and potential turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### 2. Asking "What Is This Role?"

While an interviewer will provide some details about the position, you are expected to have thoroughly read the job description and have a good understanding of the role's objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Asking about the basic function of the role suggests a lack of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Companies seek problem-solvers, not individuals who need constant guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### 3. Asking "What Are the Hours?"

For professional-level, salaried, non-exempt positions, asking about specific work hours is generally frowned upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It can give the impression that you are a "clock-watcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Instead of directly asking about hours, try rephrasing your concerns to inquire about:
*   The company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Expectations for the first 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   The shift you might support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### 4. Asking About Promotional Opportunities Too Early

While it's reasonable to consider your career path, immediately inquiring about when you might advance to a management position suggests disinterest in the role you're currently interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

<div class="callout">
[!INFO] Better Approach
Instead, ask about general "career paths" or "potential long-term growth opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Frame the question to show excitement for the current position and a desire to learn about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
</div>

### 5. Asking About Salary

Bringing up salary at the very beginning of an interview is a significant turn-off for employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It suggests your motivation is primarily monetary before you even understand the position's full scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Allow the recruiter to initiate discussions about compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If you're in a second-round interview, salary has likely already been discussed with the recruiter, so avoid re-asking the hiring manager, as they rarely have the final say on pay ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### 6. Not Answering Salary Expectation Questions

Conversely, when asked about your salary expectations, you must provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Hesitating or stating you don't know the market rate shows you are unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. You should have a clear number in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Avoiding the question or trying to defer it will likely prevent you from advancing to the next interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### 7. Talking Poorly About Previous Employers or Bosses

While tempting, bad-mouthing a former company or boss is a major [[information_to_avoid_revealing_in_a_job_interview | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Interviewers are focused on whether you're a good fit for their company and role, not on your past grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This behavior is seen as unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

<div class="callout">
[!INFO] Pro-Tip
Instead, be gracious, demonstrate what you learned from previous experiences, and show genuine interest in the current opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
</div>

### 8. Saying You Are Nervous

It's understandable to feel nervous during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, especially if unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. While some leniency might be given by a recruiter initially, you are expected to take ownership of the interview and exude confidence in your abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Excessive nervousness can hinder your chances, particularly at the hiring manager level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Being well-prepared is the best way to manage nerves and effectively sell yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### 9. Being Too Casual

While a relaxed demeanor can help break the ice, being overly casual or using inappropriate language can offend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Avoid treating the interviewer like a personal friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Be cautious with first names, generally defaulting to how they introduce themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Never use terms like "boss" or "bro," as these are considered derogatory in a professional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Maintain a polished and professional approach to make a favorable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### 10. Not Asking Questions

At the end of an interview, you will almost certainly be asked if you have any questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Not having a list of well-thought-out, intelligent questions about the company, culture, or your fit for the organization indicates a lack of interest or awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Always come prepared with questions to show you are engaged in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Being prepared is key to staying ahead of the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

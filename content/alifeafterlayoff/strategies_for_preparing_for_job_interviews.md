One of the most feared questions interviewers face is "Why should we hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience explains exactly what recruiters are looking for when asking this question, providing [[effective_interview_tactics_for_job_seekers|effective interview tactics for job seekers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Understanding the "Why Should We Hire You?" Question

When a recruiter asks "Why should we hire you?", they are trying to gauge if the job seeker understands what the company is trying to accomplish with the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It's crucial to understand why the position is open and why the company needs to fill it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The question is not generic; it has a targeted reason behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The Hiring Manager's Perspective

From a hiring manager's perspective, a new position is typically created to solve a business gap or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This could be due to replacing an employee, or a new business need requiring a new headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This problem leads to the creation of a business case, which generates a job requisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Before recruiting begins, recruiters conduct an "intake call" with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. During this call, they review job specifications, identify critical tasks for the position, and determine the skills needed for a candidate to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This conversation helps the recruiter create an ideal candidate profile, which defines the business problem the role aims to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Understanding this business problem is key to effectively answering why you should be hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## A Three-Part Formula for Answering "Why Should We Hire You?"

A three-part formula is suggested for answering this question effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This formula is a key component of [[strategies_for_effective_job_search_and_interviews|strategies for effective job search and interviews]].

### 1. Understand Why the Position is Open

The first part of the formula is understanding the business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. You need to understand how you would fit into solving that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For example, a company might need someone for a new project, a new skill set, or because they are launching a new division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

To find out what the business is looking for, pay close attention to the job description, highlighting major points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. During your preliminary screen with a recruiter, listen closely to what they say, as they will provide key insights you can use in later interviews with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### 2. Link Your Past Experiences to the Business Problem

Once you understand the business problem, link your past experiences to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If the position involves a specific program or project, ideally, you have relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Frame your answer by explaining how you've already solved similar problems in previous organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This demonstrates a track record of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 3. Show How You Can Solve Their Problem

The final part is to demonstrate how you can apply your experience to solve the current company's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. You can even provide specific examples: "I've worked on this type of project before; this is how I would solve it, I would do this, this, and this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This helps the interviewer visualize you in the role, successfully tackling the challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Mistakes to Avoid: Generic Answers

Many job seekers make the mistake of giving generic answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Common generic responses include:
*   "I'm a team player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%" (which is physically impossible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   "I'm a fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   "I achieve results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'll jump into your team and hit the ground running" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

These types of statements are too generic and don't provide specific information about the candidate's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. What differentiates you is your ability to tie business results you've achieved in the past directly to solving the interviewer's specific business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

By following this formula, you can link your past successes to the company's current needs, significantly improving your chances of hitting the answer "out of the park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

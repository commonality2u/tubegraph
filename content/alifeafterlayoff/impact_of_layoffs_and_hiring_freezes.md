The current job market presents significant challenges for job seekers, making it notably harder to find employment compared to a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This period is considered one of the more challenging labor markets experienced in recent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The job market has undergone significant changes in the last 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Great Resignation
For many job seekers, their last job search might have been during the "Great Resignation" era, approximately 18 months ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. During that time, employers were offering high salaries to attract talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. However, some of these individuals who received large salaries subsequently found themselves impacted by [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoffs]], partly due to those higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Shifting Employment Pendulum
There's an "employment pendulum" that dictates where power resides in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Last year, the power was largely with the employee, allowing them to dictate terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, this pendulum is now swinging back, with employers regaining more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Impact of Layoffs and Increased Competition
Employers are slowing down their hiring processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. A significant factor is the widespread [[the_impact_of_economic_cycles_and_layoffs | layoffs]] that have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, which are unfortunately expected to continue into the second half of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. While many [[impact_of_layoffs_on_tech_job_market | layoffs]] have been concentrated in the tech sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, there's concern they may expand beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The consequence of these [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | layoffs]] is a significant increase in competition in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Certain roles have been hit harder, particularly within tech, including product managers, software developers, and recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Recruiters, in particular, experienced a very short-lived boom before being heavily impacted, often being the "last one's hired, first one's fired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This has resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of applicants for roles that previously struggled to find enough candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, making it a frustrating time for job seekers in these verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Hiring Freezes and Cautious Decision-Making
Companies are implementing hiring freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Many job openings are put on hold or paused mid-process as companies re-evaluate their hiring decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. There's an alarming increase in instances where job offers are rescinded just before a start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Employers are making slower, more carefully planned, and cautious hiring decisions, partly due to uncertainty about the market and a potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. They are reluctant to add expensive new costs like high salaries when the economic outlook is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Deterioration of the Hiring Process

### Reduced Recruiting Capacity
With many recruiters being laid off, the burden of hiring has shifted to hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. These managers often have reduced teams, the same amount of work, and are not trained for recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This leads to slower hiring processes and poorer overall recruitment experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Key aspects like smooth scheduling, quick movement through processes, and interview feedback are now much harder to come by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Influence of AI
The rapid emergence of AI in the workforce is also impacting hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Companies are evaluating how AI can affect their workforce and are actively exploring replacing workers with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. An AI "robot" is seen as a cheaper alternative that can work 24 hours a day and potentially output significantly more than a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This contributes to employers pausing hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

In recruiting specifically, companies are automating more processes due to the [[organizational_and_morale_impacts_of_layoffs | layoff]] of recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Job seekers are increasingly interacting with AI during the application process, leading to a more impersonal experience and potentially more rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. AI systems apply black-and-white filtering, making it difficult for candidates who are trying to pivot industries or job types and require a human interpretation of their skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:01]</a>. AI is also making its way into the interview process, with job seekers potentially interviewing with robots or participating in one-way video interviews where an AI system may screen for keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

### Return to Office Mandates
Companies are increasingly forcing a return to the office, creating a "war on the remote worker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. While a hybrid work model might be a win for some, fully remote work may be drastically cut down or ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This disadvantages job seekers who moved to areas with fewer local opportunities, relying on remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. A shift to hybrid or in-office models can necessitate significant lifestyle changes or even relocation for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Consequences for Job Seekers
Overall, there are fewer "decent" jobs available, and more people are looking for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. On average, it takes longer to find a job in the current market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. A LinkedIn study found that the average job seeker is applying to 40% more jobs today than a year ago, with less success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This challenging environment can be very frustrating and disheartening, especially for those impacted by [[impact_of_economic_downturns_and_layoffs | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Job Seekers
To navigate this difficult market, individuals who are currently employed are encouraged to take steps to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Job seekers need to adopt an authoritative approach and present themselves with more strength to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Key strategies include:

*   **Effective Resume Writing**: A well-crafted resume can help candidates bypass the competition and significantly improve their chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Strong Interviewing Skills**: With more qualified candidates vying for positions, expert negotiation and a firm strategy for each interview round are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Recruiter Outreach**: Optimizing one's professional presence, such as on LinkedIn, to attract recruiters can allow job seekers to bypass traditional application processes and directly connect with hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

In this competitive environment, having a competitive advantage and the necessary tools is essential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

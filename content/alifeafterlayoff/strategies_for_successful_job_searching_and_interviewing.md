To advance in your career, it's beneficial to adopt a "selfish" approach, prioritizing your own best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means acting like a "free agent" or the "CEO of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Current Labor Market Landscape

The concept of acting selfishly is particularly relevant due to the significant softening of the labor market over the past 6 to 8 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Widespread layoffs are occurring, particularly in the tech industry, and are expected to continue spilling over into other sectors throughout 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Companies have shown a lack of accountability and dignity in how they treat employees and handle layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Examples of unprofessional layoff practices include:
*   A Google employee being locked out of the office via a deactivated badge upon arrival, discovering their layoff this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Employees being notified of layoffs while in the middle of business trips, stranded away from home without a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   A person being laid off while in labor about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   An individual recruited away to Google only to be laid off after 13 weeks, derailing their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Companies like Zillow laying off recruiting staff in late 2022 and then reposting the same jobs shortly after, demonstrating poor forecasting and lack of loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

This behavior highlights that corporate loyalty is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>; the days of working for decades at one company for a pension are gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Employees are often viewed as "human resources" or numbers on a spreadsheet, useful only as long as they serve a purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_career_development_and_job_searching | Strategies for Career Development and Job Searching]]

Given the current climate, it's crucial to always make the best decision for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This means prioritizing your own career goals and financial well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Holding Companies Accountable
*   **Choose Wisely**: When interviewing, assess how companies behaved during the 2020 economic downturn and their current practices. Do not accept offers from companies that have shown poor behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Job Search & Interviewing Strategies
To get a leg up in a competitive market, consider these [[effective_job_search_strategies | strategies for job seekers to improve visibility and competitiveness]]:
*   **Resume Optimization**: A strong resume is essential for recruiters to notice you for a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Resources like "Resume Rocket Fuel" can help you craft an effective resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Interview Training**: Once you land an interview, it's up to you to sell yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Courses like "The Ultimate Job Seeker Bootcamp" provide interview training to guide you through major corporations' hiring processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Leverage LinkedIn**: The most [[strategies_for_selfmarketing_and_job_hunting_success | effective communication techniques for job interviews]] to get hired is often to have recruiters find you, bypassing hundreds of applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
    *   **Discoverability**: Set up your LinkedIn profile correctly to be easily discoverable by recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Recruiters actively use LinkedIn for candidate searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
    *   **Networking**: Build powerful networks on LinkedIn to potentially skip the traditional recruiting process and jump to the front of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The course "Unlocking LinkedIn" can guide you on setting up your profile and networking effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Ask the Right Questions**: During interviews, ask questions that ensure the company aligns with your values and has behaved properly in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Be a Free Agent
Always act like a free agent and make decisions that are in your best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. If a better opportunity arises, even shortly after starting a new job, consider taking it. A personal anecdote highlights this: an individual who was laid off received multiple offers, accepted one, but continued interviewing and received an even stronger offer, resulting in nearly a $100,000 raise from their original salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. You don't owe your employer anything more than an honest day's work for honest pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

To advance your career, it is beneficial to adopt a mindset of "selfishness" by always looking out for your own best interests first [00:00:00]. This approach, often referred to as acting like a "free agent" or the "CEO of your career," is particularly relevant in a softening labor market where companies frequently lay off employees without accountability [00:01:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Corporate loyalty is largely a thing of the past, with fewer people working at the same company for decades [00:07:34]. Companies view employees as "human resources" or numbers on a spreadsheet, eliminating positions once they are no longer deemed useful [00:10:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Key Principles for Job Seekers

### Prioritize Your Own Interests
Always make decisions that are best for you and your career goals [00:07:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. You owe your employer nothing more than an honest day's work for an honest day's pay [00:10:36].

> [!EXAMPLE] Leveraging Multiple Offers
> A job seeker, laid off in November, promptly updated their resume and LinkedIn profile, and learned [[strategies_for_effective_job_search_and_interviews | effective networking strategies]] to bypass recruiters [00:08:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This resulted in multiple job offers, including one with a significant pay increase [00:08:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Even after accepting an offer and starting a new job, they continued with final interviews for another company [00:09:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This led to an even stronger offer, demonstrating the importance of always considering the best opportunity available, even if it means leaving a recently started position [00:09:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Hold Companies Accountable
When interviewing, assess how companies have behaved in the past and present, especially regarding layoffs and employee treatment [00:06:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Choose to work for organizations that align with your values and have a history of proper conduct [00:06:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Questioning Company Behavior
> Companies have been known to handle layoffs in unprofessional ways, such as denying badge access to employees arriving at the office or notifying individuals while on business trips or in labor [00:02:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Some companies have laid off staff only to post the same jobs shortly after, without attempting to rehire those previously let go [00:06:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Job seekers should consider this behavior when deciding where to work [00:06:10].

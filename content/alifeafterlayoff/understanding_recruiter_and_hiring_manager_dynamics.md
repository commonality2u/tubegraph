Recruiters and hiring managers often work in tandem during the hiring process, but their individual perspectives and responsibilities can create distinct dynamics that impact a candidate's journey.

## Recruiter's Role in Advocating for Candidates
A recruiter may be impressed with a candidate and believe they "check all the boxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. In such cases, the recruiter will advocate for the candidate to the hiring manager, presenting their information and explaining why they should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Challenges Faced by Recruiters
Despite a recruiter's advocacy, a [[the_role_of_recruiters_and_hiring_managers_in_setting_job_criteria | hiring manager]] can still eliminate a candidate at this stage, sometimes based on their resume or interview notes, before the candidate even has a chance to speak with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This can be frustrating for the recruiter, as it can be difficult to convince a hiring manager with specific biases or arbitrary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Therefore, a rejection does not always mean the recruiter failed to submit the candidate or that the candidate wasn't considered by the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Impact of Hiring Manager Responsiveness
Long delays in receiving feedback are often due to unresponsive [[the_role_of_recruiters_and_hiring_managers_in_setting_job_criteria | hiring managers]], rather than the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Recruiters share the frustration of candidates in these situations because they are motivated to fill positions quickly and are graded on their speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. When a [[the_role_of_recruiters_and_hiring_managers_in_setting_job_criteria | hiring manager]] is unresponsive, there is little a recruiter can do beyond persistently prompting them for a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Interpreting Delays
A prolonged delay after interviews is generally not a positive sign, indicating that the company may be interviewing other candidates or is undecided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. If a candidate has not convinced the [[the_role_of_recruiters_and_hiring_managers_in_setting_job_criteria | hiring manager]] and interview panel that they are the best fit, delays suggest the company is exploring other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## "Home Run" Candidates
If a candidate is considered a "home run hire" who performs exceptionally well in interviews, the [[the_role_of_recruiters_and_hiring_managers_in_setting_job_criteria | hiring manager]] will act quickly to extend an offer to avoid losing them to another employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. In some cases, offers can be made on the same day as the first interview for exceptionally strong candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Significant delays between the interview and feedback typically imply the company is not fully convinced of the candidate's suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

For a strong candidate, a [[the_role_of_recruiters_and_hiring_managers_in_setting_job_criteria | hiring manager]] is often willing to work to accommodate salary expectations, even if they exceed the initial budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This might involve combining multiple jobs into one headcount or increasing equity stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The onus is on the candidate to present themselves as an "absolute Grand Slam hire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

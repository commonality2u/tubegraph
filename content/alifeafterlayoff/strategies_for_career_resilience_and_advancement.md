## The Illusion of "Surviving a Layoff"
The concept of "surviving a layoff" is a pervasive but inaccurate term, as nobody truly survives a layoff unaffected; everyone is impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>. Even those who retain their jobs experience significant trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53"></a>. The workplace culture is irreversibly altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34"></a>, and trust in the company, management, and job security is severely eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18"></a>.

After a layoff, the remaining employees often face doubled workloads with the same output expectations from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44"></a>. Despite increased pressure, individuals may feel unable to complain, believing they should just be grateful to have a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09"></a>.

### The End of Job Security
In today's market, job security is practically nonexistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45"></a>. Companies, even profitable ones, are increasingly conducting mass layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"></a>. The traditional career path, where individuals worked for one or two employers for decades and collected a pension, has been "completely shattered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00"></a>. It's now common to be laid off multiple times within a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10"></a>.

## Questionable Company Practices
Companies often behave poorly during layoffs, from leaking confidential lists of affected employees, as seen recently with LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53"></a>, to impersonal notifications such as badge deactivation, being locked out of equipment, or mass Zoom calls where employees are informed of their termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07"></a>. In some cases, layoffs occur without any severance pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25"></a>.

Companies frequently make misleading statements in town halls, claiming "everything is going great" or that they are "not thinking layoffs," only to proceed with cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12"></a>. This demonstrates a lack of trustworthiness, as their actions contradict their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24"></a>. This behavior significantly contributes to the erosion of trust within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39"></a>.

## Strategies for Protecting Your Career

Recognizing that your company no longer "has your back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04"></a>, it is crucial to adopt a proactive approach to [[strategies_for_protecting_your_career | protecting your career]]. If your company is conducting mass layoffs, especially in questionable ways, this should be a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14"></a>. The phrase "I didn't see it coming" should be removed from your vocabulary, as companies often provide implicit warnings through their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47"></a>.

### Act Like the CEO of Your Career
Embrace the mindset of being the "CEO of your career" or a "free agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26"></a>. This means taking decisive action to manage your professional trajectory:

*   **Update Your Resume**: Regularly refresh your resume to reflect your latest skills and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57"></a>.
*   **Networking**: Actively engage in networking to build and maintain professional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59"></a>.
*   **Proactive Job Search**: Aggressively explore new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29"></a>.
*   **Due Diligence for New Opportunities**: When interviewing for a new company, conduct thorough research into their history of layoffs, how they were handled, and if the position you're applying for was previously affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36"></a>. Challenge companies on why positions are being replaced so soon, especially if they recently laid off full-time staff and are rehiring for contract roles at lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53"></a>.

[[Strategies for career control and adaptation | Taking ownership]] of your career means being pragmatic and actively taking steps to secure your professional future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53"></a>.

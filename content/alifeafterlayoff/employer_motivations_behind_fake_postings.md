Despite conflicting data in the job market, with a record number of job openings coexisting with major corporate layoffs, a phenomenon known as "ghost postings" has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. These are essentially [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience | fake job postings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## What Are Ghost Postings?

A ghost posting is defined as a job listing that an employer has no genuine intention of ever filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### The "Pipelining Wreck"

One common type of ghost posting is referred to as a "pipelining wreck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is a job posted by an employer solely to collect resumes for a future date, without any immediate intention of filling the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The optics around such practices are considered shady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

From a [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience | candidate experience]] perspective, pipelining wrecks are viewed as very poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Job seekers, especially those who are laid off, invest significant time crafting targeted resumes and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Employers and talent acquisition leaders often lose sight of the job seeker's perspective, failing to consider the emotional toll of anxiously waiting for a response that will never come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Misleading Job Market Statistics

The overall number of job openings reported is misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Many of these record-high job postings are for contract, part-time, or seasonal positions that may not offer benefits and are not considered career-type jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This discrepancy makes job seekers question the narrative of a robust job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The rise in [[fake_job_postings_and_candidate_experience | fake job postings]] exacerbates this frustration, creating a "perfect storm" for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Employer Motivations Behind Ghost Postings

A Clarify Capital survey of 1,045 managers involved in hiring, conducted between August 31 and September 1, 2022, sheds light on why employers engage in ghost postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>:

*   **Always open to new people (50%)**: Employers keep job postings open to see who applies, akin to "window shopping" for talent without a specific hiring intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **To keep current employees motivated (31%)**: This is seen as a particularly sinister reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It involves deceptively suggesting that help is on the way for overworked staff, even when there's no real intention to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **To give the impression that the company is growing (30%)**: This practice is considered deceitful to both job candidates and investors and could potentially have legal implications from an SEC perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **The job was filled but forgotten to be deleted (29%)**: This is attributed to lazy recruiters or HR personnel, as filled positions should be removed from job boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **To have an active pool of candidates in case of turnover (23%)**: Employers maintain a pipeline of potential hires, mirroring the advice given to job seekers to always keep their resumes updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **In case an irresistible candidate applies (20%)**: This indicates a passive and "lazy" recruiting approach, where employers are not actively seeking but are open to a perfect fit if one happens to come along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **To placate overworked employees (12%)**: A small percentage but a significant motivation, tying back to keeping employees motivated by false pretenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **No particular reason (11%)**: Some employers simply don't care why the posting remains open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

Many employers admit they plan to fill active job postings several months down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This suggests ambiguity in hiring plans, possibly tied to layoffs or uncertain headcounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Ghost Postings

Job seekers can look for several [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] to avoid falling victim to ghost postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>:

*   **Posting Age**: If a job has been up for more than six months, or if the same listing is repeatedly posted, it's likely a ghost wreck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This could also indicate a poor quality employer with high turnover or indecisive hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Recent Layoffs**: Research if the company has had recent major layoffs, especially if the posted positions are similar to those affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This may suggest they are building a pipeline for future hires in vulnerable roles, indicating a lack of loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Job Description Detail**: Genuine job postings usually have a lot of specific detail about responsibilities, accomplishments, and who the role supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Generic, salesy descriptions are a major [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Recency of Post**: A job posted within the last week is much more likely to be an active and legitimate recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

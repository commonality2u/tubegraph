A video of a Cloudflare account executive being laid off went viral, drawing attention to how companies handle [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | corporate layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The experience highlighted a familiar "icky feeling" of poorly managed [[layoff_processes_and_communication | layoff processes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Layoff Incident

The account executive, a relatively new hire who had only been with the company for a few months, was called into an unexpected meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Her colleagues had been experiencing similar calls, leading her to anticipate what was coming and record the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The presence of an HR team member, especially someone previously unknown to the employee, is a strong indicator that a position is being terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The company conducted these layoffs in a "ruthless" person-by-person manner, rather than through impersonal mass emails or by denying building access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The news was delivered by two individuals, one from HR and an unknown director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### The Stated Reason: Performance

The reason given for the termination was that the employee "had not met Cloudflare performance expectations" for 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Following this, a severance agreement was presented, which, if signed, would release the company from any liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It is advised never to sign such an agreement on the spot, as it may waive rights, especially if the employee believes they were unfairly targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Employee's Rebuttal

The employee challenged the performance claim, highlighting several points:
*   **New Hire Status** She started on August 25th and had only completed a three-month "ramp" (onboarding period), meaning she had just entered full-time production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Limited Productive Time** Her productive period after ramping was limited to approximately two weeks in December, sandwiched between Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Positive Feedback** Her manager had consistently given her positive feedback in one-on-one meetings, stating she was doing a great job, had high activity, strong meetings, and was quickly learning products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. She had received no negative feedback or been placed on a performance improvement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Performance Metrics** Despite having the highest activity among her team and three contracts out, she hadn't officially closed any deals, which she argued didn't solely reflect her [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. She felt the company was "gaslighting" her about her [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Manager Involvement** She questioned why her manager was not present and seemingly unaware of the situation, noting it felt "odd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Company's Handling and HR's Role

The way the layoff was handled exposed several issues with the company's process:
*   **Lack of Transparency** The HR representatives could not provide specific performance metrics or clear explanations for why the employee was being laid off, despite her direct questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This suggests they were unprepared or unwilling to provide concrete reasons, leading to a sense of vagueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   **Impersonal and Cold** The decisions are often made impersonally, based on spreadsheets and data points, with managers often unaware that their direct reports are on a layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This results in a "cold" and "calculated" experience for employees, which can be jarring after being told they are doing a great job or that the company is "family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Questionable Justification** The use of performance as a reason was criticized as a "cop-out excuse," especially if it was a collective layoff. It was suggested that honesty about strategic changes would be better than fabricating performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Stating "fired for performance" could also negatively impact future rehire eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **HR Communication** The HR person's responses were described as "targeted and calculated and very non-committal," highlighting a tightrope walk to avoid legal situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The employee felt the HR representatives lacked empathy and understanding of the [[emotional_and_psychological_effects_of_layoffs | traumatizing impact]] of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Impact and Lessons Learned

The [[impact_of_layoffs_and_poor_company_practices | impact of layoffs]] like this can be "extremely traumatizing" and feel like a "huge slap in the face" for employees who have invested significant energy into their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

The CEO of Cloudflare acknowledged that the video was "very painful to watch" and admitted the company's mistake was "not being as kind and Humane" in their approach, though it's debated if a layoff can ever truly be "kind" or "humane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. The CEO's response was seen as an obligatory reaction to public backlash, with no fundamental change in the outcome for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

It was suggested that those responsible for incorrect hiring or workforce planning should be held accountable, rather than those newly hired being the first to be laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

The incident underscores the importance of employees viewing their careers pragmatically, acting as the "CEO of their career," and developing [[strategies_for_coping_with_layoffs | contingency plans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This includes building financial "nest eggs" and having alternative income streams to protect against unexpected job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

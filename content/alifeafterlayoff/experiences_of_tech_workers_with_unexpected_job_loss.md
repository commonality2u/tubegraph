A recent viral video showcased the firsthand experience of a Cloudflare account executive, Brittney Peach (TikTok: @BrittneyPeach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>), being laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This incident brought to light the often impersonal and sudden nature of [[Tech layoffs and job market challenges | tech layoffs]], resonating with many who have faced [[Career setbacks from unexpected layoffs | unexpected job loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Layoff Process Described

The account executive, a relatively new hire of only a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, was called into an unexpected meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. She anticipated the reason, as colleagues had been receiving similar 15-minute calendar invites throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Recognizing the pattern, she began recording the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

A key indicator of an impending termination is the unexpected presence of Human Resources (HR) on a call, especially if you've never interacted with them before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In this case, two individuals—an HR representative named Rosie and an unknown director—conducted the layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The process was described as ruthless, with individuals being laid off one after another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. While face-to-face (or virtual face-to-face) terminations are preferable to mass emails, Slack messages, or badge deactivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, the overall experience remains jarring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Company Justification vs. Employee Reality

The company's stated reason for termination was that the employee "had not met Cloudflare expectations for performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. However, the employee immediately pushed back on this claim:
*   She had only started on August 25th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   She had just completed a three-month "ramp-up" or onboarding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   Her effective "productive" time post-ramp was only about two weeks in December, sandwiched between major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   She maintained the highest activity among her team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   Her manager had consistently provided positive feedback, indicating she was doing a great job and picking up products quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   She had never been placed on a performance improvement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

The employee argued that this felt like "gaslighting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The HR representatives were unable to provide specific performance metrics or data to support their claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, leading to the suspicion that the company was trying to label her as "fired for performance" rather than admitting to broader layoffs due to over-hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

This situation highlights a lack of transparency, as managers are often unaware of layoff decisions made by higher-ups based on impersonal data spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Severance Agreements and Employee Rights

During a layoff, companies typically offer a severance agreement. It's crucial to understand that signing this agreement often means "releasing them from liability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This prevents employees from pursuing legal action, such as cases of age discrimination or unfair treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

It is strongly advised **never to sign a severance agreement on the spot** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Employees should take time to read through it carefully and, if they suspect unfair targeting, consult with an attorney before signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Companies are required to give employees time to consider the agreement and cannot pressure them into immediate signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Emotional Impact and Company Response

The employee expressed extreme frustration and trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, feeling that her dedication to the job was met with a "huge slap in the face" by being let go for no clear reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The HR representatives' responses were described as calculated and non-committal, avoiding specifics to mitigate legal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

The video went viral, leading to significant backlash and a response from the Cloudflare CEO. He admitted the video was "very painful to watch" and that the mistake was not being "as kind and humane as we were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. However, this acknowledgment did not change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. Critics argue that executives who overestimate hiring needs and poorly plan the workforce should be held accountable, as they are rarely the ones affected by the layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

In the current climate of widespread [[Tech layoffs and job market challenges | tech layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, individuals must:

In the evolving employment landscape, [[importance_of_proactive_career_management | proactive career management]] has emerged as a critical approach, often encapsulated by the trend known as "career cushioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This strategy emphasizes preparing for potential job market shifts before they negatively impact one's employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Evolution of Employment Trends Leading to Career Cushioning

The concept of career cushioning has gained prominence following several significant employment trends over recent years:

*   **2020 Economic Downturn and Layoffs** The pandemic resulted in a major economic downturn in 2020, leading many employers to make knee-jerk layoff decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Remaining employees often took on increased work burdens, leading to stress and long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This period saw a pervasive sentiment that employees should "just be happy to have a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **The Great Resignation** As workers experienced burnout and reevaluated their priorities, many chose to leave their jobs, initiating "The Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This shifted the power dynamic heavily towards job seekers, creating a "Heyday of job seeking" with abundant opportunities and raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Quiet Quitting** For those who didn't leave but were burnt out, "quiet quitting" became an option, where employees did the bare minimum without leaving their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Quiet Firing** As the labor market began to shift back towards employers, "quiet firing" emerged, where companies subtly encourage employees to quit rather than outright firing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Current Market Outlook (as of December 2022)

The labor market remains uncertain, with the pendulum increasingly swinging back towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While the overall labor market shows some strength, certain industries like Tech have experienced significant layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. A PwC study of 722 executives revealed that 50% are reducing their overall headcount, indicating a trend of companies "right-sizing" after potential over-hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This includes hiring freezes, reduced headcounts, decreased sign-on bonuses, and rescinded job offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## What is Career Cushioning?

Career cushioning is the latest employment trend, urging individuals to plan proactively to cushion the possibility of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. It's about setting up a safety net to ensure a softer landing if an unplanned income disruption occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. While the concept isn't entirely new, it provides a label for proactive career management strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The employment landscape has seen rapid shifts in recent years, from the [[great_resignation | Great Resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> to [[quiet_quitting | Quiet Quitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and [[quiet_firing | Quiet Firing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The latest trend emerging as of December 2022 is **Career Cushioning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This concept encourages individuals to take [[importance_of_being_proactive_in_your_career | proactive steps]] in their [[career management and planning | career management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> to build a safety net against potential job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## The Evolving Employment Landscape

The shift towards proactive career management is a response to recent market volatility:
*   **2020 Economic Downturn & Pandemic Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>: Employers laid off many, leading to increased work burdens and stress for remaining employees, alongside a pervasive "you should just be happy to have a job" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Burnout and Re-evaluation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>: This period led to widespread burnout and a re-evaluation of career goals, culminating in the [[great_resignation | Great Resignation]] as people sought more fulfilling work or left the workforce entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Job Seeker's Market** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>: The pendulum swung towards job seekers, creating a "heyday" of opportunities with rising salaries and frequent job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **[[quiet_quitting | Quiet Quitting]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>: Burned-out employees who didn't want to leave their jobs opted to do only the bare minimum required, a low-risk strategy due to abundant job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **[[quiet_firing | Quiet Firing]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>: As the market began to normalize, employers regained power, subtly encouraging disfavored employees to quit rather than outright firing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Current Market Uncertainty (as of Dec 2022)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>: The labor market is shaky and becoming more uncertain, with the pendulum swinging back towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. While the overall market shows strength, specific industries like tech have experienced significant layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 722 executives revealed that 50% are reducing headcount despite concerns about hiring and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Indicators include hiring freezes, reduced headcounts, lower sign-on bonuses, and 44% of companies rescinding offers or canceling jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## What is Career Cushioning?

Career cushioning is a [[strategies_for_effective_career_progression | proactive approach]] to [[career management and planning | career planning]] that involves anticipating the possibility of job loss and taking steps to prepare for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It's about creating a safety net, likened to having a backup plan in dating to soften a potential breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This isn't a new concept but rather a new label for what many [[comparing_proactive_versus_passive_career_management | proactive individuals]] already do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Strategies for Proactive Career Management (Career Cushioning)

Practicing career cushioning means consistently taking [[strategies_for_career_development_and_job_searching | proactive steps]] to protect your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Individuals should act like "free agents," prioritizing their own career interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

The following [[strategies_for_career_advancement_and_job_search | strategies for career advancement and job search]] are recommended:

1.  **Update and Optimize Your Online Profile** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>:
    *   Ensure your LinkedIn profile is current and optimized to attract recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. (Resources like "Unlocking LinkedIn" can help understand recruiter perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>).
2.  **Actively Build Your Professional Network** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
    *   Cultivate active networks, especially on platforms like LinkedIn, with individuals who could potentially assist your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   Consider reaching out to recruiters for "soft feelers" to keep your resume visible, even if not actively job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
3.  **Keep Your Resume Current** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>:
    *   Having an up-to-date resume prevents scrambling during a layoff, reducing unnecessary stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
4.  **Define Your Career Goals and Address Skill Gaps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>:
    *   Reflect on what truly makes you happy in your career and outline steps to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   Assess your current skills, identify any gaps, and create a plan for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Doing this while gainfully employed minimizes stress later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> and helps you filter job opportunities aligning with your core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

By consistently implementing these [[strategies_for_career_management_postlayoff | strategies for career management]], potential career "hiccups" can be managed as minor inconveniences rather than major crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This proactive approach ensures you are prepared for unexpected income disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> and allows you to take control of your [[career planning and job market strategy | career trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

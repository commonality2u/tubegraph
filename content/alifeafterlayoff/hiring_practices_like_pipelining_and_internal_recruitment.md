Navigating the job market can be frustrating, especially when job seekers apply repeatedly without success, often due to certain hiring practices that can be misleading or challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25">[00:25]</a>. In a difficult job market, characterized by significant layoffs and an influx of candidates, companies sometimes employ practices that make the job search harder for external applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17">[01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26">[01:26]</a>.

## Pipelining Reqs

Pipelining requisitions are job postings that companies publish with no immediate intention of filling the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04">[03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[03:58]</a>.
They are primarily designed to collect applications for future use, theoretically allowing companies to quickly move candidates when a position does open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01">[04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10">[04:10]</a>.

### Issues with Pipelining Reqs

Despite their theoretical purpose, pipelining requisitions rarely work well in practice and are considered deceptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>. They can be very off-putting to job seekers, especially in a tough market, because they raise hopes for roles that will never be filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>. Companies may collect resumes through these postings and then close the role without hiring anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33">[04:33]</a>. The timing of such postings can be particularly bad, especially if they appear after recent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25">[06:25]</a>.

### Identifying Pipelining Reqs

It can be challenging for job seekers to differentiate genuine job postings from pipelining requisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>. However, some indicators include:
*   **Generic Titles** Titles like "Open career opportunities" often suggest a pipelining req <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58">[05:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of Specificity** The job description will typically lack specific details about the role, responsibilities, or a particular position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39">[05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53">[05:53]</a>. There is often nothing concrete to apply to or prepare for an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a>.

While deceptive, pipelining requisitions are relatively rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>. However, their existence contributes to the [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | difficulty in finding a job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51">[06:51]</a>.

## Internal Recruitment

Another common reason why it's hard to get a job is when a position, despite being publicly posted, is ultimately filled by an internal applicant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56">[06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01">[07:01]</a>.

### Reasons for Internal Hires

Companies often prefer to fill roles internally, especially when they are hesitant to increase their overall headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02">[07:02]</a>. This means they may be moving existing employees between roles rather than bringing in new talent from outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06">[07:06]</a>.

### Impact on External Candidates

Organizations sometimes have requirements to conduct external recruitment for certain positions, even if they have an internal candidate in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14">[07:14]</a>. This practice can lead to external candidates being removed from the process at the last minute when an internal candidate steps in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27">[07:27]</a>. Unfortunately, this scenario occurs somewhat regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30">[07:30]</a>.

The presence of internal candidates contributes to the [[high_competition_and_selective_hiring_processes | stiff competition]] in the job market, making it more challenging for external job seekers to secure positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44">[08:44]</a>. This is particularly true for highly desirable jobs that are remote, offer high wages, or are with reputable companies, which attract thousands of applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07">[10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10">[09:10]</a>. To stand out, job seekers need a well-optimized resume and a strong interview performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52">[09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42">[11:42]</a>.

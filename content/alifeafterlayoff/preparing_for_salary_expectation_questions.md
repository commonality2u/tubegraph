Navigating salary discussions during a job interview can be challenging, but preparation is key to making a favorable impression. Understanding when and how to discuss pay can significantly impact your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## When to Discuss Salary

It is generally advised that the candidate avoid asking about salary too early in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Asking about pay right out of the gate can be a "big turn off" for employers, as it might suggest a primary motivation for the role is financial before understanding the full scope of the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:4:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Instead, allow the recruiter to initiate the conversation about salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If you have advanced to later rounds of interviews (e.g., the second round), salary discussions should have already occurred with the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Avoid asking the hiring manager about pay ranges, as they rarely have the final say on compensation, and it might appear you are "fishing for a better answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## How to Respond When Asked

While you should not initiate the conversation, it is crucial to be prepared to answer when the recruiter asks about your [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_interviews | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Failing to provide a clear answer, or stating that you don't know the local market rate, demonstrates a lack of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Avoiding the question or attempting to postpone the discussion will likely result in not advancing to the next round of interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

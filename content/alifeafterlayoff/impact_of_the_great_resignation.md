The [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] was a period, particularly in 2021 and through most of 2022, when the job market was highly favorable for job seekers, with companies actively recruiting talent and offering lucrative opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Many individuals decided to quit their jobs during this time to pursue new roles, often seeking better pay, improved work-life balance, or a change in career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Key Impacts and Consequences

### Misperception of the Current Job Market
Many who participated in the [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] and secured new jobs before the market downturn may not realize the current job market climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The job market is now "not really that good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and "extremely competitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, with companies receiving thousands of applications for a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Challenges in Replacing Jobs
A significant impact is the difficulty many are now experiencing in replacing jobs after quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Some individuals who previously had no trouble finding new opportunities are now struggling to get interviews or even phone calls from recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This is partly due to the increased competition, with job seekers now competing with double or triple the number of candidates compared to a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### The Shift in Remote Work
A notable trend during the [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] was the uptake of remote job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. However, this has changed rapidly, with companies increasingly mandating a return to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. As a result, many who took remote roles are now facing the decision to quit again if forced back to the office, only to find that new remote or hybrid opportunities are scarce and their phone is not ringing as it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### The "Great Regret" Phenomenon
Many individuals who participated in the [[the_great_resignation_phenomenon | Great Resignation]] are now feeling stuck or regretting their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This has led to a new phenomenon termed "The Great Regret," where people acknowledge having made significant career mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Tech Industry Specifics
During the "heyday for job seekers" in 2021 and 2022, many rebranded themselves for technical roles like software developers to chase the tech boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, the tech market experienced a significant downturn in late 2022 and into 2023, causing large job offers to dry up overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This left a glut of people who had rebranded struggling to find employment in their new fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Economic Cooldown and Salary Resets
There are increasing signs of an economic cooldown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Parallel to this, companies are resetting salaries, leading to fewer lucrative job offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This negatively impacts those looking to jump ship for a salary increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Strategic Career Management
Given the current market, it is often recommended not to quit a job as a first option, unless facing a "truly toxic situation" involving illegal activities, ethical breaches, harassment, or a hostile work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. For those gainfully employed, the advice is to focus on making resumes shine to compete effectively and to seek stable industries with growth and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Acting as the "CEO of your career" means making smart, strategic decisions rather than knee-jerk reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Establishing clear boundaries with coworkers is crucial for career progression and maintaining [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professionalism]] in the [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Over-sharing, engaging in gossip, or associating with negative individuals can damage your reputation and hinder your [[managing_workplace_relationships_for_career_growth | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## A Hard-Learned Lesson
The speaker recounts a personal experience early in their career as an HR professional in a manufacturing and global engineering company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While working in a small town, they befriended a line worker who was about their age, developing a good [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | rapport]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. After going out for drinks, an innocent comment made by the speaker about a new, inexperienced supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> was misinterpreted and reported to their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This incident led to a [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | credibility issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> and necessitated an apology to the supervisor to preserve an effective working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This experience highlighted the importance of being very careful with whom you choose to be friendly at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Dangers of Over-Sharing and Gossip
Even seemingly innocent comments, when over-shared, can find their way back to your boss, leading to a major [[importance_of_workplace_communication_and_accountability | credibility issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. If your boss perceives you as untrustworthy, it can stunt your [[managing_workplace_relationships_for_career_growth | long-term career potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Furthermore, engaging in [[importance_of_workplace_communication_and_accountability | gossiping]] can brand you as an "office gossip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. People, especially leaders, observe who associates with specific "clicks" within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Associating with those who stir up drama or are known gossips can hinder your upward movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. When at common gathering spots like the water cooler, it's advised to keep interactions brief to avoid being drawn into drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As an HR professional, the speaker frequently encountered [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | employee relation situations]] stemming from office gossips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Avoiding Negative Influences
Office gossips are often negative individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Spending too much time with colleagues who constantly complain about the boss, company, or pay can inevitably bring you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. A few negative individuals can become a "cancer" in a group and be distracting, especially if you are focused on [[managing_workplace_relationships_for_career_growth | upward mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## The Impact of Competition and Socializing
Even if you are friendly with a [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | coworker]], a promotion opportunity can make the relationship competitive and awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. If you become a supervisor over a former close [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | coworker]] who knows your "dirty secrets," it can compromise your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. An unscrupulous [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | coworker]] might leverage this knowledge, or jealousy can hold back your progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

When attending social events like happy hours with [[workplace_relationships_and_dynamics | coworkers]], it's essential to exercise caution, especially when alcohol is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Loose lips, being "touchy-feely," or telling off-color jokes can easily cross the line into [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | harassment]] or offend someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. As a rule in HR, anything said or done at work, or at work-related events, can come back to haunt you later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

While it is possible to make lasting friendships with coworkers, it is crucial to carefully select your friends and be cautious about your behavior, what you say, and what you share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

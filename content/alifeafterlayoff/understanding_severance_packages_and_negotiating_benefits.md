When experiencing a layoff, understanding and negotiating your severance package is a critical step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It's crucial to review the agreement carefully before signing, as companies typically provide at least a couple of weeks for this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The severance package is designed to limit the company's liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Reviewing Your Severance Agreement

It's important to thoroughly understand all components of your severance agreement and identify any areas that might be negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. While leverage may be limited, especially if you are in a protected class (e.g., over age 40), it is still worth asking for additional benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Examples of items to inquire about include missed bonuses or unvested equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Healthcare Benefits: COBRA vs. Government Marketplace

A significant component of a severance package is the continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Companies are required to offer COBRA coverage, which allows you to continue your previous employer's health benefits for a period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. However, under COBRA, you are responsible for the full cost of the benefits, making it extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Instead of opting for COBRA, it is often more financially beneficial to request a lump sum payout for the continuation of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. With this lump sum, you can then purchase a new plan through the government Marketplace, specifically a catastrophic plan, to minimize cost exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. When your income is drastically reduced due to a layoff, there are significant tax benefits that can lead to savings of several thousand dollars by using the Marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Outplacement Assistance

Many companies offer outplacement assistance as part of the severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This service typically involves connecting you with a company that helps with resume writing, job search strategies, and consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

However, based on experience, the quality of advice and resumes provided by some outplacement services can be "horrifically bad" and may not effectively help individuals secure new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. A recommended strategy is to request the outplacement assistance as a lump sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This lump sum, which can range from $3,000 to $5,000, can then be used to engage an independent career coach who can provide a higher level of personalized service and potentially save you money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Every dollar counts when you are unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

A "working interview" is a practice where a job candidate is asked to perform actual job tasks or solve business problems, often without compensation, as part of the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This approach is frequently cited as a significant [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] in the job search, indicating a potentially low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Case Study: A Boutique Recruiting Firm's Approach

A LinkedIn post by the CEO of a San Diego-based boutique recruiting firm provided a stark example of the pitfalls of working interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>. The CEO's post, intended as a "teaching moment," outlined her firm's interview process for recruiters, particularly those recently laid off with under one year of experience in a difficult market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

### The Interview Process
Initially, the process involved mock interviews and candidate pitches to assess abilities and delivery, which can be a fair way to demonstrate competency not evident on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. However, the firm then offered "working interviews" to candidates who "needed training," providing them with two current job openings to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

### Key Red Flags Identified:
*   **"Heart and Hustle" Culture**: The CEO emphasized "heart and hustle," a phrase often associated with "hustle culture" and unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Unpaid Labor**: Candidates were expected to spend "four to five days" working on actual job assignments to "prove" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This involved solving real business issues that, if performed by a contractor, would be compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **"Dangling Carrot"**: The CEO justified this by saying the "payoff" was "landing an amazing opportunity" and potentially a first commission, implying a 100% commission-based role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:50]</a>. This sets up young, inexperienced candidates for potential failure in a difficult market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
*   **"Go the Extra Mile"**: The employer explicitly sought candidates willing to "go the extra mile," which is another [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] suggesting a toxic work environment and unreasonable demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.
*   **Gaslighting**: The CEO's narrative gaslighted candidates, implying that unwillingness to jump through these "endless hoops" demonstrated a lack of character or insufficient desire for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. She claimed to be "giving them an opportunity to shine" in a tough market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.

### Candidate and Public Reaction
One candidate wisely withdrew from the process, valuing her time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. Her decision was praised as a demonstration of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. The CEO later publicly criticized this candidate on LinkedIn for withdrawing, instead of responding professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. The candidate then publicly defended herself, asserting that interviews should respect candidates' time and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.

The LinkedIn post garnered significant negative attention, with many commenters, particularly talent acquisition professionals, criticizing the practice as "stealing labor" and "predatory practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. The CEO's responses were seen as narcissistic and out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>.

## Why Working Interviews Are Detrimental
Working interviews are widely considered a [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] for several reasons:

*   **Exploitation of Vulnerable Candidates**: They take advantage of job seekers, especially those unemployed, who may be desperate for work and willing to perform unpaid labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **Disrespect for Time and Skills**: They demand significant unpaid time and effort from candidates, without guaranteed compensation or a clear path to an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
*   **Unethical Business Practice**: Utilizing candidates to solve actual business problems without pay is essentially "stealing labor" and generating profit from uncompensated work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.
*   **Indicator of Low-Quality Employer**: Companies that employ such practices often lack respect for their employees, operate with unreasonable demands, and may foster a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Stress for Candidates**: Job searching is already a full-time job involving [[preparing_for_interviews_and_misleading_practices | preparing for interviews]], customizing resumes, and networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Adding lengthy, unpaid working interviews increases the burden and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Advice for Job Seekers
When encountering such practices, job seekers should:
*   **Trust Your Gut Instinct**: If an interview process feels wrong, it likely is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.
*   **Have Self-Respect**: Do not fall for demands for endless hoops and unpaid labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. Your time, energy, and resources are valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
*   **Recognize Unremarkable Companies**: Working for a "mom-and-pop recruiting shop" or other unremarkable companies that demand free labor is unlikely to be a resume builder or a springboard to reputable companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on High-Quality Employers**: Prioritize companies that respect candidates' time and skills and adhere to industry standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Predatory Practices**: Learn to identify and steer clear of employers who engage in such exploitative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

Assessing a company's [[assessing_company_turnover_rates | turnover rates]] is crucial when determining its overall stability and quality as an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Particularly strong companies tend not to have significant turnover issues, as employees generally do not wish to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Types of Turnover

When evaluating turnover, focus on involuntary turnover, such as terminations or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. A company that conducts layoffs and then rehires for those positions shortly after may indicate a "knee-jerk reaction" approach, which can leave employees feeling uncertain about their job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Ideal Turnover Rates

The industry standard turnover rate is approximately 20%, though this can vary by sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. When considering all industries combined, a company with an [[high_turnover_rates | under 20% turnover rate]] is generally desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These lower rates are strong indicators of a positive corporate culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Assessing Turnover as a Job Seeker

As an external candidate, it can be challenging to determine a company's exact turnover rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, you can conduct "investigative sleuthing" by checking press releases for recent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Additionally, companies that invest in personal development for their employees typically experience very low turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Other Contributing Factors to Low Turnover

Beyond direct turnover rates, other factors contribute to a stable and desirable company environment, often resulting in lower turnover:

*   **Promotion from Within**
    Companies with a culture of internal promotion, where employees are moved into more advanced roles, show that applying oneself can lead to career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Competitive Compensation and Benefits**
    Companies that position themselves as "pay leaders" and consistently invest in and expand their benefits packages tend to attract and retain high-caliber candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **High Company Ratings**
    Consistently high ratings on platforms like Glassdoor, Indeed, or Comparably, particularly concerning pay philosophy, benefit structure, and leadership behavior, indicate a good workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Investment in Employee Experience**
    Employers that offer rewards and recognition programs and celebrate personal milestones (like birthdays, weddings, or births) beyond work-related achievements contribute to a positive employment experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Involving employees' families in company events also enhances the overall experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Balance**
    Great companies hire adequate staff to ensure manageable workloads and prioritize employee time off for rest and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Concerns about long hours or work-life balance in reviews are a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Transparent Leadership**
    Leadership teams that are honest, transparent, and embody the company's core values foster trust and positively impact employee retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Positive Employee Morale**
    Observing a workplace where people appear to be enjoying their work and their colleagues often indicates high morale and a desirable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

This article outlines and ranks 15 different ways to look for a job, from least to most effective, based on the personal experience of a corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience in interviewing and hiring thousands of people for large organizations [00:00:33]. The rankings are subjective and prioritize methods that lead to quicker job placement and a higher return on investment for the job seeker's time [00:01:12]. Distinctions are made between methods favoring blue-collar versus white-collar roles [00:01:26]. Each method is assigned a score between 1 and 10, with 10 being the best "bang for your buck" [00:01:35].

## Ranking Methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

The ranking is subjective, drawing from 20 years of experience in interviewing and hiring [00:00:52]. Key assumptions include:
*   The job seeker aims to secure a job as quickly as possible [00:01:15].
*   The job seeker wants to maximize the return on time invested in their job search [00:01:20].
*   Some methods are more suitable for blue-collar workers, while others favor white-collar professionals [00:01:26].

## Job Search Methods Ranked

### 1. Cold Calling - Score: 1/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
Cold calling involves soliciting a job without knowing if the employer has an opening [00:01:49]. This includes calling human resources departments, dropping in unannounced, or sending unsolicited notes on LinkedIn asking for a job [00:01:56]. As a corporate recruiter, this method almost never works [00:02:15]. The time and energy spent on cold calling, especially physical visits, are not a good use of time [00:02:20].

### 2. Social Media Engagement - Score: 1/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
Engaging with a company's social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) in hopes of being noticed by a hiring team has a very slim chance of success [00:03:31]. Human Resources and Talent Acquisition teams generally do not manage social media, which is typically handled by marketing departments [00:02:47]. Recruiters are unlikely to see these engagements or consider them for hiring [00:03:11]. It's essentially a form of cold calling [00:03:23].

### 3. Job Fairs - Score: 2/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
Job fairs, often found through local unemployment centers or universities, can be somewhat effective, particularly for blue-collar roles or entry-level university positions [00:03:42]. However, from an employer's perspective, finding well-qualified candidates is rare [00:04:01]. Competition among job seekers is stiff, and the return for the employer's time spent is generally low [00:04:48]. For the job seeker, it's like "window shopping" and not a targeted approach [00:04:57].

### 4. Industry Events / In-Person Networking - Score: 3/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>
Similar to job fairs, industry events or networking mixers involve mingling with people in your industry [00:05:18]. This is an untargeted way to look for a job, as the chances of someone having an immediate opening that aligns with your qualifications and interest are slim [00:05:31]. While it can lead to long-term contacts, it's often awkward for individuals, especially introverts [00:05:35].

### 5. Online Forums - Score: 3/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
Participating in online forums (e.g., Reddit, tech forums, LinkedIn groups) for networking is generally not a targeted recruiting method [00:06:20]. If an employer posts an opportunity, it can lead to a "feeding frenzy" of applicants [00:06:50]. While recruiters might source candidates from tech forums, especially for niche sub-genres where individuals demonstrate aptitude, actively building a knowledge repository in a forum is not the most efficient use of time for a quick job search [00:07:00].

### 6. Professional Associations - Score: 4/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
Joining professional associations (like SHRM for Human Resources) can be beneficial, especially if you can get involved in committees or become recognized as an expert [00:07:42]. This method is more geared towards white-collar professionals and can be a decent way to brand yourself within a specific local labor market [00:08:16].

### 7. Company Websites - Score: 5/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
Applying directly through a company's website ensures your resume is seen by a recruiter, as it filters into their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) [00:08:26]. This bypasses issues where applications on external job boards (like Indeed) might not automatically sync with the company's ATS [00:08:50]. If you see a job advertised on a job board, it's often worth applying directly on the company's site for a slightly higher chance of visibility [00:09:11]. This is part of effective [[job_application_process_and_strategies | job application process and strategies]].

### 8. Headhunters / Agencies / Job Houses - Score: 5/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
These third-party recruiters are contracted by employers to fill positions [00:09:26]. While they may have other roles, if you're not a fit for the primary position they considered you for, the connection often fizzles quickly [00:09:54]. Using an agency doesn't cost the job seeker, so there's no reason not to, but you shouldn't rely solely on them; you must still take ownership of your job search activities [00:10:12].

### 9. Personal Website / Blog - Score: 5/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
Setting up a personal website or blog allows you to brand yourself as an expert and showcase a portfolio of work [00:10:45]. This is particularly useful and often necessary for creative fields (e.g., graphic design, photography) [00:10:52]. Writing niche content can attract companies seeking experts [00:11:06]. However, it requires effort to set up and doesn't yield immediate results, making it a longer-term strategy [00:11:25]. This contributes to [[strategies_for_selfmarketing_and_job_hunting_success | self-marketing and job hunting success]].

### 10. Job Boards - Score: 6/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>
The most common way people look for jobs is through job boards like LinkedIn or Indeed [00:11:39]. The main challenge is competing with many other applicants, sometimes thousands for a single posting [00:11:48]. Employers also use other methods to source candidates, meaning a job posting might attract a larger pool than you realize [00:12:02]. Recruiters fill a relatively small percentage (5-10%) of their jobs through active job postings because many applicants are not well-aligned [00:12:32]. Despite the effort and potential unfairness, it's worth doing, as it only takes one offer to become employed [00:13:01]. Applying to job boards is a core part of [[job_application_process_and_strategies | job application process and strategies]].

### 11. Online Networking - Score: 7/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>
Less intimidating than in-person networking, online networking, typically done on LinkedIn, can be a powerful way to look for a job if done correctly [00:13:15]. It requires targeted effort rather than simply sending unsolicited connection requests or inmails, which can be seen as cold calling [00:13:33]. This is a key aspect of [[strategies_for_career_advancement_and_job_search | strategies for career advancement and job search]].

### 12. Responding to Advertisements - Score: 7/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>
Responding to "help wanted" signs on billboards, trucks, or storefronts is a decent way to find jobs, especially for blue-collar roles [00:14:03]. If a company is actively advertising outward, it often indicates they are struggling to find applicants, increasing your chances of being seen [00:14:46]. This method is less effective for white-collar positions, as major corporations typically don't use such visible "help wanted" signs [00:14:56].

### 13. Internships / Co-ops - Score: 7/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>
For entry-level job seekers, internships and co-ops are probably the most powerful way to land a first job, especially without relevant industry experience [00:15:10]. They provide a significant advantage over competitors, offer a foot in the door at an organization, and allow you to build goodwill with potential hiring managers [00:15:23]. This aligns with [[strategies_for_career_development_and_job_searching | strategies for career development and job searching]].

### 14. Industry Contacts - Score: 8/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>
Leveraging industry contacts, especially former colleagues or bosses who are now at other organizations, is a very powerful way to get hired [00:15:43]. Often, a former manager can pull you into their new company, potentially bypassing a deep interview process and ensuring a fair compensation rate [00:16:24]. Maintaining close ties with influential people in your network is crucial [00:16:49]. This is part of [[strategies_for_successful_job_searching_and_interviewing | strategies for successful job searching and interviewing]].

### 15. Employee Referrals - Score: 8/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>
If you know someone working for a company you're interested in, reaching out for an employee referral is highly recommended [00:16:55]. Referrers often receive a bonus, and referred candidates almost always get preference over external applicants, often skipping to the front of the line for interviews [00:17:07]. The only type of candidate that receives higher preference is an internal applicant [00:17:18]. Cultivating these networks is definitely worth your time [00:17:30]. This is a core [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_improve_visibility_and_competitiveness | strategy for job seekers to improve visibility and competitiveness]].

### 16. Outbound Sourcing (Being Discoverable) - Score: 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>
This is the most effective method, as it's how most recruiters (80% or more) fill their jobs [00:17:44]. Outbound sourcing involves recruiters actively searching the market (e.g., LinkedIn) for candidates who closely match a hiring manager's profile [00:17:51]. While you can't control what a recruiter is looking for, you can optimize your profile to be discoverable for desired jobs [00:18:03]. If a recruiter finds you, you're pulled to the front of the line and don't need to go through the full application process [00:18:12]. Understanding how recruiters source candidates and making yourself discoverable is the single best thing for your job search [00:18:35]. This is a key [[strategies_for_job_seekers_in_the_current_tech_job_market | strategy for job seekers in the current tech job market]] and [[strategies_for_successful_interviews_and_job_seeking | strategies for successful interviews and job seeking]].

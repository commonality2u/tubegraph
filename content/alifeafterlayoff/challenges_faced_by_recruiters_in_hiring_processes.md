Recruiters frequently encounter various [[Recruitment and hiring process errors | challenges]] that can lead to negative candidate experiences, such as employment ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Employment ghosting is defined as an employer or company representative moving a candidate into a formalized interviewing process but failing to follow up on the application status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Common Challenges Faced by Recruiters

### Lazy Recruiting
One of the most common reasons for employment ghosting is lazy recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Recruiters may be too busy with other tasks to follow up and provide closure on an interview process they initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This can stem from disorganization, a lack of focus on candidate experience, or simply forgetting to follow up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. In some cases, it's due to recruiters simply not being very good at their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Bad Work Processes
Companies with poor internal controls often struggle with recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Organizations without a formalized talent acquisition department within their human resources department tend to have more [[Recruitment and hiring process errors | difficulties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Without established best practices in recruiting, candidate experience is likely to suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Additionally, outdated or inadequate software can hinder a company's ability to manage a high volume of applicants properly, leading to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
Recruiters in a professional setting should ideally manage 15 to 25 requisitions, depending on the industry and role complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. When recruiters are assigned 40 to 50 requisitions—double the manageable workload—candidate experience inevitably suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. With a typical metric of sending three interviewable candidates per job, a recruiter with 40+ jobs might be dealing with over 200 candidates at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Even the most organized recruiters can see candidates fall through the cracks under such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Forgetting to Follow Up
Due to high workloads and a lack of proper tools or processes, recruiters can simply forget to follow up with candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. While not an excuse for poor performance, this oversight does occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness and Delays
A significant challenge for recruiters is [[Understanding recruiter and hiring manager dynamics | hiring manager indecisiveness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Hiring managers may delay decisions on candidates for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. They might request to see additional candidates even after suitable ones have been presented, which can delay the hiring process by weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Recruiters often need to push back on indecisive hiring managers to disposition candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Furthermore, hiring managers sometimes fail to meet their promised turnaround times for candidate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Jobs may be placed on hold or re-scoped mid-process, leading to delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Hiring managers sometimes request to keep current candidates "lukewarm" while seeking a different level of candidate or a new slate, which is frustrating for recruiters as there is no good way to communicate this to candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. If the requisition is simply closed, recruiters do not always follow up with all remaining candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Hiring Another Candidate Without Closing Others
A recruiter might close out a requisition after hiring a candidate without following up and closing out all other candidates who were in process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is another symptom of poor work processes or bad recruiting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Impact of Poor Candidate Experience
Organizations like Amazon prioritize candidate experience, understanding that candidates are often also customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Poor treatment during the interview process, such as ghosting, can negatively impact a candidate's perception of the company and potentially lead to them choosing not to support the business as a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Recruiters and CEOs are encouraged to treat job candidates as they would valued customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

> [!INFO] Amazon's Candidate Experience Standard
> Amazon holds its recruiters accountable to strict metrics around candidate experience, implementing a "two and five promise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If a candidate reaches a hiring manager phone screen, the company promises to provide a status update within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. If a candidate completes an on-site interview loop, feedback is promised within five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This system forces hiring teams to be efficient and decisive, with recruiters pushing for quick answers to maintain their metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

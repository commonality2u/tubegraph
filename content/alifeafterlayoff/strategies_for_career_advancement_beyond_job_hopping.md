The viability of job hopping as a primary career advancement strategy appears to be diminishing, particularly in the current economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While previously a successful method for quick salary increases, especially early in a career, market shifts suggest a need for alternative approaches to [[strategies_for_effective_career_management | career management]] and progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>.

## Understanding Job Hopping

Job hopping is defined as frequently moving from one job to another in a relatively short period, often at the same career level, without clear progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. Employers commonly view this negatively, perceiving it as an indicator that an employee may not stay long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

### The Rise of Job Hopping (2021-2022)

Job hopping became a popular strategy for swift salary band progression, particularly for new entrants to the workforce between 2021 and 2022, during a peak job market for [[strategies_for_job_seekers_and_career_changes | job seekers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:26">[02:13:26]</a>. This period saw rapid changes in the industry, especially in the tech market, where roles like software developers became highly sought after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:44">[02:41:44]</a>. Companies like Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Google engaged in bidding wars, driving up salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:49">[05:42:49]</a>. Junior professionals especially benefited, moving quickly through roles and securing significant salary increases, often 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:03">[02:51:03]</a>. This trend extended beyond tech to other industries, contributing to phenomena like "the great resignation," where individuals sought better-paying roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:33">[03:16:33]</a>.

During October-November 2022, the peak of the job market, job switchers saw an average wage increase of 7.7%, significantly higher than the 2% lower increase for those who stayed in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:20">[08:17:20]</a>.

### The Decline of Job Hopping (2023-2024)

Since 2023, the job market has experienced a significant downturn, making it much harder to find well-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:55">[03:53:55]</a>. Employers have begun to tighten up, actively trying to bring wages down through layoffs and restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:13">[06:11:13]</a>. This shift is evident in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's wage survey data, which shows a steady decrease in overall wage growth since late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:08">[06:07:08]</a>.

By January 2025, the incentive for leaving jobs has nearly vanished, with job switchers seeing a 4.8% increase versus 4.6% for those who stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:18">[10:15:18]</a>. This indicates that while strategic job hops may still offer some salary or level advancement, it is far less lucrative than a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:32">[10:29:32]</a>.

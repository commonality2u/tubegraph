Navigating the interview process can be challenging, often likened to traversing a minefield where a single misstep can ruin the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Many rejections stem from what candidates say or don't say, even seemingly innocent remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Maintaining a professional demeanor and avoiding certain pitfalls is crucial for making a positive [[First Impressions During Job Interviews | first impression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## What to Avoid Saying in an Interview

As a corporate recruiter, there are specific statements or questions that can immediately put a candidate in the "no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Demonstrating a Lack of Research
Asking basic questions about the company or the role indicates a lack of preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **"What does the company do?"** Asking this shows you are very unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Recruiters expect candidates to have done basic research on the company's core business, products, divisions, competitors, and new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This research demonstrates interest in the company's mission, vision, and values, and helps assess cultural alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **"What is the role?"** While recruiters will provide details, candidates are expected to have thoroughly read the job description and understand the position's objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Asking about the role without prior homework shows a lack of initiative and suggests you might need constant guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Appearing Disinterested or Work-Averse
Certain questions can make you seem less committed to the job itself.
*   **"What are the hours?"** For professional, salaried positions, asking about specific hours suggests you are a "clock watcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While concerns about work-life balance are valid, it's better to inquire about company culture, expectations in the first 90 days, or shift support without implying a desire to avoid work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Immediately asking about promotional opportunities:** While a career path is a reasonable expectation, directly asking about getting your boss's job early on can make you appear uninterested in the current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Frame questions around long-term career paths and growth opportunities, emphasizing your excitement for the role at hand and eagerness to learn about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Asking about salary too early:** Inquiring about salary at the very beginning of the interview process can be a major turn-off for employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The recruiter typically introduces this topic, especially in initial screening interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If you've passed the first round, salary expectations should have already been discussed, so don't bring it up again with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Negative Self-Presentation
How you talk about yourself and past experiences reflects on your professionalism.
*   **Talking poorly about a previous company or boss:** While tempting, recruiters are not interested in complaints about past employers or managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This reflects negatively on you and isn't a good look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Instead, be gracious, apply lessons learned, and show genuine interest in the new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Constantly stating how nervous you are:** A degree of nervousness is expected, especially in a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. However, being overly nervous can hurt your chances, particularly with hiring managers who have less patience for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The best advice is to be well-prepared and confident in your ability to sell yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. [[Selfawareness in job interviews | Self-awareness]] of your nerves is good, but dwelling on them can be detrimental.

### Lack of Professionalism in Communication
Your communication style plays a significant role in your perceived professionalism.
*   **Being too casual:** While some looseness can break the ice, being overly casual, using colorful language, or addressing interviewers with terms like "boss" or "bro" can be offensive or considered derogatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. It's best to default to formal address unless instructed otherwise and keep interactions polished and professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This aligns with [[Effective communication techniques for job interviews | effective communication techniques]] during job interviews.

### Failing to Engage and Prepare
*   **Not answering salary expectation questions:** When asked about salary expectations, avoiding the question or stating you are unprepared (e.g., "I don't know what the local market pays") will prevent you from moving to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. You should already have a number in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Not asking questions at the end of the interview:** When given the opportunity, not having well-thought-out, intelligent questions about the company, culture, or your fit within the organization shows a lack of interest or awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Always come [[Preparing questions for interviewers | prepared]] with a list of questions to demonstrate engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

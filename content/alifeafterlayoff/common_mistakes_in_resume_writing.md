As a recruiter and career coach, Brian from Life After Layoff frequently reviews resumes and identifies common issues that hinder job seekers' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there's no single "right" way to write a resume, the ultimate test is whether it achieves the desired results, such as landing job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The tips provided are based on a corporate recruiter's perspective, focusing on how resumes are screened quickly (often in a 5-second glance) and feedback from hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The goal of a resume is to capture attention quickly and secure a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Common Resume Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Using Outdated or Overly Designed Templates

[!WARNING|Mistake]
Many job seekers use templates found on sites like Canva.com or large resume hubs, which often include graphics, charts, and "cute" presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These designs, frequently created by graphic designers, can distract from the resume's purpose of quickly conveying information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. They are often not designed with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in mind, which struggle to parse such designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

[!TIP|Solution]
Opt for simple templates, like those available on Microsoft Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Choose a one-column layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Avoid bright, flashy colors and excessive graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Ensure fonts are clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Use basic colors such as blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Generally, a resume should be "relatively boring" in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   *Exception:* If you are a graphic designer or in a creative field, a more creative approach might be expected, but avoid templates designed by other graphic designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### 2. Incorrect Contact Information Formatting

[!WARNING|Mistake]
Placing contact information horizontally on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) typically do not read horizontal layouts well and may struggle to parse the information correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. If you frequently have to manually enter your name, phone number, or address when applying for jobs, your resume may not be ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

[!TIP|Solution]
Format your contact information vertically so ATS systems can find and correctly input the details into the right fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is a "quality of life hack" to speed up applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### 3. Summarizing Everything Instead of Profiling

[!WARNING|Mistake]
Writing a resume as a comprehensive summary of every career accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This approach hopes that an employer will find something they like within a broad overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

[!TIP|Solution]
Think about "profiling" your resume for a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Focus on delivering exactly what the employer is looking for, rather than including accomplishments irrelevant to the hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### 4. Lack of Resume Customization

[!WARNING|Mistake]
Being "lazy" about customizing your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. In today's competitive job market, especially for coveted remote roles, a generic resume won't stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Approaching your job search like it's 2018 is ineffective due to market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This falls under the general category of [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid | common resume mistakes to avoid]].

[!TIP|Solution]
Customizing your resume is a crucially important step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. While it may feel uncomfortable, getting into the habit of customizing gives you a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### 5. Being Overly Wordy or Using Large Blocks of Text

[!WARNING|Mistake]
Creating resumes with large blocks of text that are difficult to scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers may skip over resumes that are too wordy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

[!TIP|Solution]
Be concise and selective with your words and how they are laid out on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Format content to be easily scannable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### 6. Using Proprietary Language

[!WARNING|Mistake]
Including proprietary language such as unique project names, division names, or product types known only by your current company and co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The open market will not understand these terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

[!TIP|Solution]
Boil down concepts into clear, common language that is understood within the industry you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### 7. Including Generic "Fluffy" Terminology

[!WARNING|Mistake]
Using generic terms like "I'm a team player" or "I have great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Such phrases often make recruiters and hiring managers "roll their eyes" because these competencies are usually assessed during an interview anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

[!TIP|Solution]
Focus on more actionable terms and concepts related to the job you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job, not to impress with elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### 8. Being Stubborn and Not Revising

[!WARNING|Mistake]
If your resume isn't working, refusing to redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Repeated rejections at the application level, especially when you feel you're a clear fit, indicate that your resume is not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This is a common pitfall that can prevent job seekers from avoiding [[common_career_mistakes_to_avoid | common career mistakes to avoid]].

[!TIP|Solution]
Apply the "plan, do, check, and adjust" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. If your resume isn't yielding results, make changes and try different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're applying to by closely examining the job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Your resume must clearly convey your fit to maximize your chances of getting into the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

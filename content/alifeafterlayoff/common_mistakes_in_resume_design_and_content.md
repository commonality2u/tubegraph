As a recruiter and career coach, Brian from Life After Layoff observes many resumes and notes that many job seekers need assistance with their resume presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The goal of these tips is to help resumes "not suck" and enable candidates to put their best foot forward to land more job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

While there isn't one "right" way to write a resume, the litmus test is whether your resume is getting the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The approach shared comes from a corporate recruiter's perspective, focusing on how recruiters and hiring managers quickly screen resumes, often giving them only a 5-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The ultimate aim is to capture attention quickly and secure a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Resume Design Errors

*   **Using Outdated or Overly Designed Templates**
    Many templates, especially those found on sites like Canva.com or large resume hubs, are designed by graphic designers and include graphics, charts, and "cute" presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These designs often distract from the resume's purpose, which is for recruiters to quickly find essential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It's generally recommended to use a very simple template, such as one from Microsoft Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Bright and Flashy Colors/Graphics**
    Avoid bright and flashy colors and graphics unless you are a graphic designer or in a creative field where such an approach is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. For most professions, a resume should be "relatively boring" in its aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Multiple Columns**
    Templates with multiple columns should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Unclean or Hard-to-Read Fonts**
    Ensure that the fonts used are very clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Contact Information**
    Graphic designer templates often fail because they don't account for how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) parse resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. A common mistake is placing contact information horizontally, which ATS systems typically do not read well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Contact information should be vertical to allow the ATS to find and correctly categorize the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If you frequently need to manually enter your name, phone number, or address when applying, your resume is likely not ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Content Pitfalls

*   **Summarizing Everything Instead of Profiling**
    Do not write your resume as a summary of every accomplishment in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Instead, think about "profiling" your resume for a specific role, delivering exactly what the employer is seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Focus only on what is relevant to the hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[importance_of_customizing_resumes | customization]]**
    Failing to customize your resume for each specific job application is a crucial mistake, especially in today's competitive job market, particularly for remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. While it may seem uncomfortable, customizing your resume provides a competitive advantage because many others will not bother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Being Too Wordy**
    Resumes that are large blocks of text are difficult to scan and often lead to recruiters and hiring managers skipping over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Be concise and selective with your words, focusing on how the information is laid out on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Using Proprietary Language**
    Avoid using proprietary language, including unique titles, project names, division names, or product types, that are only known within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Recruiters in the open market will not understand these terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Instead, convey concepts using clear and common language for the industry you are applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Generic Fluffy Terminology**
    Remove generic, fluffy terms such as "I'm a team player" or "I have great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers often roll their eyes at such phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Important competencies will be assessed during the interview, not through such vague statements on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Focus on actionable terms and concepts relevant to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job, not to impress with an elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

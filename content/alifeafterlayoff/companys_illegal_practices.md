Employees should consider leaving their job immediately if the company is engaged in illegal activities or is asking them to do something unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Illegal Practices

If a company is [[predatory_hiring_practices | breaking the law]] or instructing an employee to do so, it indicates that the organization's "moral compass" is completely directionless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Such scenarios can lead to the employee being held personally liable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Examples of illegal practices include:
*   Financial shadiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
*   Questionable environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
*   Breaking human resources laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

### What to do if you encounter illegal practices
If an employee observes illegal activities, they should first report it to their HR department or legal department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. If no action is taken and the behavior persists, it is advisable to leave the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. No job is worth risking one's professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Unsafe Practices

Companies sometimes skirt safety protocols, such as OSHA rules, often in the interest of getting a job done quickly and maximizing profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. However, safety is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. When a company asks an employee to do something unsafe or less than safe, or to disregard OSHA guidelines, it demonstrates a lack of commitment to the employee's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### What to do if you encounter unsafe practices
Employees should trust their intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. If asked to do something that doesn't feel right, concerns should be voiced to the boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. If the boss is unresponsive, the issue should be escalated to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. A responsible leader would immediately stop the work and address the concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. If the company prioritizes profit over employee life or well-being, it is absolutely worth leaving the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. No job is worth risking one's life or limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

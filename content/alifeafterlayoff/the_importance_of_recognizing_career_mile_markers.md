Everyone is bound to make a career mistake at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While advice can be shared, individuals often learn these lessons the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article, based on common career mistakes observed in coaching calls, aims to help individuals, especially those early in their careers, recognize these crucial "mile markers" to avoid significant pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The insights shared come from personal experiences and those of individuals the speaker knows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Recognizing Critical Mistakes Later in Your Career

One of the biggest lessons often learned the hard way is realizing a critical career mistake years after it occurred, potentially when it's too late to easily correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These mistakes can include:
*   Staying in a job for too long or "overstaying your welcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Not responding to a recruiter for an amazing job opportunity due to fear or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Accepting a job offer that was not the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Making a geographical move that wasn't beneficial, or conversely, not moving when it could have opened an entirely new [[aligning_job_opportunities_with_career_goals | career path]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Many people later in their careers discover they focused too long on a specific job type or career vertical that no longer resonated with them, making a change much more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. With the benefit of hindsight, it becomes easy to wish one could go back and advise a younger self to make a career change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, these insights are often not obvious until much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

In career coaching, it's common for individuals feeling stuck or unhappy with their progression to seek help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. A coach can often pinpoint the exact moment where their career went "off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It is crucial to anticipate that a future version of yourself might wish they could offer advice to your present self, particularly when contemplating a [[navigating_career_transitions_and_job_market_changes | career change]] and unsure about the timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### The Pitfalls of Loyalty and Hard Work

A common hard lesson learned is that loyalty rarely pays off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. One personal example illustrates this: staying in a role too long, being loyal to a leader and organization, and expecting to be promoted after "paying dues." This resulted in being stuck while peers progressed, leading to being four or five years behind in responsibility, level, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This highlights a failure to recognize the mile marker indicating it was time to leave and pursue a leadership career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Another related lesson is that hard work alone does not lead to promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Putting in long hours, even 12+ hours a day or on weekends, often only leads to the "dangling carrot" being pushed further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Instead, it is about working smartly on projects that are highly visible and important to leadership (your boss's boss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Advocating for yourself is critical, as no one else will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Being the "CEO of your career" involves actively marketing your effectiveness within the company and on the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This proactive approach is essential for those interested in moving up in an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### The Fleeting Nature of Skills and Contributions

While being excellent at a specific skill can be an advantage, [[understanding_job_market_dynamics_and_timing_career_moves | relevant skills]] matter more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Employers value skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. If your specialized skills are not valued in the broader industry, you can end up with a resume full of irrelevant abilities, leading to settling for lower-quality jobs and damaging your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The key is to focus on skills that are highly in demand by multiple employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Finally, a particularly painful lesson, especially relevant given recent layoffs, is that "you're only as good as what you've done last" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Previous accomplishments and goodwill built up are typically short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Senior leaders prioritize future contributions over past ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to act as the "free agent of your career" and prioritize your own interests, developing all necessary skills to do so smartly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

By keeping an eye out for these crucial mile markers, you can avoid significant pain and navigate your career more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

When facing a difficult job search, job seekers might be tempted to embellish their resumes to gain an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While outright lying is strongly discouraged, there are certain "white lies" or ways to "massage" your resume that may optimize your chances of getting noticed by a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, especially given that recruiters often give resumes only a five-second glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The goal is to position yourself advantageously without fabricating your past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Acceptable "White Lies" or Resume Adjustments

The speaker, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, suggests that the following minor adjustments may be acceptable:

### 1. Job Titles
It can be acceptable to change a proprietary job title to match a more common or generic market title if the responsibilities are essentially the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This helps your resume appear more relevant to what companies are actively seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Recruiters typically won't verify the exact internal job title with your previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This falls under [[customizing_your_resume_for_specific_job_applications | customizing your resume for specific job applications]] and [[optimizing_and_customizing_your_resume | optimizing and customizing your resume]].

### 2. Company Name for Contractors
If you worked for a specific company through a third-party contracting agency, but you primarily supported that "alpha" company, had their email address, were part of their team, and your day-to-day boss was from that main company, it's generally acceptable to list the main company on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This can make your resume look better than listing an unknown third-party agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. However, be prepared to explain the contractual arrangement if background checks reveal the third-party agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 3. Location
If you are planning to move to a new area and are targeting jobs there, it might be acceptable to state that you already live in that location on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Be Prepared to Fund Your Own Move
> If you claim local residency, you must be prepared to move without any relocation assistance from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Springing relocation needs on a company during the offer process is considered unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> and could even lead to you losing out on a potential relocation package they might have offered if they knew you were out-of-area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### 4. Dates of Employment
Instead of specific months and days, using only the years of employment can "massage" your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This can make your work history appear cleaner and more desirable, especially if you have [[challenges_with_job_hopping and resume instability | job hopping]] or employment gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. While not technically lying, you're not broadcasting specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, be honest if a recruiter asks for specific dates during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### 5. Skills (Minor & Easily Acquired)
It may be acceptable to claim a skill you don't yet possess if it is:
*   Common in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   Easily learned quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   Something you can realistically learn before your potential start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
For example, if you've only used Microsoft Word but a job requires Google Docs, it's likely fine to claim Google Docs proficiency as the learning curve is small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This relates to the [[importance_of_matching_resume_experience_to_actual_skills | importance of matching resume experience to actual skills]].

### 6. Explaining Departures
It's advisable not to openly advertise on your resume that you were fired, laid off, or quit a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. If an application asks why you left a position, you might leave it blank or use a generic phrase like "better opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This prevents immediate disqualification, as recruiters often judge candidates who state they were fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. If directly asked in an interview, you should be honest but have a well-crafted explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This is part of [[advice_for_handling_previous_employment_issues_on a resume | advice for handling previous employment issues on a resume]].

## Situations Where You Should NEVER Lie

Outright lying on an application, which is considered a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, is a terminable offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Job offers can be rescinded, and employees have been terminated upon discovery of falsified information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. These are common resume mistakes to avoid.

### 1. Company You Worked For (If Never Employed)
Do not claim to have worked for a company if you never actually did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This will be exposed during the interview or background check process, leading to disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### 2. References
Never ask a friend to pretend to be a former boss or provide a fake reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. It is better to explain why you might not be on good terms with a previous boss and offer an alternative reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### 3. Specific Dates of Employment (Adding Years)
While vague dates (years only) might be acceptable, do not add a year or two to your employment history to cover gaps or inflate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This is a direct falsification and will be caught in background checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### 4. Major Skills
Do not lie about possessing major, difficult-to-acquire skills, such as a specific computer programming language, if you don't have them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. You will be exposed during the interview process, and even if you somehow got the job, you would be set up to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This is crucial for [[avoiding_common_resume_mistakes | avoiding common resume mistakes]].

### 5. Education
Never lie about having a degree or certification you don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Educational claims are routinely verified during background checks, and falsifying them will result in an offer being lost and you being blacklisted from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### 6. Criminal Record
Do not omit or lie about a criminal record, especially a felony, if specifically asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Background checks will reveal this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. It's better to be honest and explain the situation rather than risk immediate disqualification for lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

### 7. Years of Experience
Do not inflate your years of experience to meet job requirements, e.g., claiming five years when you only have two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. You will be exposed in interviews, and if hired, you will be set up to fail in a role for which you are underqualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. It's better to find a role that aligns with your actual experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Conclusion
The overarching principle is that while it's sometimes acceptable to "massage" or omit certain truths to make your resume more palatable for an initial recruiter call, you should never flat-out lie or falsify information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Your goal is to get the interview, where you can then sell yourself and explain any nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

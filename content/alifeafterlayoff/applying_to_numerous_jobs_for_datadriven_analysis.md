A video creator from the YouTube channel "Logical Finance" conducted an experiment applying for a thousand jobs to investigate claims of a labor market shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This endeavor was undertaken to determine the actual state of the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A corporate recruiter, Brian from "Life After Layoff," reacted to this experiment, offering insights from a recruiter's perspective and highlighting areas for improvement in the [[job_seeking_tools_and_platforms | job search]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Current Labor Market Conditions

The labor market is currently very difficult from a recruiting perspective, particularly for skilled labor and professional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Industries like retail, heavy industry, and trucking are struggling to find people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The software space is described as very competitive, with a general difficulty in finding candidates for highly technical jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Positions in sales, business development, and finance are reportedly easier to find candidates for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Experiment Methodology and Recruiter Commentary

The experiment involved applying to 1,000 jobs, a "super dedicated" effort, especially for someone not a career expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Resume Creation and [[Resume optimization for job search | Optimization]]

The experimenter purchased a resume template from Etsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
However, a corporate recruiter advises against buying resume templates from sites like Etsy or Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

> [00:03:57] "the resumes that they provide are designed by a graphic designer and it's not to mean that a graphic designer can't design a very beautiful resume... but as the job seeker we want to give ourselves the best chance of getting noticed by the recruiter"

Resumes from graphic designers are often designed for aesthetics rather than functionality and discoverability by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Recruiters search through ATS systems using boolean search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Resumes with excessive graphics or columns can render applicants "essentially invisible" to ATS, making manual data entry necessary during application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. If an applicant finds themselves doing a lot of manual data entry after uploading a resume, it's a strong indicator that their resume is not ATS-compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

#### Objective Statements vs. Career Summaries
The experimenter questioned the usefulness of objective statements or profile sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. A recruiter agrees that objective statements are often unnecessary but recommends a career summary to help quickly brand or profile the candidate to a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

#### Customization
For the experiment, the creator intentionally did as little resume customization as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. However, a recruiter states that customizing a resume is the single most impactful action a job seeker can take to increase callback chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The lack of customization and potentially problematic resume titling were cited as reasons for skepticism about the experiment's results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

#### Multiple Resume Versions
The experiment utilized four different resume versions: two base templates (A and B), each with a college and a high school diploma version, and different work experience (retailer vs. restaurant chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Having multiple versions of a resume is recommended, especially for those with multiple career verticals, to niche down and be specific for better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Application Process

#### [[Overly demanding job application processes | Overly Demanding Processes]]
The experiment highlighted [[applicant_frustrations_with_job_search_strategies | applicant frustrations with job search strategies]], such as being asked to tell a joke during an application, which adds an unnecessary layer of anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Even more frustrating are assessment tests that can turn a 2-3 minute application into a 15-20 minute ordeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. A recruiter strongly advises employers against requiring assessment tests at the application level due to a terrible candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Many candidates, including the recruiter, would abandon an application that requires an assessment test, feeling their time is not valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

#### [[Job seeking tools and platforms | Job Search Methods]]
The experimenter used two primary methods for applying:
1.  Directly visiting the career sites of S&P 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This is considered a good method as company websites usually have the most accurate job lists, unlike job boards that may not always pull down filled or canceled positions promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
2.  [[Using job boards effectively | Using job boards effectively]] like Indeed and CareerBuilder to find companies and then going directly to their websites to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Applying directly through the company website is generally preferred by recruiters as it's often a compliance requirement anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

#### "Entry-Level" Job Experience Meme
The experiment also sampled 50 "entry-level" jobs to check the common meme about such roles requiring 3-5 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Out of 21 jobs specifically labeled "entry-level," only two required experience, and six preferred it; the rest did not mention experience or explicitly stated none was required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. A recruiter clarifies that "entry-level" classifications on job boards are often due to automated AI issues from ATS systems rather than human error, and job seekers should rely more on the job posting's detailed description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. It is better to search by job title than by experience level, as jobs might be miscategorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

## Results of the Experiment

After applying to 1,003 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>:
*   **Interview Requests**: 259 (25.8% response rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Flat-out Rejections**: 47 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Unknown Calls**: 87 (potential interviews, but excluded due to spam possibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   **No Response**: Approximately 650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

A recruiter found the 27-28% response rate "really good," especially considering the use of a template site and no customization for entry-level, relatively low-paying positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This suggests that companies are "desperate for labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

### Reasons for No Response
Lack of response after 10 days doesn't necessarily mean a candidate is no longer considered; jobs might be filled, the candidate might not be a good fit, or recruiters may be overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Recruiters are often handling a high volume of requisitions (e.g., 30-50 per recruiter for sourcing roles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

### Resume Performance
Resume B significantly outperformed Resume A, receiving a 30% response rate compared to Resume A's 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. The exact reason for the difference (content, layout) was not determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The results indicate that the entry-level [[job_seeking_tools_and_platforms | job market]] was strong at the time of the video, with approximately a third of applications resulting in interview requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. This suggests a "job seekers' buying market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

For job seekers who are dissatisfied with their current employment, this period represents "the best time" to be looking for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. It's recommended to explore opportunities, as the favorable market conditions may not last indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
[[navigating_job_offers_and_employment_strategies | Navigating job offers and employment strategies]] is critical in this environment.

Asking insightful questions during a job interview is a critical component of [[role_of_interview_skills_in_getting_hired | interview skills]] that benefits both the candidate and the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It demonstrates a candidate's engagement and allows them to effectively screen the opportunity for a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Why Asking Questions is Crucial

Recruiters, drawing from over 20 years of experience, consistently hear from hiring managers that a lack of questions from candidates indicates a lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Asking questions satisfies the interviewer by showing curiosity about the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Beyond impressing the interviewer, candidates should use the interview to screen the company and the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Accepting a "bad job" can set back a career by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Therefore, the interview should be a two-way street, where candidates actively interview the company as much as they are being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The most effective candidates often make the interviewer feel like they are being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Key Areas to Screen Through Questions

When [[preparing_questions_for_interviewers | preparing questions for interviewers]], focus on areas that provide insights into the role's dynamics, departmental needs, leadership style, and company stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Understanding the Role's Purpose
*   **Why is this position open?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
    *   This reveals the department's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. If the previous person was terminated, laid off, or quit, it prompts further inquiry into the reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. If it's an added headcount, it suggests department or company growth, which is a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **What is your vision for this role?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
    *   Asking this early can provide an advantage, allowing candidates to tailor their answers to align with the hiring manager's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
    *   This helps determine if expectations are reasonable and if the candidate can be set up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Unreasonable expectations can lead to turnover and indicate a [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **What made the previous person so successful in this role?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
    *   This provides a roadmap for success if the candidate gets the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Assessing Department Strengths and Weaknesses
*   **What is one weakness you currently have in your department?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
    *   This helps a candidate understand where their skills might fit in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **How do you see this role contributing to solving some of those weaknesses or accentuating strengths?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
    *   Allows the candidate to determine if they align with the proposed contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Understanding Career Growth and Leadership
*   **Where do you see potential growth opportunities in the long term?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   While not immediately asking about promotions, it's reasonable for a candidate to understand their long-term career path and avoid a "dead end" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **What would you describe your leadership style as?** or **If I was to ask your direct reports how they would describe you as a leader, what do you think they would say?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   This helps candidates vet their potential boss and ensure alignment with their leadership style for a long-term fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. It also provides insight into the manager's [[selfawareness_in_job_interviews | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Evaluating Organizational Strategy and Stability
*   **How is this company planning to address new industry developments or competitors, and stay in front of the market?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
    *   This question is vital for understanding the organization's strategic direction, ensuring longevity and stability, and avoiding companies on "shaky ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. A lack of strategic awareness can be a [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **If you have one concern that keeps you up at night, whether it's in your department or with the company, what would that be?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
    *   This question can provide significant insight into the true behind-the-scenes concerns of the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Engaging Throughout the Interview

While it's customary for interviewers to ask "Do you have any questions for me?" at the end, candidates should feel free to engage the interviewer throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This creates a two-way dialogue, which is the best way to ace an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. By [[formulating_questions_to_ask_interviewers | formulating questions to ask interviewers]] that are pertinent to the opportunity, candidates demonstrate engagement and gather crucial information before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

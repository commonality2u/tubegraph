Recent surveys and observations indicate a significant cultural disconnect between [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Generation Z]] employees, particularly recent college graduates, and the expectations of employers in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This has led to high rates of termination for this demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## High Termination Rates for Recent Graduates

A survey conducted by Intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders involved in hiring decisions, found that 75% of companies had hired [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Shockingly, six out of ten companies admitted to having fired a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This trend suggests that employers are quick to fire perceived cultural mismatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The most frequently cited [[reasons_for_firing_gen_z_employees | reasons for firing Gen Z employees]] include:

*   Challenges with feedback or not taking feedback well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Lack of relevant work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> (despite being entry-level positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   Poor problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Insufficient technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Bad culture fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Difficulty working in a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

Hiring managers also hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>:
*   **Entitlement:** Around 65-70% believe Gen Z is entitled, often seeking rapid promotions without demonstrated skill or experience, and desiring high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Easily Offended:** Approximately 65% perceive them as easily offended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of Work Ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

About 19% reported inappropriate language use at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, and 17% found them difficult to manage or prone to handing in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Some employers have become so discouraged that one in seven companies may avoid hiring any college graduates in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Perceived Disconnect from Education

The speaker suggests that universities are not adequately preparing students for the realities of the modern workplace, leading to a significant cultural disconnect and insufficient transition training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. For example, a surprising 28% of employers reported a lack of technological skills in Gen Z hires, despite this generation growing up with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Issues like late assignment submissions from university life translate poorly to workplace punctuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Case Studies of [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] Behavior

Several real-world examples and anecdotes from employers highlight specific behaviors contributing to the cultural mismatch:

*   **Construction Company Owner's Observations:** A construction company owner in Southern California described young people under 30 as entitled, uneducated, lacking communication skills, critical thinking, and motivation, and requiring constant supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. They also noted zero attention to detail, frustration with persistence, and inability to separate from phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Emergency Department Nurse:** A new nurse graduate was constantly on her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and texted friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. When her phone was locked away, she threw a tantrum and ultimately chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This incident led the department to stop hiring new nurse graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Government IT Professional:** A government IT division hired several computer science graduates for entry-level IT admin positions, none of whom lasted more than six months due to lack of focus, attention, communication skills, urgency, and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Tik Tok Case Studies:**
    *   **Multiple Firings for Phone Use/Lack of Engagement:** One woman recounted being fired from two accounting roles within the same year. Her first firing was due to excessive phone use because the job was "boring," and the company culture felt like "high school" with "snitches" and micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. She expressed not caring about being fired.
    *   **Misunderstanding Contract Terms and Social Issues:** In her second accounting role, she was fired after a colleague reported her for coming in "whenever she felt like it," despite her contract allowing flexible hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. She admitted to disliking interacting with that specific colleague.
    *   **Punctuality and Responsibility Issues:** A recording of an HR termination call revealed an employee, Tatiana, being fired for consistent tardiness (12, 21, and 32 minutes late) and a "no call, no show" on her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Her excuses and lack of understanding regarding the impact on coworkers demonstrated a "sense of entitlement" and "lack of responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
    *   **"Quiet Quitting" Extreme:** One Gen Z individual bragged on TikTok about not doing "anything for 15 months" before getting caught and fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This behavior, often termed "quiet quitting," is no longer tolerated in a competitive job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

### The Impact of Social Media
The rise of social media is seen as a contributing factor to [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] workplace issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Employers actively check social media profiles before hiring to assess cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Posting about slacking off at work or failing to separate personal life from professional conduct is viewed negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Constant phone use and the need for "instant feedback" or "dopamine hits" from social media are believed to shorten attention spans and hinder focus in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Avoiding political topics at work is also emphasized, as political views can lead to termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

It is important to proactively manage one's career by regularly engaging in job search activities, even when satisfied with a current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This approach helps individuals act like the CEO of their career, or a free agent, by staying informed about the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## The Risk of Complacency and Market Stagnation

Staying in a job for too long can lead to the market passing you by, impacting both career progression and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Underpayment and Counter-offers
An individual who had spent seven to eight years with their employer, despite being a top performer and having received promotions, found themselves significantly underpaid compared to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. After receiving an external job offer that paid $5 more an hour, their current employer provided a counter-offer of a $15 an hour raise to retain them due to high departmental turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This suggests the employee was likely underpaid to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Pay Philosophy
Companies generally fall into two categories regarding pay philosophy:
*   **Pay Leaders:** These companies aim to retain talent and can poach from competitors by offering higher compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pay Laggers:** These companies may factor turnover into their business model, not prioritizing competitive pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

While some companies might not immediately address pay disparities, failing to retain intellectual and tribal knowledge, as well as skills, through constant replacement, becomes more expensive due to recruiting and training costs, and the loss of experienced personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Wage Stagnation
Internal salary growth, often through small incremental cost-of-living adjustments (1-3% raises) or occasional promotional bonuses (5-10%), may not keep pace with the external market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This can result in new hires with less experience earning the same or more than long-term employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Many departments can be 20-30% below market rate, and unless employees actively test the market, companies may not proactively adjust their pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### [[importance_of_networking_in_job_searching | Testing the Open Market]] Regularly
It is a crucial [[effective_job_search_strategies | strategy]] for everyone to [[effective_job_search_strategies | test the open market]] at least once every two years, even if satisfied with their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This involves:
*   Submitting applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   [[networking_for_job_seekers | Networking]] with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Monitoring market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Participating in interview processes to understand current skill demands and assessment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Reaching the offer stage to assess if your current compensation is competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Navigating Counter Offers
While using external offers to negotiate raises can be effective, it should be done selectively, as companies may eventually call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Accepting a counter offer might be a difficult decision, but a significant raise (e.g., $15 an hour) coupled with existing equity, vested vacation time, and familiar work processes can be compelling reasons to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

However, accepting a counter-offer is generally not recommended as it often indicates you were underpaid in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The job market is constantly changing, making it essential to stay informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

When considering a career transition, it's common to find yourself in a situation where you're unhappy at work and begin exploring new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Reasons for this dissatisfaction can include feeling underappreciated or underpaid, being passed over for a promotion, or simply being completely overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. After searching and landing an offer for a new position, your current company may respond with a counteroffer, promising a new job title and a bigger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Why You Should Never Accept a Counteroffer

A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises against accepting a counteroffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While deciding between a new opportunity and a counteroffer can be stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, data and real-life experience strongly suggest declining counteroffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

According to LinkedIn, an overwhelming majority of people who accept counteroffers will not be with their company after a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   **80% or more** won't be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **93%** won't be with their current company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Core Issues Persist

The primary reason not to accept a counteroffer is that the issues that initially drove you to look for a new job will likely still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>:
*   A bad boss will remain a bad boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Poor company culture will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Work-life balance problems won't disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   An unpleasant commute or terrible benefits will remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

If you've reached the point of considering another offer, it's typically for a good reason, and you should keep your options open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Companies can lay off long-tenured employees with little to no warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Leaving a bad boss, poor work culture, or a dying industry is not just the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do for your [[career_development_skills_and_resources | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Why Do Companies Counter?

Ask yourself why your current employer is countering only now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Essentially, they were undervaluing you until you decided or threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This could indicate they took you for granted or were caught off guard without a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Often, a counteroffer is a tactic to buy themselves time to replace you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Impact on Relationships and Job Security

Accepting a counteroffer can significantly impact your relationships and job security within the company:
*   **Changed Relationships** Your relationships will likely not be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Redundancy Planning** Your employer will likely begin searching for your replacement, developing a plan to transfer your knowledge, and creating a contingency in case you do leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. You've effectively made yourself redundant in their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Labelled as Dissatisfied** You'll be labeled as someone not long-term committed to the business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. When the company faces difficulties, you might be among the first considered for layoffs, especially if you now have a higher salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Undervaluation** If they gave you a promotion or raise, question why it wasn't offered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Sometimes, highly effective employees are "locked" into their roles because management doesn't want to lose them, hindering their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It shouldn't take threatening to leave for your contributions to be recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Career Prospects** Even with a promised promotion, senior leaders may view you as less dedicated, passing on you for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The promised role may just be to keep you happy temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### The "Honeymoon Period" is Temporary

While workplace conditions might improve initially, there's usually a "honeymoon period" that eventually wears off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. When it does, you'll likely face the same issues that motivated your job search in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Even if you get a new role and boss, you'll still work alongside the old boss you threatened to quit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

> "It's sort of like an old relationship... look back on it fondly but remember that it ended for a reason. And look forward to new beginnings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

### Real-Life Example

One individual accepted a counteroffer after having already moved halfway across the country for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Despite being told it was a mistake, they turned around and returned to their old company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Less than six months later, they called, admitting it was a big mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

A recent viral TikTok highlighted a significant [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_employers | cultural mismatch]] between recent college graduates and the realities of a 9-to-5 job in the [[challenges_in_the_modern_workplace | modern workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident brought to light the [[expectations_versus_reality_of_9_to_5_jobs_for_new_graduates | stark contrast]] between the limited responsibilities of college life and the demanding nature of professional careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Reality Check for New Graduates

Many new graduates, particularly [[challenges_faced_by_gen_z_in_the_workplace | Gen Z]], are reportedly less prepared for the structured and often demanding nature of the professional world compared to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The TikTok user, a recent college graduate in her first 9-to-5 job, expressed significant distress over her daily routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Challenges of a Full-Time Commute

She detailed a long commute that significantly impacted her personal time and energy:
> "I get on the train at 7:30 and I don't get home till like 6:15 earliest and then like I don't have time to do anything I don't I want to shower eat my dinner and go to sleep I don't have time or energy to cook by dinner either like I don't have energy to work out like that's out the window like I'm so upset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

This sentiment highlights a common complaint among new employees regarding the time commitment and exhaustion associated with traditional office jobs, especially with long commutes in large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The speaker acknowledges this as a common reality of full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Remote work is seen as an attractive alternative due to its potential to eliminate commute times, though it often leads to longer working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## The Harsh Realities of the [[Current challenges in the job market | Job Market]]

The TikToker's experience took a turn when she was laid off from her first post-graduate job, which she had spent five months finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This situation underscored the [[financial_challenges_and_job_instability_faced_by_new_graduates | financial challenges and job instability]] faced by new graduates entering a volatile job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Financial Strain and Job Search Difficulties

She further revealed significant financial struggles:
> "Job that I was working 9 to5 from I wasn't making enough to live I didn't I wasn't making enough to live I didn't I don't have a savings because of that job like the salaries that people are making with a degree right now after college is just not okay we're working so much and I still don't have an emergency fund I don't because I wasn't making enough to save any of it everything was going towards living and expenses and commuting and everything else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>

Her frustration extended to the job search process, noting that hiring slows down significantly during the holiday season and doesn't fully pick up until mid to late January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Despite having a degree, two internships, a portfolio, and freelance experience, she felt her efforts were "still not enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### The Value of a College Degree

The discussion raised questions about the viability of a college education given the high debt and often insufficient starting salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that new graduates often face "extraordinary amount of debt" without commensurate earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Side Hustles as a Solution
> To combat financial instability and gain more control, developing side income streams or "side hustles" is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This proactive approach can reduce dependency on a single employer and provide financial flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Navigating the Future of Work

The [[decline_of_traditional_careers | modern workforce]] is undergoing significant changes, and new generations are expected to bring about further transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. While there is a recognized [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_employers | disconnect]] between traditional work expectations and the aspirations of new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, proactive career planning is crucial.

> [!TIP] Strategic Career Planning
> Early career strategy is vital for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Instead of "winging it," a strategic approach can help individuals navigate their careers, potentially allowing them to avoid the traditional 9-to-5 grind or achieve early retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Taking control of one's career means being proactive and motivated, even if it requires hard work outside of a traditional 9-to-5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Job offers are frequently contingent upon the successful completion of a background check, which often includes a criminal background check [00:00:48]. Candidates are typically required to authorize the company to conduct this check after signing an offer letter [00:01:39]. Employers often outsource the background check process to specialized third-party companies [00:01:00].

## What Employers Look For

Criminal background checks primarily focus on:
*   **Felonies** A felony conviction is a serious criminal conviction and can be a significant barrier to employment for many companies [00:04:14]. If a felony occurred more than seven years prior, it may still be flagged, requiring the employer to decide whether to proceed with the offer [00:04:43].
*   **Misdemeanors** These are less serious criminal convictions and generally do not prevent a candidate from getting a job [00:04:23]. However, the specific nature of the misdemeanor is considered on a case-by-case basis [00:04:30]. The human resources department makes the final decision [00:04:34].
*   **Pending Court Cases** Employers also check for any pending court cases [00:04:37].
*   **Active Warrants** The criminal background check can identify active warrants [00:05:27].
*   **Juvenile Infractions** Criminal background checks typically do not report on juvenile infractions [00:05:39].

## Verification Process and Timeframe

To verify a candidate's criminal history, third-party companies will look at all the locations where the candidate has lived for a specified period [00:05:05]. They then contact the local courthouses in each of those areas [00:05:09]. Delays in this process are usually due to the courthouses, especially if they have antiquated, non-electronic systems [00:05:13]. Generally, criminal background checks go back approximately seven years [00:04:41].

## Importance of Disclosure

It is always advisable for a candidate to disclose any criminal background at the time of the job offer [00:04:50]. This ensures transparency, prevents surprises, and allows the employer to be fully aware before conducting the background check [00:04:54]. Honesty is crucial, as the job application is considered a legal document [00:07:01]. If an employer discovers a discrepancy or falsified information, even after employment, it can lead to termination for cause [00:07:04]. An offer could be rescinded if a candidate is found to have lied [00:07:27].

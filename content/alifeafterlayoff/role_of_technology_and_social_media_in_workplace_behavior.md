The integration of technology and social media into daily life has significantly impacted workplace behavior, particularly among recent college graduates and younger generations. While these tools offer connectivity and information, their misuse or inappropriate application in a professional setting can lead to significant challenges for employees and employers alike.

## Key Behavioral Concerns Related to Technology and Social Media

Surveys and employer feedback highlight several issues attributed to the pervasive presence of technology and social media in the workplace:

*   **Excessive Phone Use**
    *   A significant complaint from employers is the inability of some young employees to disengage from their phones during work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This constant engagement, including [[social_media_impact_on_professional_reputations | scrolling TikTok]], is seen as a symptom of a need for constant "dopamine hits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, leading to incredibly short attention spans where focus on work for more than 10 minutes becomes "literally impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   One case study describes an accounting role where an employee was frequently on her phone due to boredom, despite warnings, eventually leading to management physically moving her desk to monitor her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Another instance involves a nurse who "would not stay off of her phone, ignored her assignments and patients," and was even texting friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This behavior led to her phone being locked away, and ultimately, she chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Inappropriate Social Media Content**
    *   There's a growing trend of employees posting "everything and anything on their TikToks and Instagrams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This includes [[recording_workplace_interactions | recording and bragging about slacking off at work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Many younger generations, potentially due to growing up with social media, haven't learned to "separate the two" — personal life from professional settings – leading to a lack of discretion in sharing personal information publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19]">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Employer Perspectives and Expectations

Employers are increasingly scrutinizing candidates' and employees' online presence.

*   **Social Media Checks During Hiring:** Employers actively search social media profiles before hiring to ensure a candidate would fit the team's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Impact on Professionalism:** The lack of distinction between personal and professional online behavior can negatively affect an employee's [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professional reputation]] and the employer's perception of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Surprising Lack of Technical Skills:** Despite growing up with advanced technology like iPads and iPhones, a survey indicated that 28% of employers reported a lack of technological skills among recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This suggests a disconnect between casual tech familiarity and the specific technical proficiencies required in the workplace.

## Broader Implications

The challenges related to technology and social media use in the workplace contribute to broader concerns about [[challenges_faced_by_gen_z_in_the_workplace | Generation Z's readiness for the workforce]] and the [[shifting_dynamics_and_expectations_in_the_modern_workplace | shifting dynamics and expectations in the modern workplace]]. The observed behaviors can also impact [[impact_of_workplace_culture_on_job_satisfaction | workplace culture]], creating environments where "snitching" on phone use is prevalent, as described by one Gen Z employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

While some of these issues are attributed to a "few bad apples" rather than an entire generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, the collective perception among employers is leading to hesitations in hiring recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This underscores the importance of demonstrating appropriate technology use and [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professionalism]] in an increasingly digital work environment.

Being excessively loyal at work can prove very costly for an individual's career [00:00:00]. While traditional wisdom, instilled by previous generations, suggests that loyalty to a company "to a fault" is a positive trait to strive for, the reality of the recent labor market reveals that loyalty can be a one-way street, not always benefiting the employee [00:00:22].

## The Story of Bob: A Cautionary Tale
Consider the example of Bob, who spent 20 years in the same job, company, and division [00:01:14]. He was a well-liked "steady Eddie," comfortable in his role, with no high [[the_importance_of_career_planning | career aspirations]] to climb the corporate ladder [00:01:21]. Bob consistently delivered solid contributions, earning regular performance appraisals that were "spectacularly steady" and yearly merit raises of 1-3%, along with performance bonuses [00:01:54].

### The Unexpected Layoff
After 21 years, Bob was abruptly laid off, being told his position was affected due to business changes [00:02:23]. He was in shock, believing they had the wrong person because he was such a long-term, steady performer [00:02:54]. His company quickly escorted him out, his computer and badge already deactivated [00:03:32].

### Struggles in the Job Market
Thrust into an unwanted [[strategies_for_job_searching_and_career_advancement | job search]], Bob struggled, despite nearly 30 years of industry experience [00:03:50]. His phone wasn't ringing, and the few interviews he secured were for lower-quality roles with worse pay and benefits [00:04:10]. He found that the best employers in his industry were demanding skills he lacked, specifically exposure to technology, software, and processes his previous company hadn't valued [00:04:36]. Bob realized he was "hopelessly out of date" and the market had passed him by [00:04:55].

## The Hidden Costs of Not Updating Skills

### Skill Obsolescence
Fifteen years into Bob's career, a disruptive technology emerged that split the market [00:05:13]. His company stuck with an older technology it was comfortable with, which was no longer the industry standard [00:05:24]. Bob was apathetic, as he had a steady paycheck, and neither he nor his company saw value in upgrading his skills [00:05:32]. Bob's critical mistake was failing to [[importance_of_staying_current_with_skills_in_tech | keep current on the skills]] himself, assuming his 20 years of loyalty made him immune to layoff [00:05:44]. Employers demand current skills, and even a well-optimized resume is ineffective without them [00:06:08].

### Wage Stagnation
Bob also learned he had fallen far behind on wages [00:06:18]. His modest merit increases, just keeping pace with inflation, meant that entry-level employees in his field were earning nearly the same as him, only $5,000 to $7,000 less, despite his two decades of experience [00:06:26]. Salary research revealed he was underpaid by nearly $20,000 compared to market rates [00:06:44].

## Strategies for Career Advancement and Job Security

### Act Like a Free Agent
Individuals should always operate like a "free agent," constantly monitoring the current market, employer demands, and acquiring the latest, most up-to-date skills to keep their resume marketable [00:07:07]. While not operating out of fear of job elimination, it's crucial to be prepared for corporate downsizing, layoffs, or the emergence of better opportunities [00:07:25]. Even if your current employer doesn't value new skills or methodologies, other employers likely will [00:07:44].

### Monitor Wage Data
Regularly assess your market value by checking wage data at least once every two years [00:07:57]. This helps understand where you stand within broader industry ranges and allows for [[the_importance_of_being_a_proactive_career_planner | proactive steps]] to address wage gaps where you are, or to prepare for a move to achieve desired compensation [00:08:08].

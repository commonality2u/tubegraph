Career cushioning is the latest employment trend, representing a proactive approach to protecting one's career against potential job loss or market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. It emphasizes taking steps to ensure a softer landing if an individual experiences an "unplanned income disruption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## The Evolution of Employment Trends

To understand the emergence of career cushioning, it's helpful to review recent shifts in the employment market:
*   **The Great Resignation** Following a major economic downturn in 2020 due to the pandemic, many employers made "knee-jerk reactions" and laid off employees, causing remaining staff to take on increased work burdens and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This led to widespread burnout, prompting individuals to reevaluate their careers and ultimately resign in large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. During this period, the pendulum of power swung heavily towards the job seeker, creating a "Heyday of job seeking" with abundant opportunities and raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Quiet Quitting** As the job market favored employees, some individuals chose to "quiet quit" rather than leave, opting to do the bare minimum necessary without taking on additional responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Quiet Firing** The pendulum began to swing back towards employers, who, instead of outright firing employees, started encouraging them to quit through neglect or lack of advancement opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## The Current Landscape (December 2022)

As of December 2022, the labor market remains shaky and is increasingly moving towards an uncertain environment, with the pendulum of power swinging back towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While the overall labor market shows signs of strength, certain industries, particularly tech, have been severely impacted by layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

A study of 722 executives by PricewaterhouseCoopers revealed that 50% of respondents were reducing their overall headcount, even while expressing concern about their ability to hire and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Companies are instituting hiring freezes, reducing headcount, lowering or dropping sign-on bonuses, and 44% are rescinding offers or canceling jobs altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. These indicators suggest a potentially rocky period ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## What is Career Cushioning?

Career cushioning involves proactively preparing for the possibility of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It can be likened to "dating cushioning," where one builds a side option to land softer during a breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. In the context of a career, it means taking proactive steps to protect oneself and ensure a smoother transition if an unexpected change occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

While labeled a new trend, the practices of career cushioning are not new; many individuals who "think like a free agent" have been engaging in these [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_resilience | strategies for job security and career resilience]] all along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Practicing career cushioning is highly recommended to [[strategies_for_career_control_and_adaptation | take control of your career trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Here are key [[strategies_for_job_security_and_skill_development | strategies for job security and skill development]] and [[strategies_for_career_management_and_networking | strategies for career management and networking]] to implement:

*   **Optimize Your Online Presence**
    *   Update and optimize your LinkedIn profile to ensure it is tidy and appealing to recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    *   Build active professional networks on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Keep Your Documents Current**
    *   Ensure your resume is current and ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This prevents scrambling during a layoff notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Monitor the Job Market**
    *   Regularly look at job postings to understand what employers are seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

    *   Take a collective look at what you truly want in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   Assess your current skills and identify any gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   Develop a plan to achieve your career aspirations while gainfully employed to reduce stress in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This helps eliminate positions that don't align with your core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

Understanding a company's turnover rates and their approach to job stability is crucial for job seekers and employees alike. It can signal the health of a corporate culture and the potential for long-term career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Assessing Turnover Rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

When evaluating a company, examine its [[high_and_excessive_turnover_rates_as_indicators_of_toxicity | turnover rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Strong companies generally do not have significant [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover issues]] because employees are satisfied and prefer to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Involuntary Turnover and Layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
Specifically, look for involuntary turnover, such as terminations or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Companies that frequently lay off staff and then rehire for those positions a few months later typically do not make great employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Such "knee-jerk reactions" can leave employees feeling constantly on edge about their job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Industry Standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
While [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover rates]] can vary by industry, the general industry standard for [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] is around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Ideally, you should aim to target companies with a [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover rate]] under 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A lower [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover rate]] is a key indicator of a positive corporate culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Investigative Research for External Candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
For external candidates, determining a company's [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover rate]] might require some investigative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Press Releases:** Check company press releases for any announcements regarding recent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Online Reviews:** Look for reviews on platforms like Glassdoor, Indeed, or Comparably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Pay attention to feedback related to job stability, management practices, and overall employee morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Consistently high ratings across various platforms are a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **On-site Observations:** If you have an on-site interview, observe the workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Do employees appear engaged and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>? Positive [[employee_satisfaction_and_career_changes | employee morale]] indicates a desirable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Job Stability

Several elements contribute to a company's ability to retain employees and offer greater job stability.

### Internal Promotion Culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
A company that actively promotes from within demonstrates a commitment to employee growth and provides clear career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Asking "Why is this position open?" during an interview can reveal this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. If the answer is due to an internal promotion, it's a very positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Companies that encourage internal movement indicate a high likelihood of career progression for dedicated employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Compensation and Benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
Companies that are "pay leaders" — meaning they strategically offer higher compensation than the market average — tend to attract and retain top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Beyond salary, a strong benefits package that includes comprehensive medical, dental, vision, 401ks, and competitive bonuses is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Companies that consistently invest in and expand their benefits packages each year are often high-quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Investment in Personal Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
Employers who invest in their employees' personal development, through training, conferences, or opportunities for stretch assignments, typically experience very low [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This commitment fosters growth and keeps employees engaged and satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Employee Recognition Programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
A great employer recognizes employee accomplishments and milestones, both professional and personal (e.g., birthdays, weddings, births) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Companies that celebrate their employees and even involve their families in events (like year-end celebrations or barbecues) contribute to a more enjoyable employment experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Work-Life Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
A company that prioritizes work-life balance ensures manageable workloads, hires adequate staff, and values employee time off for rest and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Companies expecting consistently long hours or with negative reviews regarding work-life balance should be approached with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Generous vacation policies, even for new employees, are a positive indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Transparent and Trustworthy Leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
Leadership teams that are honest, transparent, and embody the company's core values are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. If leadership says one thing but does another, it does not bode well for [[voluntary_turnover_and_company_retention | employee turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Look for companies whose senior leadership has a strong, trustworthy reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Upon receiving a job offer, companies often state that the offer is contingent upon the successful completion of a background check and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Employers typically outsource this process to third-party companies that conduct the checks on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The job application itself is a legal document, and applicants often certify that all information provided is correct and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The application becomes a permanent part of the employment record, and it usually includes a section granting the employer the right to check the applicant's background upon a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. After signing an offer letter, candidates usually complete another form authorizing the company to conduct [[criminal_background_checks | criminal background checks]], [[employment_and_job_title_verification | employment verification]], and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## How Background Checks Are Conducted

Employers utilize various resources to check backgrounds, including searching databases, verifying submitted employment records, and contacting previous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### [[employment_and_job_title_verification | Employment and Job Title Verification]]

This is a key component of the background check.
*   **Sources** The most common starting point for [[employment_and_job_title_verification | employment verification]] is "Work Number," a database where millions of employers submit employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This database can verify employment records and sometimes income, although employers generally do not check previous income as it's becoming an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal question]] in many states and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. If the database information is insufficient, the third-party company may contact the employer directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Key Information Checked** The primary details verified are that the applicant worked for the company, the dates of employment, and the [[employment_and_job_title_verification | job titles]] held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Duration** While some companies check an applicant's entire work history, most only go back approximately seven to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Accuracy of Job Titles and Dates**
    *   Minor adjustments to [[employment_and_job_title_verification | job titles]] to make them more commonly accepted or suited to the industry are usually not a major issue if they represent the same level of responsibility (e.g., "talent acquisition specialist" vs. "recruiter") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   However, changing a title to a completely different level (e.g., claiming to be a director when an individual contributor) can be a significant problem and a major red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   Falsifying dates of employment (e.g., adding extra months or a year of experience) is also not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### [[criminal_background_checks | Criminal Background Checks]]

This check typically focuses on felonies and misdemeanors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Felonies vs. Misdemeanors** Felony convictions are more serious and can often be a barrier to employment for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Misdemeanors are less serious and generally won't prevent employment, though this depends on the specific conviction and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the human resources department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Scope** Background checks also look for pending court cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. They generally go back about seven years, but felonies from earlier periods may still be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Employers must then decide whether to proceed with the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Disclosure** It is advisable to disclose any criminal background at the time of the job offer to avoid surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Verification Process** Checks involve contacting local courthouses in all locations where the applicant has lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Delays can occur if courthouses have antiquated, non-electronic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Additional Checks** [[criminal_background_checks | Criminal background checks]] can also reveal active warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Juvenile Records** Generally, [[criminal_background_checks | criminal background checks]] do not report on juvenile infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Education Verification

This component verifies that the applicant attended the claimed schools, obtained stated degrees, and holds any claimed certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Scope** This includes high school, any colleges, and professional certifications (e.g., CPA license) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Verification Process** The third-party company contacts the university or certifying body directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This process is usually quick because educational institutions are accustomed to these requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## What Happens if You Fail a Background Check?

The employer receives a detailed report from the background check company, listing verified and unverified information, noting any exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The employer may then choose to circle back with the applicant for clarification or potentially rescind the job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Proactively responding to requests for additional information is in the applicant's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Importance of Honesty

It is crucial to be honest about accomplishments and information provided on a job application because it is considered a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If an employer discovers discrepancies in credentials, even after hiring, the employee can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Falsifying information, such as having a friend or relative act as an [[employment_and_job_title_verification | employment verifier]], carries a high likelihood of a job offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Being forthcoming and ensuring your credentials match what you claim is always the recommended approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

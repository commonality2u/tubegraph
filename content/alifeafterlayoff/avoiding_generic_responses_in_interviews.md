The question "Why should we hire you?" is one of the most commonly feared questions by job seekers in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A poll among job seekers revealed it as the question they were most afraid of encountering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Recruiters ask this question to understand if a candidate grasps the position's purpose and the business problem it aims to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Why Generic Responses Are Detrimental

Many job seekers make the mistake of giving generic answers to interview questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Such responses include phrases like:
*   "I'm a team player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%" (which is physically impossible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   "I'm a fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   "I achieve results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   "I'm going to jump into your team and hit the ground running" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

These phrases are considered "fluffy" and do not provide any meaningful insight into the candidate's specific capabilities or how they can benefit the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Everyone believes they can do these things, so they don't differentiate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Strategy for Answering "Why Should We Hire You?"

To effectively answer "Why should we hire you?" and avoid generic responses, a three-part formula is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This approach ensures your answer is targeted and demonstrates your understanding of the role and the company's needs. This is a key [[strategies_for_successful_job_interview_responses | strategy for successful job interview responses]] and [[strategies_for_answering_difficult_interview_questions | answering difficult interview questions]].

### 1. Understand the Business Problem
The first part of the formula involves understanding why the position is open and the specific business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. A new position is typically created to address a business gap or problem, such as needing a new skill set, launching a new division, or managing a new project due to bandwidth limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

To uncover this information:
*   **Review the Job Description**: Pay close attention to the job description, highlighting major points that indicate what the business is looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Ask the Recruiter**: During the preliminary screen with a recruiter, ask questions about the role and listen closely to their responses. They will often provide key insights into the business needs that you can use in later interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### 2. Link Your Past Experiences to the Business Problem
Once you understand the business problem, the next step is to connect your past experiences and successes to that specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. If the position is related to a particular project, highlight how you have worked on similar projects in previous roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Frame your answer by stating, "I've already solved this problem in another organization, and this is why I think I'd be able to do it for you, because I've already had a track record of success doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### 3. Show How You Can Solve the Problem for Them
The final part is to demonstrate how you would apply your experience to solve *their* current business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. You can offer a brief outline of your approach, such as "I've worked on this type of project before; this is how I would solve it. I would do this, this, and this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This helps the interviewer visualize you in the role, actively addressing their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

By tying the business results you've achieved in the past to the company's current problem, you provide a compelling reason for them to hire you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

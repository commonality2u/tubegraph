The concept of "surviving a layoff" is challenged as a misconception, as everyone at a company is affected by such events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Companies often expect business to return to normal after layoffs, but the reality is that layoffs cause massive trauma, severing relationships and forever changing the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Impact of Layoffs on Remaining Employees

Employees who remain after layoffs often feel they have "dodged a bullet" and are happy to have a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, the workplace is permanently altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
*   **Loss of Colleagues** People you worked with closely are gone, often without a chance to say goodbye or gain closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Increased Workload** The work previously handled by laid-off employees often remains, leading to a doubling of workload for those who stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Employees may feel unable to complain due to the recent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Trust and Culture** The previous culture of trust, where employees felt their boss and company had their back, is shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Companies can no longer be seen as trustworthy or loyal employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## [[state_of_the_current_job_market | Current Job Market Realities]]

There is no longer job security in today's workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Widespread Layoffs** More companies are participating in multiple rounds of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This includes profitable companies, which may even be more likely to lay off employees in the current market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Questionable Practices** Companies are noted for behaving poorly in how they conduct layoffs, such as employees finding out their badge doesn't swipe, being locked out of equipment, or mass layoffs via Zoom or pre-recorded messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   **LinkedIn Example** A recent layoff at LinkedIn saw a list of 500-600 names leaked to employees before the layoffs, which were confirmed when everyone on the list was laid off on Monday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   **Zoom Layoff Example** One TikTok video showed a person being laid off over Zoom, along with 800 others, and not even receiving severance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Messaging** Companies often say that everything is going great and deny plans for layoffs, but then proceed with layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It's crucial to pay attention to a company's actions rather than just their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Re-hiring for Laid-off Roles** Companies frequently lay off full-time employees, only to re-post the same positions months later, often as contract roles with lower pay and no benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Historical Shift** The traditional model of long-term employment with one or two employers for an entire career, often culminating in a pension, has been shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Nowadays, employees are lucky to get a year at an organization, with some experiencing multiple layoffs within a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Accountability** Companies often make knee-jerk reactions at the first sign of market downturns, laying off staff, and then hiring back months later, with little apparent accountability for these decisions that drastically affect lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Mental Health Impact** The instability and arbitrary nature of modern layoffs can have significant mental health consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Navigating the [[challenges_in_the_job_market | Current Job Market]]

Given the lack of job security, employees must take proactive steps to protect themselves and [[evaluating_job_security_and_company_loyalty | evaluate company loyalty]]:
*   **No Such Thing as a "Survivor"** The idea of "surviving a layoff" is misleading; everyone is affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Recognize Red Flags** If your company is conducting massive layoffs, especially in questionable ways, consider it a huge red flag for your stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Do not assume you are "too special" or "too unique" to be on the next layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Act Proactively** Be pragmatic and take proactive steps to update your resume, network, and protect your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Start aggressively looking at your options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Act as the CEO of Your Career** Take ownership of your career and do not be caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
    *   **Due Diligence for New Opportunities** When interviewing for a new company, research their layoff history: how they handled them, how long ago they occurred, and if the position being interviewed for was affected in previous rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It's important to understand why a position might be replaced so soon after layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
    *   **Beware of Immediate Job Changes** Be cautious about leaving a steady job for a new opportunity, as some individuals find themselves laid off from the new role within a month, losing both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

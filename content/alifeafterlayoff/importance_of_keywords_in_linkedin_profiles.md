Having a strong [[linkedin_profile_strategy_and_headshot_importance | LinkedIn profile]] is crucial for career opportunities, and understanding how recruiters use keywords is key to maximizing your profile's visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## How Recruiters Use LinkedIn

As a corporate recruiter with extensive experience, LinkedIn is used extensively to source and find candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Recruiters utilize "LinkedIn Recruiter," a separate back-end site, to search the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Anything you put into your profile can be searched using keywords or filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This allows recruiters to perform "boolean searches" by combining search strings to find very specific combinations of skill sets, saving a lot of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This method helps recruiters find highly targeted candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, unlike open job postings which often yield many untargeted applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Why Keywords Matter

If your [[linkedin_profile_strategy_and_headshot_importance | LinkedIn profile]] does not include the specific keywords recruiters are searching for, you will not appear in their search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

> "Essentially what you should be doing is loading down your LinkedIn profile with all the keywords that I might be looking for as a recruiter." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>

The more keywords you add to your profile, the easier it will be for recruiters to find you, increasing the likelihood of being contacted about opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## How to Identify and Use Keywords

The type of keywords you should add depends on your industry and the positions available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

*   **Stay Informed:** Keep a pulse on your industry to identify major skills and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Include Relevant Skills:** If you possess the skills commonly sought after in your field, ensure they are prominently featured in your [[linkedin_profile_strategy_and_headshot_importance | LinkedIn profile]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

By strategically incorporating relevant keywords, you enhance your profile's [[importance_of_discoverability_and_networking_in_job_searching | discoverability]] and increase your chances of being noticed by recruiters for suitable job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

When considering new employment or evaluating a current role, it's crucial to [[recognizing_job_scams | recognize job scams]] and identify [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flags in job offers]] and [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | job postings]]. Pay close attention to what companies say during interviews or in the workplace, as certain phrases can signal a challenging or potentially bad employment situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While not every company using these phrases is problematic, they are common indicators to watch out for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

## Common Phrases Signalling False Promises

### "We Work Hard, We Play Hard"
This phrase typically implies an expectation of extremely long hours and a stressful work environment with often unattainable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. The culture might be fear-based, and the "play hard" aspect, such as elaborate vacations or bonuses, is often difficult to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>. These "celebrations" often occur after hours or on weekends without compensation, eating into personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>.

### "We Are Family"
Often heard in smaller, privately owned companies, but sometimes also in larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:06">[02:31:06]</a>. This statement can be manipulative, as employers may expect employees to treat the company as if it were their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:06">[03:03:06]</a>. This is unrealistic and can be insulting, sometimes leading to a "cult-like" environment where employees are expected to share the company's enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:06">[03:15:06]</a>.

### "We Will Promote You Later, We Promise"
This is a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>. If a promotion promise isn't in writing, it's likely a tactic to get you to accept a lower salary because the company may lack the budget or willingness to pay your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:06">[03:37:06]</a>. If you're consistently promised a promotion that never materializes or the "target always seems to move," it's a strong indicator to update your resume and seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:06">[04:00:06]</a>. Good companies value their employees and honor promises of advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:06">[04:10:06]</a>. This relates directly to [[dealing_with_unfulfilled_career_promises | dealing with unfulfilled career promises]].

### "You Are Replaceable"
This verbalization indicates a lack of value for employees, creating a fear-based work environment where employees may feel constantly under scrutiny and easily dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:06">[04:40:06]</a>. Working for such a company means giving away your power and living in fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:06">[04:52:06]</a>. If a company treats you this way, it's advisable to make yourself replaceable by finding a new job that values your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:06">[05:01:06]</a>.

### "We Wear a Lot of Hats Here"
Commonly heard in startup companies, this often means you'll be expected to perform multiple jobs outside your primary scope for a lower salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:06">[05:16:06]</a>. If a company claims to be in "startup mode" after five to seven years, it's a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:06">[05:38:06]</a>. They may continue to use this as an excuse for overworking employees and underpaying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:06">[05:45:06]</a>. This is an example of [[unreasonable_expectations_from_employers | unreasonable expectations from employers]].

### "We Only Hire Rock Stars"
This phrase, often found in [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | job advertisements]], suggests a desire for top talent but may not be backed by competitive compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:06">[05:57:06]</a>. If a company isn't willing to compensate for "the best of the best," it's a [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:06">[06:10:06]</a>.

### "We Are Always Hiring"
If an established company is perpetually hiring, it often indicates a high turnover rate or a "revolving door" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:06">[06:19:06]</a>. While rapidly growing companies might be an exception, for established businesses, it's a major [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:06">[06:30:06]</a>. In such cases, it's crucial to ask pointed questions during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:06">[06:44:06]</a>. [[Employer_motivations_behind_fake_postings | Employer motivations behind fake postings]] can also contribute to this phenomenon.

### Promises of Recall After Layoff
Some companies lay off employees at the first sign of trouble, promising to call them back when conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:06">[06:56:06]</a>. These are often the same companies that claim to be a "family environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>. If a company has laid you off, it shows a lack of commitment, and you should consider seeking employment elsewhere rather than returning to a potentially unstable situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:06">[07:33:06]</a>.

### The Foosball Table (A Joke, But Not Really)
Beware of companies that highlight perks like a foosball table to mask a poor work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:06">[07:43:06]</a>. Such amenities are like "lipstick on a pig" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:06">[08:02:06]</a>. If a company treats employees poorly, has a toxic culture, or pays low wages, a foosball table doesn't negate the fact that it's a low-quality employer to be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:06">[08:05:06]</a>.

Ultimately, being aware of these phrases can help you identify [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flags]] and make informed decisions about where to apply or whether to make an exit strategy from a current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

When companies decide which employees will be included in a [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]] list, seniority often plays a significant role. However, the impact of seniority can cut both ways, affecting both newer and more established employees depending on other [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | factors influencing employee layoffs]].

## Seniority: Last In, First Out
One of the most common approaches companies take during a [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]] is to target newer employees based on their tenure. This is often referred to as a "last in, first out" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Companies frequently lay off employees who have more recently joined the team or organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Newer tenured employees are frequently targeted as the first to be let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

This approach introduces a considerable risk for individuals who leave a long-standing position to take a new job, as they might become the "low person on the totem pole" in their new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Seniority vs. Performance
While seniority can protect some employees, it is not always enough to guarantee job security.
*   If an employee's [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] is lower than that of their colleagues, seniority alone will not keep them off the [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]] list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. New employees moving to a different company are advised to outperform peers in their new department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Seniority and Cost-Cutting Measures
Paradoxically, high seniority can also make employees vulnerable during [[factors_influencing_employee_layoffs | cost-cutting measures]].
*   Companies scrutinize overall payroll, which is one of their largest expenses, especially during economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Employees who are senior in their careers and have accumulated high salaries may be targeted if their skills have "atrophied" or haven't kept pace with market demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   It can become an "easy decision" to select these individuals for [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]], as they can potentially be replaced by someone cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This is particularly relevant with the rise of disruptive technologies like AI, which can potentially eliminate positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

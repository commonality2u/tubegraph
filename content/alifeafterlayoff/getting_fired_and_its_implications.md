The question often arises whether it is better to quit, get fired, or get laid off from a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article breaks down the pros and cons of getting fired, particularly as it relates to job interviews and your status as an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## What is Getting Fired?

Getting fired means the employer decides to end your employment arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Generally, there are not many positives associated with being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Potential Advantages of Being Fired

The main, and possibly only, reason someone might prefer to be fired over quitting is the potential to collect unemployment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

*   **Unemployment Eligibility**: Eligibility for unemployment benefits after being fired is not automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   If terminated for gross negligence, such as causing a fight or stealing, unemployment claims would likely be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   However, if you are fired due to poor performance (e.g., not being good at your job, written warnings, or being on a [[steps_to_take_if_facing_potential_termination | performance Improvement plan]]), employers will have difficulty defending an unemployment claim, and you are likely to receive benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. In such cases, being fired for performance-related issues may not be the worst outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Disadvantages and Implications of Being Fired

There are numerous negatives associated with being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

*   **Stigma and Personal Impact**:
    *   There is a significant stigma attached to being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   It can lead to uncomfortable conversations, such as telling family members about the termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Challenges in Job Interviews**:
    *   You will have to explain poor performance or other difficult issues in job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   Being terminated for cause is the hardest situation to overcome in an interview setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. It raises red flags with employers, leading them to question things more deeply and scrutinize your resume to assess the risk you pose to their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Loss of Control**:
    *   Getting fired is not on your own terms; you are at the mercy of the employer, who may or may not provide warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   While a [[steps_to_take_if_facing_potential_termination | Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)]] can give some individuals time to start a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, gross negligence can result in immediate termination, thrusting you unexpectedly into the unemployment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Rehire and References**:
    *   You are unlikely to be eligible for rehire by your former employer after being terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   It will likely be difficult to obtain positive references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. While employers generally do not disclose termination status during employment verification, they may check references, so having those arranged is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Specific Scenarios

*   **Poor Performance**: If you have a track record of poor performance and notice HR documenting you or placing you on a [[steps_to_take_if_facing_potential_termination | Performance Improvement Plan]], it might actually be better to get terminated if the issues are strictly performance-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is because you would be able to collect unemployment and potentially have a continuation of benefits, without losing the ability to get a positive reference or rehire eligibility (which might already be compromised) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

The concept of a traditional career, where an individual selects a career at age 18, works for 40 years, remains a dedicated employee, and then collects a pension before retiring, is considered "completely dead" in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This model, which emphasized loyalty from both employee and employer, no longer exists for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Traditional Career (Past)

### Job Security and Loyalty
In past generations, like those of parents and grandparents, individuals would enter the workforce at age 18 and often land their first job with relative ease, sometimes through nepotism or by simply submitting a basic resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They could expect to work a fulfilling 45-year career with a great pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Employers treated employees with a high degree of loyalty and vice versa, making mass layoffs uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Even if an employee was not proficient in one role, they might be moved to a different department rather than being let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This environment allowed people to work 40+ years relatively uninterrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Hiring Process
Hiring was once a highly localized process, with companies based in specific geographic regions primarily employing people from those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This local focus fostered connections and often led to familial hiring practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Retirement Benefits
Historically, employers commonly provided defined benefit plans, such as pensions, which covered the entirety of an employee's retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Reasons for Decline (Present)

### Short-Term Mentality and "What Have You Done For Me Lately" Culture
The modern workplace operates with an "instant gratification" mentality, where immediate results are prioritized, and focus is on the next news cycle or earnings report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This has led to a "what have you done for me lately" environment, where past achievements offer little security for future employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This mindset is believed to be linked to an overly connected world with instant data and rapid changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Increased Competition Due to Globalization and Online Job Boards
The rise of a global economy, coupled with the prevalence of online job boards like LinkedIn, has drastically changed the hiring landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Job seekers now apply for thousands of jobs globally from their homes, intensifying competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Today, individuals compete with thousands of others worldwide for a single position, making it much harder to secure employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Cycle of Layoffs and Economic Instability
Companies increasingly adopt a short-term mentality, leading to a cycle of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This cycle often mirrors economic patterns: expansion and bloating followed by a major event that triggers mass layoffs, leading to a "right-sizing" of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. While historically observed over approximately 10-year periods, this cycle appears to be shortening and accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Historical examples of this cycle include:
*   **Late 1990s - Early 2000s**: The dot-com bubble led to company growth, followed by its burst and the 9/11 event, resulting in widespread panic and layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Mid-2000s - 2008**: Economic pickup and re-bloating of companies led to the 2008 subprime real estate bubble burst, causing mass layoffs and market uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **2010 - 2020**: A decade of uninterrupted growth caused companies to "bloat" significantly, culminating in the 2020 pandemic which shut down the economy and triggered continuous "right-sizing" through layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This pattern suggests that the traditional, stable employment market is unlikely to return to its previous form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution Plans
A major shift in the employment arrangement occurred between the 1970s and 1990s, moving from defined benefit plans (pensions) to defined contribution plans (like 401ks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This transition shifted the burden of retirement funding almost entirely onto the employee, with employers typically offering only a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Adding to this, companies often implement long vesting periods, typically four or more years, for employees to claim employer-matched contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If an employee is laid off before vesting, the employer reclaims the unvested funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This further demonstrates employers' reduced commitment to employees and contributes to the decline of loyalty in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Rise of Disruptive Technologies
The emergence of disruptive technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), is significantly impacting the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. AI is considered the most disruptive technology to enter the workforce conversation in generations, with the potential to displace millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This technological advancement further allows employers to detach from employee loyalty, as they may no longer need human employees in the same capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Implications and Future of Work

The traditional career model is dead and unlikely to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. As a result, the approach to work is rapidly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Key trends for the future of work include:
*   **Increased Short-Term Assignments and Job Hopping**: Short-term assignments will become more common, and [[impact_of_job_hopping_on_career_progression | job hopping]] will likely become less taboo, especially given the frequency of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Rise of Contract Positions**: Employers will increasingly favor contract positions to avoid the costs associated with full-time employees and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Personal Responsibility for Retirement Funding**: Employees can no longer rely on employers to fund their retirement, necessitating a re-evaluation of personal retirement strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This is especially critical for those approaching retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Strategic [[career_management_and_development | Career Management]]**: Individuals must approach their careers more strategically, acting as "free agents" and "CEOs" of their own [[career_management_and_development | career management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This proactive approach is essential because employers can no longer be relied upon to prioritize employees' best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The transformations in the modern job market are irreversible, requiring individuals to adapt and reclaim control over their professional lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

*   Damaging your professional [[employment_brand | employment brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   Former "work friends" perceiving you as a risk or "loose cannon," which could prevent them from referring you to future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Experiencing only short-term satisfaction from a dramatic exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   Potentially facing legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Strategies for a Graceful Exit

### Maintain Discretion
Avoid telling anyone about your plans to leave until you are fully prepared to move on and have another opportunity secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If you inform your boss too soon, you might find yourself out of a job sooner than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It's generally easier to find a job when you are currently employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Keep your job search and decision to leave discreet, even from close work friends, as rumors can get out and complicate your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Inform Your Boss First
Once you have a confirmed start date for your new role and all pre-employment checks are complete, schedule a face-to-face or Zoom meeting with your boss to give your notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Do not send an email or text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. It is vital that your boss is the first to know, not through the "grapevine" from colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Deliver Notice Professionally
When [[discussing_reasons_for_leaving_current_job | discussing reasons for leaving your current job]], keep the conversation brief and to the point. Focus on having a new opportunity that is a better move for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Avoid elaborating on negative aspects of the job or boss, as this can escalate emotions and create an unnecessary "powder keg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Your decision should already be made, and you should not entertain [[understanding_and_negotiating_severance_packages | counter offers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Be courteous, thank your boss for the opportunity and time, and give your two weeks' notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Coordinate Communication
After informing your boss, ask for their guidance on when it's appropriate to inform coworkers, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Following proper protocol leaves a good impression and shows you handled the situation professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Consider Your Colleagues
Understand that your departure will create a void of work, increasing the workload for your coworkers and potentially affecting clients or internal customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Be graceful and considerate of those who will pick up your responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Give Two Weeks' Notice
It is highly recommended to give two weeks' notice as a professional courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This allows you to tie up loose ends and enables the company and your colleagues to manage the transition of your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. While not legally required, it prevents "screwing over" the people you've worked with by leaving them scrambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Connect and Thank Key People
On your last day, if possible, call a quick huddle or personally contact those who were instrumental in your career, such as mentors or trainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Give them a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This is also an opportune time to ask them to join your personal network, particularly on LinkedIn, as building these connections is crucial for future [[preparing_for_job_interviews_after_leaving_a_job | career opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Maintain Positivity
When explaining your departure, maintain a positive tone. Focus on a better opportunity for your family rather than criticizing the company, job, or boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Express appreciation for working with the team, the growth opportunities, and thank everyone sincerely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Avoid trashing people as you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Keep the Door Open
Leaving on good terms keeps the door "cracked open" for potential future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Things might not work out at your new job, and you may wish to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Maintaining a good relationship with your ex-bosses is also important for future references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. If your former boss moves to another company, they might even call you for opportunities there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

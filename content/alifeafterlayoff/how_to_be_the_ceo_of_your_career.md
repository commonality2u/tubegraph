Becoming the CEO of your career means taking [[strategies_for_job_security_and_career_ownership | ownership]] of your professional journey and proactively managing it like a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This involves looking at your career analytically and making intentional choices to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## A Cautionary Tale: The Price of Apathy
The speaker recounts a personal experience that shaped his philosophy on [[career management and development | career management and development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Early in his career, he joined a railroad services company with approximately 600-700 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. His role, Staffing and Development Manager (effectively an HR Manager), provided "meaty" and valuable experience, allowing him to impact the business by hiring and developing managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

The premise for accepting this role was a promise of promotion: he was to learn from the Vice President of Human Resources, who was supposed to retire in 18 months, after which the speaker would take over the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

### The Stalled Promotion
The VP was particular in his approach but had a high degree of empathy for employees, fostering a "family-oriented" atmosphere within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The work environment was laid back, offering a high degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

However, the promised retirement never materialized within the 18-month timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The VP, along with other senior leaders nearing retirement, held onto their positions, enjoying their "kingdoms" and significant bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Peers Take Control of Their Careers
While the speaker was part of a leadership development group being groomed for advancement, his peers started leaving the organization when promotions didn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Many of these leaders, including his boss, would tell their direct reports they weren't ready, while secretly believing nobody was capable of taking over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

Of the 8-10 people in the succession group, only one or two achieved their expected level within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Those who left demonstrated [[proactive_career_management_strategies | proactive career management strategies]], seeking opportunities where their readiness would be recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### The Consequences of Waiting
The speaker, despite seeing his peers leave, became comfortable and apathetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. He stayed for nine years, seven of which were spent waiting for the promised HR leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. He stopped caring about going above and beyond or being considered for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This comfort led him to stop making decisions in his long-term career interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

He fell behind in industry knowledge, technology, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. When he eventually left, he realized he had to take a step down in responsibility to gain the necessary experience at larger companies, setting his career back by about a decade compared to his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

## Principles of Being the CEO of Your Career

The speaker's experience highlights several critical lessons for effective [[strategies_for_effective_career_management | career management and development]]:

*   **Play Chess, Not Checkers**
    *   Don't just react to immediate opportunities; have a strategic plan and vision for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
    *   Consistently assess where you are and where you want to go, planning your moves multiple steps ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid Apathy and Comfort**
    *   A steady paycheck can lead to complacency, causing you to neglect your long-term career interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
    *   Don't let your passion dwindle. Stay engaged and push for growth, rather than just doing the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

*   **Continuous Learning and Growth**
    *   Stay current with industry trends, new technologies, and relevant skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Neglecting this will put you behind your peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.
    *   Actively seek development opportunities, rather than waiting for them to be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

*   **Don't Wait for Recognition**
    *   Don't wait for your current company or boss to recognize your efforts or readiness for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.
    *   If you know you're ready for the next level, and your current organization isn't providing the path, seek opportunities elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

*   **Act as a [[acting_as_a_free_agent_in_your_career | Free Agent]]**
    *   Regularly test the open market to understand your value and compensation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
    *   Always be open to new opportunities, even if you're not actively looking. A true CEO of their career remains available for the best opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

*   **Be Aware of Your Career Runway**
    *   Time passes quickly, especially in mid-career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. Grandiose plans can quickly run out of time if you're apathetic and waiting for things to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

### Practical Steps for Your Career
To [[career advancement through selfinterest | advance your career through self-interest]] and take control, consider these actions:
*   **Sign up for newsletters** that offer actionable tips on [[career strategy and coaching | career strategy and coaching]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Build a strong resume** that highlights your value to recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.
*   **Market yourself effectively** in interviews, especially when seeking a promotion or a higher-level role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. Hiring managers often prefer lateral moves, so you must convince them of your high potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage your network**, particularly platforms like LinkedIn, to attract recruiters and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. Getting contacted by recruiters is often easier than constantly applying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
*   **Master offer negotiation** to ensure you're not leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

By proactively managing your career, learning new skills, and seeking out opportunities, you can avoid stagnation and achieve your professional goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. This is particularly relevant for those who are stuck, unsatisfied, or frustrated in their current positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

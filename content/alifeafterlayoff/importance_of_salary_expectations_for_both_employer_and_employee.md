The question "What's your [[discussing_salary_expectations | salary expectation]]?" is frequently asked by recruiters and can be a significant hurdle in the job interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Answering incorrectly or not at all can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Understanding the [[role_of_salary_expectations_in_job_offers | role of salary expectations]] is crucial for both candidates and employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Employer's Perspective

Recruiters typically ask about salary expectations towards the end of an interview, especially for candidates they are interested in moving to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This is done to assess if the candidate's expectations fit within the established [[dealing_with_salary_ranges_and_expectations | salary band]] for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This information is then included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

It's generally not a trick question; recruiters genuinely want to know a candidate's [[discussing_salary_expectations | salary expectation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The goal is to ensure that if an offer is extended, the candidate will not only accept but also be excited and feel they received a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This prevents dissatisfaction that could lead to the employee seeking other opportunities shortly after being hired, thus avoiding the need for the employer to refill the position within six months to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### When Expectations Differ from the Salary Band

*   **Candidate's Salary is Higher**: If a candidate's [[discussing_salary_expectations | salary expectation]] is too high for the role, they might be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Small discrepancies (e.g., $10,000 apart) might allow for some negotiation or hypothetical offers to gauge flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. However, significant gaps (e.g., $25,000 apart) usually mean an offer won't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. For highly talented "superstar" candidates, recruiters might still present their resume with accurate [[discussing_salary_expectations | salary expectations]] to the hiring manager, suggesting the role could be "enriched" or elevated to a higher level to accommodate the higher [[dealing_with_salary_ranges_and_expectations | salary range]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This is the exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Candidate's Salary is Lower**: Employers appreciate when a candidate's stated expectation is lower than the company's [[dealing_with_salary_ranges_and_expectations | salary band]] for the role, as it allows them to offer a significant raise, exciting the candidate and providing perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Major corporations have internal [[dealing_with_salary_ranges_and_expectations | salary bands]] (minimum, midpoint, max) based on [[the_importance_of_marketawareness_in_salary_negotiation | local market wage surveys]] and internal equity, ensuring similar roles are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. If a candidate's expectation is below the lowest point of the company's [[dealing_with_salary_ranges_and_expectations | range]], their offer will automatically be adjusted up to that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This often happens with candidates from smaller or less reputable companies, or those stepping into a higher-level role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Candidate Refuses to Answer**: Recruiters are unlikely to move a candidate forward if they refuse to provide a [[discussing_salary_expectations | salary expectation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Ambiguity suggests the candidate might be hiding something, and employers need to know they can "get a deal done" before investing further time in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Trying a "bait and switch" tactic by being ambiguous early and negotiating aggressively later typically doesn't work well and can annoy hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Recruiters may place candidates in the "no" pile if they sense too much frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Employee's Perspective

A candidate risks rejection if they answer the [[handling_questions_about_salary_expectations | salary expectation question]] incorrectly or avoid it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Accepting a salary below one's expectation leads to dissatisfaction and a tendency to look for other jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Having [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | realistic salary expectations]] is key; if these scare an employer away, it indicates they might not be a high-quality employer worth working for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Essential Knowledge for Candidates

To effectively answer the question, candidates need to know three key things:

1.  **Average Market Salary Range**: Research the typical [[dealing_with_salary_ranges_and_expectations | salary range]] for the specific role in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This involves using resources like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com, and comparing jobs in the local geographic area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This highlights [[the_importance_of_marketawareness_in_salary_negotiation | market awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
2.  **Company's Expected Pay**: Understand what the specific company is likely expecting to pay for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
3.  **Personal Bottom Line**: Identify the absolute minimum salary one can accept without compromising their financial needs or job satisfaction. This is crucial for [[importance_of_knowing_baseline_and_acceptable_salary_range | knowing when to walk away]] from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This number isn't necessarily shared with the recruiter but is for personal guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### How to Answer

There are several ways to answer the question about [[how_to_answer_salary_expectations_in_an_interview | salary expectations]]:

*   **Simply State Your Expectation**: If confident in your worth and alignment with the company's ballpark, directly state your number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Ensure it's reasonable and something you can live with throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Frame with Market Research**: If concerned about a lowball offer or being significantly above their expectation, frame your answer with market context: "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between [X] to [Y]. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This puts the onus back on the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Put the Question Back on the Recruiter**: If open to a potentially lower salary or unsure, ask the recruiter: "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have [[dealing_with_salary_ranges_and_expectations | salary bands]] that they need to keep within and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Be prepared with an answer if they push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Ultimately, open and honest communication about [[handling_salary_expectations_and_negotiations_appropriately | salary expectations]] benefits both parties by ensuring a mutually satisfying compensation agreement and a more stable employment relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

An extreme example of a low-quality job application was shared on LinkedIn by a talent acquisition manager, highlighting numerous red flags that job seekers should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This particular application was for a US-based remote role from an international company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Even if an international company is recruiting candidates from the United States, they are still required to adhere to US laws and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## [[Recognizing red flags in job postings]]

Several general [[Recognizing red flags in job postings | red flags]] can indicate a [[low_quality_employers | low-quality employer]] or a potential scam:

*   **HR Handling Recruitment for Large Corporations**
    *   If a large corporation does not have a dedicated Talent Acquisition department and recruitment is handled directly by Human Resources, this can be a [[Recognizing red flags in job postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While common in localized settings like factories, it's unusual for larger companies and might suggest a [[Scam job postings warning signs | scammy role]] or a [[Signs of low quality employers | low-quality employer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Lack of Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**
    *   Sending a manual form to fill out rather than using an ATS system or an online application is another [[Recognizing red flags in job postings | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Suspicious Financial Requests**
    *   Be very aware if an employer asks you to cash any checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. These are clear [[Scam job postings warning signs | scam warning signs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

If you encounter these situations, it's crucial to vet the opportunity thoroughly, verify that real people work there, and cross-reference information with the company's corporate website to avoid getting scammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Identifying Illegal or Invasive Questions

The application form discussed contained numerous illegal and highly invasive questions that are prohibited in the United States, indicating a potentially unprofessional or scamming entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Job seekers should keep their radar up for these types of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Questions to watch out for include:

*   **Marital Status**
    *   Asking about civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, or having a significant other) is illegal in the United States and has no bearing on one's ability to do the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Family Status**
    *   Questions about having children, the number of minors, or childcare arrangements during working hours are highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate based on family status or perceived childcare issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Instead, they should ask if you can meet specific schedule or hour requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Nationality and Country of Origin**
    *   Inquiring about passports held, nationality, country of birth, or country of origin is an illegal question in the United States, as it discloses national origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The proper question is whether you are legally able to work in the country without sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Age**
    *   Directly asking for your age is illegal in the United States due to age discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Religion**
    *   Asking about religion, or if religion has changed, is illegal as religion is a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate based on religious beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Height and Weight**
    *   While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight requirements tend to disproportionately limit opportunities for some protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Unless directly related to a job requirement, such inquiries should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Some states and local municipalities have specific laws prohibiting discrimination based on height and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions**
    *   Questions about medical conditions, medications, or upcoming surgeries are highly invasive and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

If you encounter any combination or variation of these questions during a job application or interview, it should be considered a [[Signs of low quality employers | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Avoiding such employers is crucial to ensure you are pursuing opportunities with [[Signs of a great employer | high-quality employers]] and avoiding potential scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

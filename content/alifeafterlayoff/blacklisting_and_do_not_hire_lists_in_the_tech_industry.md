Job seekers may encounter situations where, despite their qualifications, they are unable to secure an interview or employment with a company, particularly a former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon is known as blacklisting or being placed on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Companies like Meta have confirmed they maintain such lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Meta's Blacklisting Practices

A Business Insider expos√© revealed that former Meta employees were blocked from rehire, placed on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. One senior engineer, affected by Meta's 2022 layoffs (which were initially stated as non-performance-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, found themselves unable to get rehired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This engineer had previously received strong performance ratings, including "exceeding expectations," and a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Their contributions were even deemed "critical to the company's success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

After applying for nearly 20 positions within a year of being laid off, the engineer noticed a pattern: hiring managers expressed interest and set up screening calls, but the company's internal recruiters would then "ghost" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The engineer's hiring manager eventually discovered that the recruiting team had forbidden contact because the engineer was "ineligible for rehire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Meta reportedly uses multiple internal systems, including a "non-regrettable attrition" designation and a "do not hire" flag, to track rehire ineligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This information is typically stored in HRIS systems rather than applicant tracking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Reasons for Being Blacklisted

While Meta's official stance claims "clear criteria" for being marked ineligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, including:
*   Reason for separation (e.g., "rage quitting" without notice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
*   Policy violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   Performance termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
*   Involuntary resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
*   Last performance ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>
*   The status of "non-regrettable attrition," indicating the company was happy about the employee's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

However, former managers suggest that managers often had "broad discretion" to add names to these lists without documented performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This means simply "pissing off your employer" or manager could lead to blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Moreover, Meta later shifted its policy, stating that all future layoffs would be performance-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This change effectively "scarlet-lettered" previous layoff victims as poor performers, potentially leading to [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager biases in recruitment]] in the broader tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### How Individuals Discover They Are Blacklisted

It is typically impossible for individuals to directly inquire if they are on such a list, as companies will not disclose this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. However, some former Meta employees learned about their blacklisting through:
*   **Internal Recruiters:** Initial communication with internal recruiters is smooth, but then contact slows or stops, leading to a "random rejection letter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Headhunting Agencies:** An external recruiter, excited about a candidate's fit, submits their candidacy, only to be informed by the company that the candidate is on a "do not hire" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Other Forms of Blacklisting

While formal "do not hire" lists are more common for former employees, other forms of informal blacklisting can occur:

### Excessive Applications
Applying for numerous different jobs at the same company, especially if they are unrelated, can be perceived as "spammy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Staffing and hiring teams may develop a bias against candidates with extensive application histories, particularly if they have been rejected by multiple teams or failed previous interview processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

*   **Amazon Example:** Amazon reportedly tracks past interview performance. Candidates who failed technical screens might have a "recycle period" (e.g., 6 months) to reapply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. However, failure based on "leadership principles" (behavioral interviews) could result in a permanent ban, effectively blacklisting the candidate from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### Backdoor References
A "backdoor reference" occurs when someone on a hiring team covertly contacts an individual who previously worked with a candidate at a former company to solicit an unofficial opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. These references, which happen "behind the scenes," can significantly harm a candidate's chances and lead to blacklisting, particularly in smaller industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This is a form of [[predatory_hiring_practices | predatory hiring practices]] due to its unofficial and potentially biased nature.

## Navigating the Job Market

While blacklisting exists, it is not believed to be a widespread practice across all industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. For job seekers, it's advised to focus on building a career with high conviction and authority, reclaiming control over their professional path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

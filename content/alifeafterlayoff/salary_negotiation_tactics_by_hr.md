Human Resources (HR) departments, including talent acquisition, often employ tactics to control salary expectations and offers during the hiring and employment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. While they can sometimes be an ally, especially at lower organizational levels, their primary function is to limit company liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, which often influences their approach to compensation.

## Undermining Your Worth

HR departments will frequently try to pay you less than you deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Their aim is to acquire talent at the lowest possible cost, particularly if candidates are unfamiliar with [[salary_negotiations_and_expectations | salary negotiation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Hiding Behind "Process and Policy"

A common tactic is for HR to hide behind established "process and policy" to justify lower offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Rigid Salary Bands

HR will attempt to fit candidates into very narrow and often rigid "salary bands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. They may cite "internal equity" as a reason they cannot offer a higher amount, even when a candidate's experience or market value might warrant it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Promotions in Name Only

This rigidity can extend to current employees, where HR might use the excuse that an employee is already at the "top end of our salary bands" to deny a significant raise with a promotion, resulting in a "promotion in name only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Deceptive Promises

HR frequently makes a lower-than-expected offer with the promise that things will be "revisited in a few months" or that a "salary revision" will occur after a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

> [00:06:11] **Beware**: Such promises rarely materialize unless explicitly included and documented in your official offer letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Relying on verbal assurances from HR is often futile, as it's difficult to prove without written documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Selective Flexibility

Despite claims of rigid policies, HR departments often demonstrate surprising flexibility when dealing with "rockstar candidates" who demand higher salaries or with critical employees who tender their resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This suggests that the rigidity of salary bands can be overcome when the company perceives a high value or risk in losing talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

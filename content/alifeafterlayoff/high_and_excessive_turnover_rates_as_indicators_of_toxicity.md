Recognizing a [[toxic_work_environment | toxic work environment]] often begins with subtle signs that become increasingly difficult to ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Being in such an environment can be physically and emotionally draining, impacting not only the individual but also those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. It can lead to anxiety, sleep issues, dread of work, and even physical health problems through manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Furthermore, a [[toxic_workplace_dynamics | toxic work environment]] can set back a career by years, making individuals feel like failures despite previous effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

As an HR professional and corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, common [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | signs of a toxic workplace]] often involve [[turnover_rates_and_job_stability | turnover rates and job stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## High Voluntary Turnover

High [[turnover_rates_and_job_stability | turnover rates]] are a definitive indicator that something is wrong within a workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. While some turnover is natural and even healthy for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, an abnormally high rate, whether company-wide or within a specific department, strongly signals trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

This specific red flag refers to *voluntary* turnover, where employees choose to leave, not instances of termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Generally, people do not leave positive and supportive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. In healthy organizations, if an employee faces a roadblock in career progression, the company might offer opportunities in other departments or develop strategies for continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

In fact, the best companies typically maintain a much lower turnover rate than the average 22% across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. If you notice a "revolving door" shortly after joining an organization, it warrants immediate attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This is why it's crucial to ask questions during the interview process, such as "Why is this position open?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

To understand why people are leaving, it's important to:
*   Check recent reviews on platforms like Glassdoor to identify common patterns or complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   Listen to discussions and glean information from other departments about turnover reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Excessive Involuntary Turnover

Another significant [[understanding_company_turnover_as_a_red_flag | red flag]] is excessive involuntary turnover, which occurs when a company terminates, fires, or lays off employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. A new organization with a reputation for terminating staff for minor infractions or for not meeting extremely challenging metrics is a major cause for concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

These types of companies often react impulsively to market conditions, believing they can easily rehire those same employees when conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Such behavior indicates either an inept management team or, at worst, one that disregards its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This is not the type of organization you want to be associated with; instead, seek companies that genuinely value their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

The same applies to bosses who arbitrarily fire employees, possibly for not meeting unreasonable standards or expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This creates an unstable and definitively [[recognizing_a_toxic_work_culture | toxic work environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. If you find yourself in a [[dealing_with_high_turnover_and_job_insecurity | dealing with high turnover and job insecurity]] situation, it's crucial to assess if the issue is systematic across the company or localized to a specific individual or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. If it's a company-wide problem that cannot be easily resolved, consider what is best for your career, as prioritizing your own well-being as a "free agent" is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

Everyone is bound to make [[Common interview mistakes|career mistakes]] at some point in their professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article, based on insights from a corporate recruiter and career coach, highlights six common career [[Common interview mistakes|mistakes]] that people often learn the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The speaker himself has made several of these [[Common interview mistakes|mistakes]] and shares these lessons to help others avoid similar pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## 1. Not Realizing a Critical Mistake Until Later
One of the biggest lessons often learned late in a career is the realization of a critical mistake made earlier, when it might be too late to easily rectify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

This can manifest as:
*   Staying in a job for too long or overstaying your welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Not responding to a recruiter for an amazing job opportunity due to fear or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Accepting a job offer that wasn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Moving to a part of the country that wasn't ideal, or conversely, not moving for a significant career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Focusing too long on a specific job type or career vertical, only to realize it wasn't resonating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

With hindsight, it's easy to wish you could advise your younger self to make a career change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Career coaches often pinpoint these moments when individuals feel stuck or unhappy with their progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

> [!TIP] Anticipate that your future self might have an epiphany and wish you had made a change today, especially if you're contemplating a career change and unsure about the timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## 2. Loyalty Rarely Pays Off
Blind loyalty to a company or leader often leads to missed opportunities and stalled career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The speaker shares an experience where he stayed in a role for five years, expecting a promotion that never materialized, while his peers moved into leadership positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This loyalty led to him being left behind in terms of responsibility, level, and compensation in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Staying too long in one company or role can lead to the market moving beyond you, leaving you behind your peer group in terms of advancement and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## 3. Hard Work Does Not Necessarily Lead to Promotions
While effort is important, simply putting in long hours does not guarantee promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The speaker recounts working 12+ hour days, sometimes weekends, to impress a workaholic boss, only for the company's plan to shut down, leading to a job search without a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

> [!TIP] Stop working so many long hours. It's not the person who works the most hours that gets promoted, but the person who works the smartest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Working smart means focusing on projects that your boss and your boss's boss care about, not just tasks you think are impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## 4. Failing to Advocate for Yourself
Promotions are earned through highly visible projects and, crucially, by letting the right people know about your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Many people make the mistake of not advocating for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] You must be your own advocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Your direct boss often doesn't make the final promotion decisions; it's usually their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. You need to find ways to be visible to your boss's boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Think of yourself as the CEO of your career, which includes being your own marketing department. You need to create campaigns to market your effectiveness within your company, department, and job, as well as on the open market during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. If you want to move up, you must stop being stubborn about self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## 5. Over-specializing in Irrelevant Skills
Being excellent at a specific skill can be an advantage, but relevant skills are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Employers value certain skills until they no longer need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. If your employer's needs change or you move to a new company or industry, your specialized skills might become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

> [!WARNING] You can end up with a [[Common mistakes in resume writing|resume]] full of skills nobody cares about anymore, leading to panic and settling for lower-quality jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

> [!TIP] Focus on developing highly relevant skills that are in demand by *multiple* employers, not just your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## 6. Being Valued Only for Your Latest Contributions
A painful lesson, especially relevant during periods of layoffs, is that "you're only as good as what you've done last" or "what have you done for me lately?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. While past achievements and built-up goodwill might buy you a couple of months, if employers don't see you contributing, or don't have future plans for your skills, you could find yourself on an unwanted list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Goodwill built up is typically short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Senior leaders are primarily concerned with what you can produce tomorrow, not just what you produced yesterday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Taking Ownership of Your Career

To navigate these challenges, you must act like a free agent and prioritize yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. It's not selfish to put yourself first in your career and your employer second, as long as you do it smartly and develop the necessary skills and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This is what it means to be the CEO of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Everyone is likely to make a career mistake at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even with advice, people often learn these lessons the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article outlines six common career mistakes, often observed in coaching calls, that individuals typically learn through difficult personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The insights shared are often drawn from the speaker's own past or the experiences of people they know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## 1. Not Realizing Critical Mistakes Until It's Too Late

A significant lesson often learned late in one's career is that a critical mistake was made early on, but its impact wasn't recognized until years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Examples of Early Mistakes
*   **Staying in a job for too long** or overstaying one's welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Not responding to a recruiter** for an amazing job opportunity due to fear or being too comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Accepting a job offer** that wasn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Making a poor relocation decision**, such as moving to an unsuitable area or not moving to a place that could have opened a new career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Focusing too long on a specific job type or career vertical** only to realize later it wasn't fulfilling, making a change much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### The Benefit of Hindsight
It's easy to look back with hindsight and wish one could advise their younger self to change careers when it was less difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. These things often aren't obvious at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. In career coaching, an expert can often pinpoint where an individual's career veered off track when they express unhappiness or feeling stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This is particularly relevant if you are considering a career change and are unsure of the timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## 2. Loyalty Rarely Pays Off

A tough lesson is that loyalty to a company or leader rarely leads to career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. One personal example involved staying in a role too long, waiting for a senior leader to retire as promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This wait extended from 18 months to over 5 years, with the leader showing no intention of leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Consequences of Excessive Loyalty
*   **Stagnation**: Staying loyal meant being stuck in a role while the rest of the market and peers progressed into leadership positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Lost Compensation**: This led to being significantly behind the market in terms of compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Career Derailment**: Excessive loyalty can cause a career to go off track, letting leadership opportunities pass by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## 3. Hard Work Does Not Automatically Lead to Promotions

A common misconception is that simply putting in long hours and doing hard work guarantees promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The speaker's experience showed that excessive effort often resulted in a "dangling carrot" that was continuously moved further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Pressuring oneself to work long hours, especially under a workaholic boss, does not ensure recognition or promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In one instance, working 12+ hour days and weekends didn't lead to promotion, and the plan ended up shutting down within a year and a half, necessitating a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:05:02]</a>.

### What Leads to Promotions?
*   **Working Smart**: Promotions are earned by those who work the smartest, not necessarily the hardest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Strategic Project Focus**: This means working on projects that your boss and your boss's boss care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. If you're working on tasks they don't value, your efforts may go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Visibility and Self-Advocacy**: Getting promoted requires working on highly visible projects and, crucially, letting the right people know about your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   The "right person" is often not your direct boss, but your boss's boss, who makes promotion decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   You must be your own advocate; no one else in the organization will advocate for your promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Act Like the CEO of Your Career**: This involves wearing multiple hats, including being your own marketing department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. You need to create campaigns to market your effectiveness within the company, department, and job, as well as on the open market during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## 4. Not Prioritizing Relevant Skills

While being exceptionally good at a specific task can be an advantage, [[strategies_for_protecting_your_career | relevant skills]] matter more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Employers value certain skills until they no longer need them, which can make you irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Similarly, a skill valued at one company might not be valued by others in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### The Danger of Irrelevant Skills
*   You can end up with a resume full of skills that no one cares about anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   This can lead to feeling stuck, panicking, and settling for jobs below your potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   One low-quality job can lead to another, causing serious [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid | resume issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Solution
Focus on developing relevant skills that are highly in demand by multiple employers, not just your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## 5. Being Only as Good as What You've Done Last (Short-Lived Goodwill)

A particularly painful lesson, especially relevant during periods of layoffs, is that "you're only as good as what you've done last," or "what have you done for me lately?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Even if you excelled on a major project last year and built up goodwill, this goodwill is typically very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### The Reality of Employer Expectations
*   If employers don't feel you're currently contributing, or if they don't see how your skills will contribute in the future, you may find yourself on a layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   The concept of loyalty often clashes with this reality; people are baffled when laid off despite years of great work and built-up goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   Senior leaders primarily care about what you can produce tomorrow, not necessarily what you've produced today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Solution: Be Your Own Free Agent
To protect your career, you must act like the free agent of your career, always prioritizing your own interests first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. It's not wrong to put yourself first and your employer second, but do it smartly by developing all necessary skills and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This embodies the "CEO of your career" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

By keeping these lessons in mind and approaching your career with strategy and ownership, you can avoid significant pain and navigate your professional journey more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

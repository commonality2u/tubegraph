An anonymized individual, known by the Twitter handle "fur," experienced a notable employment mishap where he was set up for an interview with the very company that had just terminated him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This unusual event occurred shortly after his termination, with a recruiter contacting him to interview for the exact same position he had previously held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The company and the recruiter involved were seemingly unaware that they were engaging with their former employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The individual documented his entire [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | experience]] on Twitter in a play-by-play format, providing a humorous account of the company's apparent disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Interview Play-by-Play

The sequence of events highlighted significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]] in the company's hiring process:

*   **Initial Shock** Initially, the individual expressed disbelief that the recruiter had lined him up for an interview with his former employer, stating, "I wish that I was making this up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This situation was deemed embarrassing for both the recruiter and, more so, for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Confirmed Interview** Despite the absurdity, he received a confirmed interview invitation for the same position he had been terminated from just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **A Bit of Fun** Being financially stable through freelance work and having other genuine interviews lined up, he decided to "have a little bit of fun" with the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Interview Attire** For the on-site interview, he humorously debated wearing a top hat and mustache or his old uniform to show commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. He ultimately decided to wear his old uniform and also purchased a fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of Recognition**
    *   The interview manager (hiring manager) called him to confirm the appointment but seemed to not recognize his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This indicated a surprising disconnect from the workforce, especially concerning terminated employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   Upon arrival, the person at the front desk was "unfazed" by his appearance (fake mustache), despite likely having been aware of his termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   Interestingly, his phone was still connected to the company's Wi-Fi network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   He was asked to put on a face mask for the interview, which further concealed his mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **The Interview Itself**
    *   The hiring manager was someone he had not met before, suggesting it might have been for a different position within the same company, though the original recruiter stated it was the same role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   He submitted a resume that did not list his old jobs by name, instead using a cut-and-paste of the job listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   The hiring manager kindly provided him with snacks (water, gummy bears, pretzels, beef jerky) after he mentioned skipping lunch due to nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   The interview took place in a different building, away from his direct former co-workers, making it less likely for him to be recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   The hiring manager admitted to not being "technical enough to ask you some of the hard questions," indicating a potential mismatch between managerial responsibilities and technical understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   An engineer, whom the interviewee recognized from the break room, was brought in to conduct the technical portion of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The engineer asked, "I think I've seen you around, you ever freelance here before?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, to which he replied, "I freelanced in a lot of places," without lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **The Revelation** After multiple rounds of interviews spanning several hours and receiving numerous snacks, the company finally realized that the interviewee was the same individual they had fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The hiring manager became "furious" that he hadn't disclosed his prior termination, despite the company's internal failure to recognize him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. He politely declined a gummy bear offered by the interviewee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

This entire episode highlights a severely flawed [[common_interview_mistakes | interview process]], particularly regarding internal communication and candidate screening within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The company's inability to recognize a former employee, especially one terminated just two weeks prior, suggests significant organizational disarray in their [[preparing_for_interviews_and_misleading_practices | interview preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

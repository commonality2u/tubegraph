One individual shared a particularly [[unusual_job_interview_experiences | unusual job interview experience]] where he was set up for an interview with the very company that had just fired him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This story, documented on Twitter by a user named "fur," details an unexpected and awkward interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## "fur"'s Interview Ordeal

After being fired from his job, "fur" was immediately contacted by a recruiter inviting him to interview for the exact same position with the same employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The recruiter and company appeared to be unaware that he was the recently terminated employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. "fur" decided to go along with the interview for entertainment, as he was already engaged in freelance work and had other job interviews scheduled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Preparation and Arrival

To add to the absurdity, "fur" contemplated wearing a top hat and a mustache, or his old uniform to show "commitment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He opted for his old uniform and a fake mustache for the on-site interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Upon arrival, the front desk seemed unfazed by his appearance, even when asked to put on a face mask over his mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Notably, his phone was still connecting to the company's Wi-Fi network, suggesting a potential security lapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### The Interview Process

The hiring manager, whom "fur" had not met before, conducted the initial interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. "fur"'s resume for this interview did not list his previous jobs by name, instead using a copy-paste of the job listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The hiring manager was very accommodating, offering "fur" snacks because he mentioned skipping lunch due to nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The hiring manager even commented that "fur" seemed like an "ideal candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

However, the hiring manager admitted he wasn't technical enough to ask hard questions and requested an engineer join the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. While waiting for the engineer, "fur" received more snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

When an engineer joined, he seemed to recognize "fur" and asked if he had freelanced there before, to which "fur" truthfully replied he freelanced in a lot of places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The technical discussion went well because "fur" knew the job intimately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. He was then sent to another building to meet the engineering team, where he collected even more snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### The Realization

Eventually, an engineer or manager recognized him, asking: "Are you here to really re-interview for this job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> "fur" feigned ignorance, stating he didn't understand the "re" part and just wanted to know more about the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This interaction quickly became an "interrogation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The hiring manager returned, "furious" that "fur" hadn't mentioned he was previously fired from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. It took at least two full interviews, several hours, and numerous snacks for the company to realize they were interviewing the same person they had fired just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. "fur" offered the manager a gummy bear, which was declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. It is assumed that "fur" was then asked to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Reflections on the Experience

This [[unusual_job_interview_experiences | unusual job interview experience]] highlights several potential issues with the company's internal processes and recruitment:

> "I mean it's it's it's just mind-blowing if this manager is really that disconnected from his workforce that he doesn't even know the names of the people that he just got done terminating." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

*   **Lack of Internal Communication:** The company contacted a recently terminated employee for the same role within two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Recruiter Oversight:** While a recruiter might not recognize every name, some level of cross-referencing for recent terminations seems advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Hiring Manager Disconnect:** The hiring manager did not recognize the candidate, despite being potentially involved in the previous termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The manager also admitted to not being technical enough to assess candidates for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This suggests a potential breakdown in the [[common_job_interview_mistakes | common job interview mistakes]] that could lead to poor hiring decisions.
*   **Security Concerns:** The fact that "fur"'s phone still connected to the company's Wi-Fi network two weeks after his termination indicates a security vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

This anecdote serves as an entertaining example of how a lack of internal coordination can lead to an [[unusual_job_interview_experiences | unusual job interview experience]] and highlights [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags in job interviews]] (from the company's side) regarding their interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

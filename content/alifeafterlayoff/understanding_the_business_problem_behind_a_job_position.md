When asked "Why should we hire you?" in an interview, it's crucial for job seekers to understand the underlying business problem the company is trying to solve with the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. This question is often feared, but a corporate recruiter indicates that understanding the company's needs is key to a successful answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Why the Question is Asked
The question "Why should we hire you?" (or similar questions like "Why do you want to work for us?") is asked to gauge if the job seeker understands what the company is trying to accomplish with the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. It's not about receiving a generic answer, but a targeted response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:06">[01:47:06]</a>.

## The Origin of a Job Opening
From a hiring manager's perspective, a new position is typically created in a department to solve a business gap or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This could be due to:
*   Replacing someone leaving the organization or moving into a different role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>.
*   A new business need requiring a new headcount, which involves creating a business case for the problem that needs to be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>.
*   A new project, launching a new division, or a new project coming down the pipeline for which the department lacks bandwidth or specific skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:01">[04:01:01]</a>.

Once a business case is made, it generates a requisition that gets posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Recruiters then collaborate closely with the hiring manager in an "intake call" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. During this call, they review job specifications, discuss critical tasks for the position, and identify the skills needed for a candidate to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This process helps the recruiter create an ideal candidate profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, which ultimately defines the business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## How to Uncover the Business Problem
To effectively answer why you should be hired, you need to know what business problem the company is solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This provides the insight needed to make a strong case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

Key ways to identify the business problem include:
*   **Analyzing the job description:** Pay close attention to the job description, highlighting major points that indicate what the business is looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Listening during preliminary screens:** During your interview with the initial recruiter, listen very closely to what they say. They will provide keys and insight that you can use in the next interview with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## Connecting Your Experience to the Business Problem
A three-part formula is suggested for answering "Why should we hire you?":

1.  **Understand why the position is open:** This means understanding the business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. You need to understand how you would fit into solving that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Link your past experiences to the business problem:** If the company needs someone for a particular program or project, highlight how your background has solved similar problems in other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Demonstrate a track record of success doing it before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
3.  **Show how you can solve the same problem for them:** Illustrate how you would approach and solve the problem for *their* organization. For example, explain, "I've worked on this type of project before; this is how I would solve it â€“ I would do this, this, and this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. This helps the interviewer visualize you in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Generic Answers
Job seekers often make the mistake of giving generic responses like "I'm a team player," "I give 110%," "I'm a fast learner," or "I achieve results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. These phrases are considered "fluffy" and don't provide specific information about the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

Instead, the goal is to tie business results you've achieved in the past directly to the business problem the prospective employer is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This specific approach demonstrates why you are the best candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

New leadership and CEO strategies often lead to significant shifts in company structure and employment, particularly in the tech industry, which can have profound [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | effects on employees]] and career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. These changes are often driven by a need for corporate turnaround and cost reduction.

## Intel as a Case Study

Intel, described as a "steaming hot mess," has undergone major [[company_performance_metrics_and_their_impact_on_employment | cost-cutting measures]] and [[the_role_of_recruitment_and_layoffs | layoffs]] to stay afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

*   **Massive Layoffs:** Under new CEO Li Bhutan, Intel is reportedly cutting 20% of its workforce, impacting 21,000 roles, making it the company's largest layoff to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This follows a 15% staff reduction the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **The Role of CEO Li Bhutan:** Li Bhutan was previously on Intel's board of directors, advocating for the reduction of "corporate bloat" and bureaucracy to facilitate quicker decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. He left the board before the previous major layoff announcement and was then tapped to return as CEO after the former CEO was let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **CEO Vision and Contradictions:** Li Bhutan's stated goal is to make Intel an "engineering-focused company" and "retain and recruit top talents engineering" to empower innovation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. However, this vision is difficult to achieve amidst mass [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | layoffs]], which can lead talented employees to question their commitment to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Strategic Restructuring and its Consequences

New leadership often initiates significant organizational changes, impacting various employee layers and overall career progression.

*   **Targeting Middle Management:** Many layoffs target middle management positions to "remove bureaucracy" and "flatten organizations," thereby reducing salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Tech companies have been "notorious and brutal" in eliminating this leadership layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Impact on Career Paths:** While cutting middle management might seem beneficial on paper, it removes a crucial promotion path for individual contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Without this layer, employees struggle to gain the experience needed to advance to director-level positions, potentially leading to a future shortage of senior candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Financial Pressures:** Intel's massive layoffs were necessitated by significant financial losses, including a $1.6 billion loss in Q2 2024 and an even more staggering $16.6 billion loss in Q3 of the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. These losses prompted a "right sizing" of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Warning Signs for Employees

The arrival of a new CEO or senior leader often signals a period of instability and potential job insecurity.

[!WARNING|New Leadership = Instability]
When a new CEO or senior leader is brought into an organization, it is a "major warning sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. These leaders typically arrive with their own vision, implement new strategies, bring in their own team, and often make "wholesale changes," including "massive layoffs and major corporate restructuring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Such changes can fracture an organization, leaving it "never the same afterward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Broader Market Trends

The [[impact_of_economic_changes_on_employment_opportunities | overall trend]] of layoffs in tech has been decreasing from its peak in 2022-2023, showing some stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. However, companies now have a much shorter outlook, hiring for immediate needs and laying off employees once those services are no longer required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

*   **Short-Term Employment:** The concept of long-term employment at a single company is becoming rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Companies are not investing in employees for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **The "Gravy Train is Over":** The tech job market, which experienced "bidding wars" for employees from Q3 2020 to Q1 2022, is now much more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It's no longer an "easy payday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **[[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | Recruitment and Employment Experience Trends]]:** The current market is characterized by "ghosting," "ghost jobs," and "super long interview processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Even highly qualified candidates doing "all the right things" are struggling to secure positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Impact of AI:** Disruptive technologies, particularly AI, pose a risk to junior and mid-level developer jobs if individuals lack a high degree of competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. AI is increasingly integrated into products and services, and its evolution needs to be monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_mitigating_layoff_impacts | Mitigating Risk and Reclaiming Control]]

Employees need to take proactive steps to navigate this challenging environment.

*   **Skill Assessment:** It is crucial to constantly assess one's skills against market demands and stay updated with evolving technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Networking and Job Search Tools:** Leveraging professional networks, crafting concise resumes, and engaging in targeted networking are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Neglecting networks until they are needed is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   **Vetting Companies:** Before accepting new opportunities, thoroughly vet companies by examining their past behavior, including recent layoffs, restructurings, funding, and leadership changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This emphasizes the [[importance_of_company_accountability_in_hiring_and_layoffs | importance of company accountability]] in hiring practices.
*   **Proactive Career Management:** Take proactive steps to manage your career, even if you feel comfortable in your current job, as you "might not be caught up in one of these layoffs yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Persistence and Attitude:** Despite the difficult market, people are still getting hired, even those in their 50s and 60s into high-paying roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Consistency and a positive attitude are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE|Personal Experience]
A specific example highlights the challenges: a professional left a stable job for a smaller e-commerce company, only to be laid off in a 20% reduction in force exactly 30 days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. He now faces a "worst tech job market" and questions his future in the industry despite being highly qualified and actively networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Such experiences demonstrate the minimal care companies show for the [[employer_hiring_strategies_and_ethics | impact of their hiring and layoff ethics]] on individuals' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

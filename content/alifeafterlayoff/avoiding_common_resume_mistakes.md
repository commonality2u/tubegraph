When crafting a resume, it's crucial to understand what recruiters and hiring managers are looking for, especially given the short amount of time they spend reviewing each application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. While there isn't a single "right" way to write a resume, the ultimate test is whether it's yielding the desired results, such as landing job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. This article provides [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid | resume writing tips]] from a corporate recruiter's perspective, focusing on how resumes are quickly screened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

## Template Choices

One significant [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid | mistake to avoid]] is using outdated templates designed by graphic designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>. These templates, often found on sites like Canva.com or large resume hubs, frequently include graphics, charts, and "cute" presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. Such designs can distract from the resume's primary purpose: allowing recruiters to quickly find the information they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.

It is generally recommended to:
*   Use a very simple template, such as one from Microsoft Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>.
*   Choose a one-column layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a>.
*   Avoid bright, flashy colors and graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:14">[02:18:14]</a>.
*   Select clean, easy-to-read fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:44">[02:23:44]</a>.
*   Stick to basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>.
*   For most professions, a resume should be "relatively boring" in its design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

The only exception for a more creative approach is if you are a graphic designer or in another creative field where such a presentation might be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:03">[02:36:03]</a>. However, even then, using a template designed by another graphic designer might not be the best representation of your own skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. The main issue with these templates is that they are often created by individuals unfamiliar with how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) parse resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:13">[02:52:13]</a>.

## Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Compliance

To ensure your resume is ATS compliant:
*   **Contact Information**: Avoid making your contact information horizontal; instead, format it vertically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:09">[03:04:09]</a>. ATS systems typically struggle to read horizontal layouts and parse them correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:06">[03:08:06]</a>. A vertical layout allows the system to find and populate information more cleanly into the correct fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>. If you find yourself manually entering a lot of data when applying for jobs because the ATS isn't parsing your information cleanly, your resume is likely not ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:25">[03:20:25]</a>.

## Content and Customization

Instead of writing a resume as a summary of every career accomplishment, adopt a "profiling" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:04">[03:46:04]</a>. This means tailoring your resume to a specific role, delivering exactly what the employer is seeking, rather than hoping they find something they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Focus on information relevant to the hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

[[optimizing_and_customizing_your_resume | Customization]] is a crucially important step, especially in today's competitive job market, particularly for remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:06">[04:28:06]</a>. While it may feel uncomfortable, customizing your resume is necessary to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:05">[04:47:05]</a>. This strategy provides a competitive advantage over others who may not bother to customize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:09">[05:00:09]</a>.

When [[improving_resume_clarity_and_conciseness | improving resume clarity and conciseness]]:
*   **Avoid Wordiness**: Massive blocks of text can cause eyes to glaze over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers are likely to skip over overly wordy resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Be concise and selective with your words and how they are laid out on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Proprietary Language**: Do not use titles, project names, division names, or product types that are unique to your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. The broader market will not understand these terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Instead, boil down concepts into clear, common language for your industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Remove Generic Terminology**: Avoid fluffy terms like "team player" or "great organizational skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Recruiters will assess important competencies in an interview anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. Focus on actionable terms and concepts related to the job you are doing and applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job, aiming to secure an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Iterative Improvement

If your resume is not yielding results, be open to redoing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Repeated rejections at the application level often indicate that your resume is not working effectively, especially if you believe you are a clear fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. It's important to be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're applying to by closely examining the job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Ensure your resume clearly conveys this fit to maximize your chances of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

Remember the "plan, do, check, and adjust" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. If your resume isn't working, make changes, try different versions, and continue to refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

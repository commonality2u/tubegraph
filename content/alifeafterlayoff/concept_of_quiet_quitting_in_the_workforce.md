The term "quiet quitting" has emerged as a new concept in the workforce, seen as an extension of [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | the great resignation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While some might initially perceive it as laziness, it represents a deeper shift in employee mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?
[[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | Quiet quitting]] is defined as effectively quitting your job without physically leaving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It involves employees reducing their output to the minimum acceptable standard required for their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This means doing just enough to get by, akin to the "proverbial mouse wiggle," without taking on additional tasks or burdens beyond the basic requirements, thereby relieving personal stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Not Advocated, But Explained
The speaker clarifies that he does not advocate for quiet quitting, instead suggesting that individuals treat themselves like a "free agent" and strategically upgrade their employment situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, he emphasizes that [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | quiet quitting]] is a legitimate phenomenon worth understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Rise of "Coasting Culture"
An article from Business Insider discusses this concept, highlighting a shift towards a "coasting culture" in corporate America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This shift is driven by employees making a "considered, deliberate decision" to no longer let companies exploit them for free labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Reasons for Quiet Quitting
Why would someone opt to [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | quietly quit]] instead of just [[steps_to_quitting_a_job_properly | quitting]]?
*   **Work as a Paycheck**: During the pandemic, many professionals began to view their jobs solely as a source of income to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Ideal Conditions**: A strong labor market has provided job security, while the increase in remote work has made it harder for managers to monitor effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Feeling Exploited**: After years of working late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty, employees are pushing back against the "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. They are mounting a "secret resistance" against the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Burnout**: Employees who remained after significant layoffs often had to pick up the slack, leading to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

> "During the pandemic employees came to see work as just that for the first time in their lives they viewed their jobs as a source for a paycheck to support themselves and their family and not a higher falling that demands their utmost devotion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>

## Historical Context and Market Shift
Historically, there has been a pendulum swing in the employment market, long buried on the employer's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Employers often treated human resources as tools to extract maximum productivity for minimum cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

For decades, companies would grow and become bloated, eventually leading to catastrophic events like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11, which provided excuses for mass layoffs and "reductions in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The period before 2020 saw extended growth and bloating, potentially setting the stage for cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

When the 2020 pandemic hit, many companies made ruthless cuts, often too deep, which fractured the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This created an unprecedented shift towards the employee, a change not seen since the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Companies that overzealously cut staff found themselves in a market where demand came "screaming back," leading to a sense of betrayal among employees who had dedicated years to "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Re-evaluation of Work and Generational Shifts
Employees are now re-evaluating their commitment to hustle culture, questioning if the sacrifices made were worth being "thrown out like yesterday's trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

There is also a generational component to this shift. Baby Boomers are largely exiting the workforce, being replaced by Gen Z, whose mentality about the workplace is "completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Companies are now compelled to re-evaluate how they approach work and treat their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

The days of remaining loyal to one company for 20 years are becoming antiquated, potentially leading to employees falling behind on compensation unless they receive frequent promotional raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The pendulum has swung, giving employees more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. As an extension of [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | the great resignation]], many are unwilling to work long hours or weekends, choosing instead to establish employment boundaries and practice the "coasting mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

> "My company's not my family, but now prompted by fears of the pandemic many Americans have shed those expectations and the means they aren't putting up with the grueling hours that they were happy to put in just a few years ago." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>

## Conclusion
While the speaker doesn't encourage [[trends_in_employment_great_resignation_and_quiet_quitting | quiet quitting]], he encourages individuals to re-evaluate their work situation if they are unhappy with their treatment, compensation, or hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. He suggests keeping resumes updated and strategically planning an exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. However, for those with built-up equity like vacation time or 401(k)s, who find quitting not the best option, dialing back work to the minimum acceptable output is a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This is partly because employers are often unable to backfill positions, viewing "some output as better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

The underlying shift is from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Employees, tired of "leaning in" for decades, are now "leaning back" to avoid burnout and regain work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

If you're wondering if you're on shaky ground at work, there are several [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | signs]] that you might be getting fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Ryan, from Life After Layoff, draws on 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting for major corporations to share indicators that your job may be on the rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Recognizing these [[signs you need a new job | signs]] early can help you develop a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

## Leading Indicators of Job Instability

### Declining Metrics
A primary leading indicator is when your metrics are significantly down, especially compared to your co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. In major corporations, departmental metrics like sales quotas or other measurable targets are often published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. If your productivity is noticeably behind the rest of the group, your name is likely on a list somewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. If you're underperforming your peer group, you should either focus on improving your performance or reevaluate if the role is the right fit for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>. Consistent lower output will draw scrutiny from your boss and their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>.

### Boss's Sudden Displeasure
Another indicator is if your boss is suddenly displeased with the work you are producing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. You should proactively meet with your boss to understand expectations better and ask for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Continually displeasing your boss can put a target on your back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Work Redistribution
If your work is being redistributed, such as clients you supported being pulled away or projects you were involved with being removed, it's a clear [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | sign]] that you are not meeting expectations and faith in your ability to perform has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:09">[02:16:09]</a>.

### Exclusion from Key Discussions
You might also notice that you are no longer invited to key discussions or meetings that you once attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:02">[02:34:02]</a>. If another person or your boss starts taking your place in meetings with groups you used to support, it's often a negative indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:07">[02:39:07]</a>. This means your boss may be doing damage control or distancing you from the project and team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>.

### "Weirdness" from Supporting Groups
If you start noticing strange behavior from cross-functional groups you support, such as a leader acting strange or withholding information, it's a [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | sign]] that things might not be going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:09">[03:01:09]</a>.

## HR-Related Indicators

### Drastically Lower Performance Appraisals
A significant [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flag]] is a sudden, drastic slip in your performance appraisals, especially if you had a history of decent scores and are caught off guard by a much lower, critical appraisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:01">[03:25:01]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Manager Documenting Dismissal
> When your performance appraisals slip, your manager is likely starting to document your dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. HR professionals, when approached by a manager seeking to terminate an employee for underperformance, will review the employee's file, particularly past performance appraisals, for documented declines in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>. A sudden decision to terminate without a documented history of declining performance can appear rash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:03">[04:09:03]</a>. HR will typically push back on managers to begin documented coaching sessions and ensure these are reflected in performance appraisals to create a paper trail for defending an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Performance Improvement Process (PIP)
As a last resort for performance-related issues, HR departments often place an employee on a Performance Improvement Process (PIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. A PIP is a defined period with measurable goals that must be met to keep your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>. Failure to hit the very defined metrics set forth in the PIP typically results in termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. While improving performance during a PIP can lead to coming off the plan and continuing employment, being put on a PIP is a huge [[identifying_red_flags_at_your_job | red flag]] and should be taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Taking Action
If you notice any of these [[signs you need to quit your job | signs]], you should start thinking about what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Whether you choose to address your performance issues or make a change, it will require concerted effort and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:03">[05:44:03]</a>. You must take action to either salvage the situation or "cut bait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:03">[05:49:03]</a>.

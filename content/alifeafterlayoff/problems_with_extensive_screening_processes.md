Extensive screening processes in recruitment can be problematic, often indicating a poor-quality employer and a disregard for candidate experience. These processes can be time-consuming, offer low chances of success for candidates, and sometimes even exploit applicants for free labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41">[00:41]</a>.

## Issues with Interview Assignments

One form of extensive screening involves giving candidates lengthy assignments instead of traditional interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. While proponents argue that this method assesses a candidate's actual work ability, it is often heavily criticized for being unfair and [[impact_of_poor_candidate_experience | uncandidate-focused]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

The speaker highlights several problems:
*   **Time Commitment** Candidates might be asked to spend an entire weekend, or even eight to twelve hours, on a presentation, project, or assignment, including research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Low Success Rate** If ten candidates are asked to complete such an assignment, only one will be hired, meaning the chance of getting an offer is at best 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. The cost-benefit ratio for the candidate is not favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Expectations** Some assignments may even ask candidates to contact existing employees within the company for their views, which is impractical and inconsiderate of the employees' time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Candidate Focus** Companies might believe these assignments are a good idea on paper, but in reality, they demonstrate a lack of focus on the [[impact_of_poor_candidate_experience | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

Candidates should carefully consider their interest in a job before committing to such an assignment due to the significant time investment and low probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Extreme Multi-Stage Screening Processes: The Topball Example

The company "Topball" exemplifies an extreme multi-stage screening process, which they openly advertise on their careers page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This process is excessively long and demanding, revealing multiple [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] about the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

Topball's screening process includes:
1.  **Personality and Language Screening**: Assesses comprehensive English language skills, communication, personality traits, and passion for work. Only 26.4% of applicants pass this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
2.  **In-depth Skill Review**: Tests technical and problem-solving knowledge through various assessments. Only 7.4% of initial applicants pass this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
3.  **Live Screen**: Candidates are interviewed by experts in their functional domain, who provide specific live exercises to assess problem-solving, experience, communication, and creativity. A mere 3.6% of initial applicants pass this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
4.  **Test Projects**: Candidates are assigned a time-bound test project, which can take between one to three weeks to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This stage provides real-world scenarios for candidates to demonstrate competency. Only 3.2% of initial applicants pass this final step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### Criticisms of Topball's Process

*   **Unpaid Labor**: The demand for a one-to-three-week test project is "absolutely ridiculous" if candidates are not compensated for their time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Property**: There is a risk that companies use candidates' test projects to solve their own business problems without hiring or compensating the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   **Excessive Length**: The entire screening process can take between two to five weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Low Probability of Offer**: The company proudly advertises that only 3.2% of candidates complete and pass the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

Job seekers should question whether such a lengthy and low-probability process is worth their valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. These types of processes are clear indicators of low-quality employers and opportunities that should generally be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Engaging with such employers can lead to a bad experience, potentially weakening a resume, and making it harder to find better opportunities in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

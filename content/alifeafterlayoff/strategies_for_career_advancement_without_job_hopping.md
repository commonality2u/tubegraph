Historically, [[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | job hopping]] has been a common approach for employees to rapidly increase their salaries, particularly earlier in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This strategy gained significant traction, especially during the peak job market for job seekers around 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. During this period, industries like tech saw roles, such as software developers, become extremely hot, allowing individuals early in their careers to secure substantial salary increases by moving between roles quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. At its peak in October/November 2022, job switchers saw an average increase of 7.7% in wages, compared to over 2% lower for those who stayed in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

However, current economic data suggests that the "good times" for this approach may be ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The Wall Street Journal, citing employment data from the Federal Reserve, has speculated that [[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | job hopping]] is no longer tracking well for the average employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The market began to shift around May 2023, with employers actively trying to reduce wages and offers becoming more difficult to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. By January 2025, the incentive for leaving jobs for higher pay is significantly diminished, with wage growth for job switchers only marginally higher than for those who stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Understanding Job Hopping

[[job_hopping_strategies_for_career_growth | Job hopping]] is defined as moving from job to job in a relatively short amount of time, often staying at the same professional level without definitive career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Employers often view it negatively, as an indicator that an individual may not commit to a role long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. While it can offer quick salary gains early on, there's a point of diminishing returns, after which salary growth slows, and individuals may need to defend their frequent job changes on their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

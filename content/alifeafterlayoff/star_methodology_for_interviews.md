The STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) methodology is a tried and true method for answering [[key_indicators_and_questions_during_interviews | interview questions]] by framing responses in a [[storytelling_in_interviews | storytelling]] format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Hiring managers prefer candidates who can tell stories, and being a good storyteller can help impress the interviewer and lead to a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. When preparing for an interview, it's highly recommended to keep the STAR methodology in mind for structuring your answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### S - Situation
The "S" stands for Situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This is the introduction of the "hero" into the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It provides the listener with context as to why you were in that particular situation to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### T - Task
The "T" stands for Task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This part explains what the "hero" (you) was going to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### A - Action
The "A" stands for Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This describes the specific actions you took to accomplish the mission or task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### R - Result
The "R" stands for Result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This is the "happily ever after" â€“ what was the outcome of your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Being honest and giving a great example in this format is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Greatest Professional Accomplishment:** For this question, strategically choose an accomplishment that is most related to the job you are applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Then, provide a STAR-formatted example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

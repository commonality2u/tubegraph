When faced with the question "What's your salary expectation?" in an interview, knowing how to respond is crucial for a successful outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. An incorrect answer can lead to rejection, as can completely avoiding the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This guide provides [[strategies for answering salary expectation questions | strategies for answering salary expectation questions]] to navigate this common interview dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters ask about salary expectations to determine if a candidate's desired compensation fits within the established salary band for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This information is typically included in the initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. It's generally not a trick question; recruiters genuinely want to ensure that if an offer is extended, the candidate will accept and be enthusiastic about the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. An offer below a candidate's expectations can lead to dissatisfaction and a quick departure, requiring the recruiter to refill the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This makes the salary discussion important for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Understanding Salary Bands

Major corporations utilize salary bands, which define the minimum, midpoint, and maximum compensation for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These bands are often based on local market wage surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Another key concept is "internal equity," which ensures that individuals in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same, preventing significant pay disparities between new hires and long-term employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Scenarios for Salary Expectations

### When Your Salary Expectation is Higher than the Range

If your expectation is significantly higher than the role's salary range, you risk being moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Slight Difference**: If the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000), some [[salary negotiation strategies | negotiation]] might occur before the interview process continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Recruiters might propose hypothetical scenarios to gauge your flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Significant Difference**: A large gap (e.g., $25,000) makes it unlikely an offer can be made that satisfies you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. In such cases, a recruiter might express that expectations differ for the role but offer to keep you in mind for more "enriched" future positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidate Exception**: For highly talented "superstar" candidates, a recruiter might still forward your resume with your accurate (higher) salary expectations to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In rare instances, the hiring manager might agree to "enrich" the role to a higher level (e.g., Level 2 or 3), which opens up wider salary ranges and allows for a higher offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. However, this is an exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Be Honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
> Do not attempt a "bait and switch" tactic by misrepresenting your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Ensure there's a baseline understanding of salary during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### When Your Salary Expectation is Lower than the Range

If your expected compensation is below the company's established salary range, it can be a positive outcome for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The company will likely offer you the minimum of their salary band, resulting in a nice raise and excitement for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This scenario often occurs when candidates come from smaller or less reputable companies that don't offer competitive market wages, or when they are stepping into a higher-level role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Refusing to Answer the Question

Refusing to answer the salary expectation question or providing vague, evasive answers is almost always a path to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Recruiters will not put you through the full interview process without knowing if a deal can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, and they may suspect you are hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## [[How to prepare for salary discussions in interviews | Preparing for Salary Discussions]]

To effectively answer the salary expectation question, you need to know three key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:

1.  **Average Salary Range in the Open Market**: Research the average salary for similar roles in your local area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Use resources like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Ensure you compare jobs in your specific region, as salaries vary significantly by location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **What the Company Expects to Pay**: Try to ascertain the company's expected salary for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom-Line Salary Expectation**: Determine the absolute minimum salary you are willing to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This is your walk-away point and is not necessarily a number you share with the recruiter, but one you need to know for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## [[How to answer salary expectation questions in interviews | Strategies for Answering]] the Question

### 1. Directly State Your Expectation

If you are confident in your market value and believe the company's range aligns with your expectations, you can simply provide your desired number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Remember that this number will be used throughout the process, so ensure it's reasonable and something you can commit to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### 2. Frame Your Answer with Market Research

If you suspect the company might offer a lowball salary, or your expectation is significantly higher than what they might be anticipating, frame your answer based on your market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:

> "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between 90 to 110 thousand. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

This approach puts the onus on the company to disclose if their compensation is below market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, allowing you to decide if you want to work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### 3. Turn the Question Back to the Recruiter

If you're interested in the opportunity and potentially willing to accept a lower salary, or if you're unsure of the company's range, try to get the recruiter to provide a ballpark first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:

> "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within, and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

A recruiter will often provide this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, be prepared with an answer if they push back and insist you go first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **Avoid Ambiguity**: Don't be ambiguous or try to delay the salary discussion until the offer stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This rarely works well and can frustrate hiring managers who have invested time in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Don't Frustrate the Recruiter**: If you sense a recruiter is becoming frustrated with your responses, provide a clear answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Pushing too hard can lead to being placed in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

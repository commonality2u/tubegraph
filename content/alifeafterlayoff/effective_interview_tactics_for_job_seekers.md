Understanding the unspoken language of recruiters can significantly [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_gain_a_competitive_edge | enhance a job seeker's chances]] of landing a dream job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This guide, based on insights from a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, reveals what recruiters say versus what they actually mean during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Types of Recruiters
It's important to distinguish between two main types of recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:

*   **Headhunters (Third-Party Recruiters)**
    *   Contracted by companies to place positions on contingency, meaning they are paid only upon successful placement of a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   Their fee is typically 15% to 25% of the hired candidate's first-year income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   Generally have less in-depth knowledge of the specific role compared to internal recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

*   **Corporate Recruiters (Internal Recruiters)**
    *   Full-time employees of the company, often part of a talent acquisition or HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Paid a salary, and their primary goal is to find the best possible fit for their hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   They typically support specific functional groups and work repeatedly with the same hiring managers, leading to a deep understanding of position requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   The first interview with a corporate recruiter is usually a screening to assess baseline competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The insider information provided focuses specifically on the internal recruiter's interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Recruiter Statements: What They Say vs. What They Mean

### "What do you know about the company?"
*   **What they say:** A standard opening question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** This is a crucial indicator of your interest and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   **Actionable Tip:** Always come prepared with an understanding of what the company does and the position's nature. Failure to do so is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This is part of [[strategies_for_preparing_for_job_interviews | preparing for job interviews]].

### "Do you have specific skills or competencies?"
*   **What they say:** Assessing if you meet baseline requirements for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** These are non-negotiable requirements from the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   **Actionable Tip:** If you lack a required skill, it's unlikely you'll move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, in some cases, other strong attributes might compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Repeatedly rephrasing a question or bringing you back to it
*   **What they say:** Trying to get a specific answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** You are missing the mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Each question assesses a specific competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   **Actionable Tip:** Stop, listen carefully, and recalculate your answer. It's acceptable to ask for clarification, e.g., "Can you please give me an idea of what it is you're looking for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### No follow-up questions after you ramble
*   **What they say:** Listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** You are likely moving to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Long-windedness is considered a "kiss of death" as it indicates an inability to communicate concisely and influence senior leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   **Actionable Tip:** Answer directly and concisely. Let the interviewer probe for more information if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This is a key [[strategies_for_effective_job_search_and_interviews | strategy for interviews]].

### "What is your compensation expectation?"
*   **What they say:** Asking about your salary requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** This is a good sign that you are a potential fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If they *don't* ask, you're almost certainly in the "no" pile as they've already determined you're not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   **Actionable Tip:** Be honest with your expectation. If your expectation is slightly higher, they might tell you the actual range and ask if you'd be open to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   **Warning:** If your expectation is more than $10,000-$15,000 apart, they may say, "This position is scoped a little lower than you're expecting, and if you don't mind, I'll give you a call when I have a more enriched role." This means they can't afford you, and the position is likely not suitable anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Stand firm in your realistic requirements with good data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### "Do you have any questions for me?"
*   **What they say:** Offering you a chance to ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** The interview is effectively over, and they likely already know if they're sending you to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. No amount of selling at this point will change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   **Actionable Tip:** Use this as an opportunity to gather information to make an informed decision about the company and ensure a mutual fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Trying to "sell" you the job and get you excited
*   **What they say:** Describing the benefits and excitement of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** They think you're a potentially great fit and are already pre-selling you in case an offer is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This is a very [[successful_job_interview_indicators | successful job interview indicator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Wrapping up the interview in 10-15 minutes
*   **What they say:** Ending the interview efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** You are likely not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Recruiters often know within five to seven minutes whether a candidate is a decent fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Actionable Tip:** Make your best first impression and come out of the gate strong to get past the first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### "We've had a lot of interest, we just started interviewing, and we'll be back to you whenever we've completed all of our interviews."
*   **What they say:** Explaining the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **What they mean:** You are probably not moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. A particularly good candidate will be pre-sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   **Positive Indicator:** If the recruiter introduces the hiring manager and tells you they're putting you on their calendar, it's a very good sign that you're moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

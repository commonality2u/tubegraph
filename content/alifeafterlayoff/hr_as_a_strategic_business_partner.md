Many employees hold a preconceived notion that [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | Human Resources]] (HR) is primarily an employee advocate, designed to be "on our side" or a friend to confide in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. While many HR professionals are compassionate individuals who believe in doing the right thing, there is a fundamental truth about the HR function that reveals its true purpose in an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This perspective, often perceived as the "ugly truth," stems from HR's core alignment with business strategy rather than solely employee welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## HR's Foundational Role

At its core, the [[human_resources_and_employee_relations | Human Resources]] function is a business department, not originally established to be a department for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. The term "human resources" itself is disliked by some professionals in the field, including the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Historically, personnel departments, from which modern HR evolved 80 to 100 years ago, were created to staff large corporations during the industrial revolution. Their purpose was to ensure the business had the necessary resources to produce products, not to advocate for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.

### Primary Purpose: Risk Mitigation and Compliance

The ultimate driving mission of all HR departments is to [[risk_mitigation_as_a_core_hr_function | mitigate risk]], implement risk avoidance, and ensure compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. This means keeping the company out of legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. When an employee reports an issue, especially a sensitive or potentially legal one like harassment, HR is obligated to act to minimize risk, as they become liable once aware of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. Venting to HR without strategic thought is not recommended, as they will primarily listen for legal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

### Secondary Purpose: Strategic Business Alignment

The next tier of HR's purpose is strategic alignment with business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. HR acts as a strategic business partner to senior leadership, often sitting on the executive council and participating in closed-door meetings with presidents and CEOs to align talent with overall business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Their role involves looking at organizational structure and ensuring the right people are in place to achieve the executive team's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### Impact of Strategic Alignment on Employees

This strategic alignment often leads to [[impact_of_hr_decisions_on_careers | adverse employment decisions]], such as layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. If an employee's position or contributions no longer align with the company's strategic direction, they may receive a "pink slip" even if they are not a "bad employee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. At this level, it is purely a business decision, which can appear cold and calculated, contributing to HR's negative reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

HR's role in layoffs often involves laying out workforce data on spreadsheets, where individuals become numbers and data points based on core competencies and strategic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. This is why [[issues_with_hrs_role_in_layoff_meetings | HR is often the bearer of bad news]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### Attracting, Developing, and Retaining Talent

The final purpose of HR, which is most familiar to employees, is to attract, develop, and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. This includes functions like recruitment, establishing business practices and policies (which also fall under compliance), benefits administration, and general service-oriented support (e.g., paycheck issues, time off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. It is at these lower, more local levels that one typically finds the compassionate HR professionals who are genuinely interested in helping employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. However, as one moves higher in the organization, HR becomes more strategic and calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

## Employee Perception vs. Reality

Many common [[human_resources_myths_and_reality | Human Resources Myths and Reality]] stem from the misconception that HR is primarily an employee advocate. When an employee experiences an adverse employment decision, feelings of bitterness, anger, or being jaded often arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This can lead to a sense of betrayal, especially if an employee has dedicated many years to a company, trusting it to do the right thing for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

While there are certainly "cold" or "calculated" individuals within HR, it's crucial for employees to objectively assess situations and take ownership of their own career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Bitterness can prevent an individual from transmuting negative energy and positioning themselves differently moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

### Navigating HR Interactions

It is advisable to resolve issues without involving HR if possible, especially personality conflicts or general complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. However, for legal issues or situations that could lead to personal liability (e.g., harassment), reporting to HR is crucial for self-protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. For routine matters like benefits or paycheck issues, HR is available to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

Ultimately, employees must treat themselves as "free agents" and take control of their careers, rather than being at the mercy of an organization to remain gainfully employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. This proactive approach helps reduce the [[impact_of_hr_decisions_on_careers | impact of HR decisions on careers]] and fosters a more independent professional journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.

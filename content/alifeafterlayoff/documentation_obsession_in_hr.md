While [[human_resources_myths_and_truths | Human Resources]] (HR) departments sometimes deserve their negative reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, it's important to understand the less visible aspects of their operations. This article delves into one of the key [[shady_practices_of_hr_departments | shady practices]] of HR: their relentless obsession with documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

At lower organizational levels, HR can be an ally, with many professionals genuinely caring about the employee experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. However, a universal truth about HR departments is their focus on documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## The Documentation Process
Your company's [[human_resources_myths_and_truths | human resources]] department is "utterly obsessed" with documenting every single event within the employment arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. This meticulous record-keeping begins from the very first interaction with a potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>:

*   **Application Process** The employment journey starts with an application where you sign to acknowledge understanding and truthfulness of the information provided, including legal disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Offer Letter** Upon receiving an offer letter, you are required to read and sign off on various terms and conditions, often filled with legal jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Onboarding & Training** Once employed, processes like background checks require additional signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Orientation sessions often involve reviewing policies and documents that also require your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The employee handbook, too, has a space for your signature to confirm receipt and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Employment** Throughout your tenure, performance appraisals and documented coaching sessions will also require your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Exit Process** Even when you exit the company, additional signatures are required, especially for severance packages which come with their own terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

## The Purpose of Documentation
The underlying reason for HR's obsession with documentation and obtaining your signature is clear:
> [H]ere's the bottomline answer everything that they do is designed to [[role_of_hr_in_risk_management_and_compliance | limit their liability]] and potentially build a case against you whether they have to use it or they don't they're collecting all these documents they go into an employment file and if they need them at some point in the future you can guarantee they're going to point to them to defend their decision against you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>

This means that every piece of documentation you sign or that is filed, from your application to your exit papers, is maintained in an employment file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Should any issue arise, these documents can be used to defend the company's decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. It's crucial to remember that the [[human_resources_myths_and_truths | human resource]] department's primary function is to [[role_of_hr_in_risk_management_and_compliance | limit liability for the company first and foremost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

This focus on documentation is part of the larger landscape of [[corporate_culture_and_employee_oversight | corporate culture]] and employee oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Understanding this underlying motivation can help employees better [[navigating_human_resources | navigate their career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a> and be prepared for potential scenarios, such as when they [[handling_of_employee_complaints_by_hr | complain about an employee]] or the company is considering layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

Being laid off occurs when an employer eliminates a job role entirely, meaning the employee no longer has a position within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. While it can sometimes be performance-related, it is often not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Advantages of Being Laid Off

One of the primary advantages of a layoff is that individuals generally do not have to fight for unemployment benefits and are almost always eligible to receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Perhaps the biggest advantage of being laid off, compared to quitting or being fired, is the potential to qualify for a company's severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. These packages often include:
*   A lump sum of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   Continuation of benefits for a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
*   Access to outplacement services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

Additionally, depending on one's work performance, individuals who are laid off might be eligible for rehire by the company in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Being Laid Off

A significant disadvantage of being laid off is that it is rarely on the employee's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Many people are caught completely off guard, receiving no prior indication until they receive an email or a meeting notice with HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For high-performing individuals who are unprepared, this can be particularly devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, as most people are not adequately prepared to [[financial_planning_after_a_layoff | weather the storm of a layoff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Another drawback, especially during a mass layoff event, is facing abnormally stiff competition in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This is because many other individuals are entering the labor market simultaneously, seeking similar types of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, making it crucial for a resume to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

Despite the cause, there is often some stigma associated with being laid off in an interview setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Employers may harbor a bias, perceiving laid-off individuals as "damaged goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Scenarios and Considerations

If an individual anticipates that their industry or the broader market is softening, and their company has not yet announced [[impact_of_economic_downturns_and_layoffs | layoffs]], it may be advisable to wait rather than [[pros_and_cons_of_quitting_a_job | quit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Quitting just before a major layoff could mean missing out on a substantial severance package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

In an interview, if you were part of a mass layoff event, it is generally not necessary to over-justify it; simply stating it was a "mass reduction in force" is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. However, be prepared for potential bias from an outdated employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

The human resources (HR) function is a hotly debated subject, often viewed with bitterness, anger, and jadedness by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Many believe HR is supposed to be on their side and act as an advocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, while many HR professionals are compassionate and aim to do the right thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, there is an underlying layer to the function that employees should understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## The True Function of Human Resources

At its core, HR is a business department, not originally set up as a department *for* people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Historically, personnel departments (the precursor to HR) were formed 80 to 100 years ago to staff large corporations, advocating for the business's resource needs rather than the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

HR's primary purpose is to:
1.  **Mitigate risk, implement risk avoidance, and ensure compliance** with legal standards to keep the company out of legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
2.  **Strategically align talent with business decisions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This means ensuring the organization has the right people in place to achieve the executive team's strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
3.  **Attract, develop, and retain talent** through recruitment, establishing policies, and managing benefits administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This is the "service-oriented" HR function most employees are familiar with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The higher up in an organization, the more strategic and calculated HR decisions become, leading to a perceived coldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Emotional Impact of Strategic HR Decisions

Many adverse employment decisions, such as [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoffs]], stem from HR's strategic alignment role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. If an employee's position or contribution is not strategically aligned with the company's future direction, they may be let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This is seen as a business decision, which can appear very "cold and calculated" or [[impact_of_layoffs_on_workplace_culture | cutthroat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

HR often delivers bad news because, at a high level, employees are seen as data points or numbers on a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This can lead to feelings of betrayal, especially for long-term employees who have dedicated themselves to the company's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Employee Responses and Self-Reflection

When faced with adverse decisions, individuals often become frustrated and bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. There's a tendency to lash out and blame others due to emotional investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The speaker, an HR professional, notes that people who express extreme bitterness or anger towards HR often haven't processed or taken ownership of their own role in the situation that led to the [[emotional_and_practical_responses_to_being_laid_off | adverse employment decision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

> "If you are somebody that feels compelled enough to write a nasty email or a nasty comment...I think you really need to look at yourself and go okay why is it that you feel that way...what part of that root cause of the frustration did you create yourself?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>

It's crucial to acknowledge these feelings of anger and upset but then apply learning by objectively reflecting on one's own contributions to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Failing to heal from these "wounds" can lead to jadedness and skepticism in future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Navigating Interactions with HR

Employees need to be strategic when engaging with [[handling_of_employee_complaints_by_hr | human resources]].

*   **When to engage:** If experiencing serious issues like harassment or illegal activities, employees *should* go to HR to protect themselves legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. HR is required to act on information that poses a legal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **When to be cautious:** For performance-related issues, conflicts with a boss, or personality conflicts, it's advisable to try resolving issues at one's own level first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. HR is constantly listening for legal risks, so venting to them could inadvertently create a perceived risk that they are then obligated to escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Routine HR matters:** For benefits, paycheck issues, or policy interpretations, it's appropriate to approach HR for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Taking Ownership of Your Career

To mitigate the emotional impact of HR decisions, it is essential for employees to:
*   **Be a "free agent"**: Take ownership and control of one's career rather than letting organizations dictate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Not become complacent**: Do not blindly trust a company to always do the right thing for you, as the company will ultimately prioritize its best business decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Continuously develop**: Stay at the top of your game by preparing and practicing, akin to an athlete hitting the weight room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

By understanding the true nature of HR's function and taking a proactive approach to career management, individuals can reduce the personal impact of what may appear to be cold, calculated business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

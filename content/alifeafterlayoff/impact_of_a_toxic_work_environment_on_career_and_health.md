A [[toxic_work_environment | toxic work environment]] can "suck the life" out of an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, affecting not only themselves but also those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The constant pressure and stress from [[negative_workplace_culture | negative workplace culture]] or excessive work hours can also impact personal life, leading to missed family moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### [[Impact of toxic work environments | Impact on Career]]

A [[toxic_work_environment | toxic work environment]] can significantly set back an individual's career by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The trade-off for staying in such an environment is often not worth it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Individuals may feel like a failure in a job where they were previously effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Common [[signs_of_a_toxic_work_environment | signs of a toxic work environment]] that contribute to negative career impact include:
*   **High Voluntary Turnover** A revolving door of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Excessive Involuntary Turnover** A reputation for terminating people for minor infractions or for not meeting difficult metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Ever-Changing Targets** Goals that are constantly moving, making it impossible to succeed and creating frustrating employment experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This also means compensation tied to such insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Poor Company Reviews** Consistent negative feedback about leadership, unrealistic expectations, or poor work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Win-at-All-Costs Mentality** Prioritizing profit over ethical practices and employee well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Lack of Work-Life Balance** Routinely expecting 60+ hours of work per week, indicating understaffing or overworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Dishonesty** Leaders not adhering to core values, or co-workers fabricating situations and being willing to betray others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Co-workers Going Behind Your Back** Repeatedly reporting minor issues directly to a boss, eroding trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This can derail a career instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Excessive Gossip** Aligning with gossips can lead to a very short career, as being labeled a gossiper is hard to shed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Bad Bosses** Often, people quit bosses, not jobs, because a bad boss can negatively impact work culture the fastest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

If these issues are systematic company-wide rather than localized to one person, it is crucial to consider what is best for one's career, as individuals are "free agents" and should prioritize themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

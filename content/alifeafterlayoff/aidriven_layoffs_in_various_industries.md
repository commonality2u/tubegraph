The start of 2024 has seen a significant increase in [[current_job_market_and_rising_layoffs | layoffs]], with [[trends_in_tech_job_market_and_layoffs | Tech]] companies leading the trend, which is now expanding into other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A primary reason cited by company leaders for these [[reasons_companies_lay_off_employees | layoffs]] is the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. What was once speculation about AI taking over jobs is now a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Companies Citing AI in Layoffs

Companies are increasingly investing in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, and this investment is often linked to workforce reductions.

*   **Cisco Systems**
    Cisco Systems announced a major [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoff]] on February 14th, affecting 5% of its global workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The company plans to shift its focus to key priority areas, including artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. While not explicitly stated, the shift towards AI is implied as a reason for these cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Google**
    In January, Google announced [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoffs]] impacting hundreds in its ads division due to a switch to AI-powered sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Many individuals were [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | laid off]] or reassigned because AI was replacing their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Google has integrated generative AI features into its ads, including natural language chatbots that make customer service and sales roles redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. AI can now perform sales guidance tasks thousands of times a second, which was previously done by human account executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **IBM**
    In May 2023, IBM CEO Arvin Krishna announced a hiring freeze and plans to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. These job cuts primarily affect back-office functions, particularly in Human Resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. The transition is expected to be gradual, with 30% of non-customer-facing roles, such as finance, accounting, and HR, being affected over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   **Indian CEO Example**
    An Indian CEO replaced 90% of their support staff with AI chatbots, citing it as a tough but necessary measure that resulted in increased efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Broader Impact of AI on the Job Market

A recent survey by Resume Builder found that 44% of companies anticipate AI will replace employees in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. CEOs are actively looking for ways to implement AI aggressively into their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. An article from the previous year noted that AI eliminated nearly 4,000 jobs, as businesses quickly adopted advanced AI technology to automate various tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

The AI industry is projected to grow to over $1 trillion, driven by technological advancements like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

### Job Roles and Tasks Most Affected

AI is particularly adept at automating tasks that involve clerical, administrative, and repetitive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

*   **Clerical and Administrative Roles**: Bots are already proficient at generating HR letters, boilerplate text, and advertising copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Junior and mid-level workers performing semi-expert work are at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **Data Entry**: Anyone involved in data entry is likely at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Work and Writing**: This includes writing ad copy, first drafts of legal documents, and photorealistic imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Service**: Chatbots are already taking over online customer service roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Human Resources**: Lower-level HR functions, such as generating letters and handling routine inquiries, are vulnerable to AI replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Tech Jobs**: This category includes coding, computer programming, software engineering, and data analysis, as AI tools can produce good, clean, and efficient code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
*   **Media Jobs**: Advertising, content creation, technical writing, and journalism are already seeing impacts, with publications replacing editorial staff with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
*   **Legal Industry**: Paralegals and legal assistants are at risk, as AI can efficiently handle technical writing and standard legal documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Market Research Analysts**: AI excels at quickly analyzing and compiling large datasets into usable formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.
*   **Teachers**: ChatGPT can easily teach classes and assist with lesson planning and grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Jobs**: Financial analysts, personal financial advisors, and even accounting roles are at risk as AI can analyze trends, predict market movements, and assist with investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. Traders, whose work is often automated, may also be replaced by AI bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   **Recruiters**: AI robots are scanning applications and making decisions based on analytical processes, potentially making it harder for job seekers, especially those changing careers, to be noticed for transferable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

## Future-Proofing Your Career in the Age of AI

While the outlook may seem challenging, there are steps individuals can take to [[impact_of_layoffs_and_poor_company_practices | future-proof]] their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>:

*   **Stay Ahead of Trends**: Monitor your industry and job type. If your role is highly susceptible to AI replacement, start planning for a transition today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   **Upgrade Skills**: Seek out new skills or carve a niche that makes you less easily replaceable by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. Look at job postings to identify in-demand skills or tech stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI for Your Job**: Learn to use AI tools to your advantage to become more efficient and valuable in your role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
*   **Sharpen Your Tools**: Ensure your resume is up-to-date and effective for both human and AI screening systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
*   **Build a Personal Brand and Network**: Actively market yourself, build a personal brand, and engage in networking continuously, rather than waiting until a [[corporate_layoffs_and_their_effects_on_employees | layoff]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. Utilizing platforms like LinkedIn can help you get noticed by recruiters or even bypass them altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.

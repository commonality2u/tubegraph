If you're wondering if you're on shaky ground at work, it's important to recognize the [[signs_of_potential_termination_at_work | signs of potential termination]]. Ryan, with 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting, shares key indicators and what actions you can take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Key Indicators Your Job is on the Rocks

Several [[signs_of_potential_termination_at_work | indicators]] suggest your job might be in jeopardy, requiring you to think about a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

### 1. Your Metrics are Down
If your productivity metrics are significantly lower than your co-workers, especially in a major corporation where metrics are often published department-wide (e.g., sales quotas or other measurable targets), your name is likely on a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### 2. Your Boss is Suddenly Displeased
A sudden displeasure from your boss regarding your work indicates a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### 3. Work is Being Redistributed
If clients you once supported are being pulled away, or you're no longer involved in projects you were previously part of, it's a clear sign that faith in your ability to perform has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### 4. Exclusion from Key Discussions or Meetings
Notice if you're no longer invited to important discussions or meetings you used to attend. This often means your boss is stepping in to do damage control or distance you from a project or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### 5. "Weirdness" from Supporting Groups
If cross-functional leaders or groups you support start acting strangely towards you, or are reluctant to share information, it's a sign that things are not going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### 6. Drastically Slipping Performance Appraisals
A sudden, critical drop in your performance appraisal, especially if you had a history of good scores, is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This is usually because your manager is documenting your dismissal. HR professionals look for a documented decline in performance to limit liability, often pushing managers to establish a "paper trail" through documented coaching sessions reflected in appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### 7. Being Placed on a Performance Improvement Process (PIP)
A PIP is typically a last resort for [[performance_issues_as_indicators_of_getting_fired | performance-related issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This is a defined period with measurable goals that must be met to keep your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Failing to meet the metrics set forth in a PIP usually results in termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. While it's possible to successfully complete a PIP and improve performance, being placed on one is a serious warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Proactive Steps

If you notice any of these [[signs_of_potential_termination_at_work | signs of potential termination]], you should start thinking about what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Address Performance Issues**: If your metrics are down, focus on improving your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Communicate with Your Boss**: If your boss is displeased, be proactive. Sit down to understand expectations better and ask for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Take Action**: Whether you plan to address the performance issues or make a change, concerted effort and action are required to either salvage the situation or cut bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Securing a job interview is a significant achievement, but navigating the interview process requires careful consideration of what information to share and what to withhold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Revealing too much personal information or inappropriate details can lead to [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_job_interviews | common interview mistakes]] and may result in a candidate being rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter's experience highlights several areas candidates commonly overshare, which are often not in their best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Personal Information to Avoid Revealing

### Over-sharing Personal Facts
Candidates should avoid revealing too many personal facts about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This often indicates nervousness or a tendency to be long-winded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Employers evaluate a candidate's ability to articulate their thoughts, linking it to how they would perform in a professional business setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Concise answers, typically two to three minutes in length, are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Over-sharing can also create bias for or against a candidate, depending on the interviewer's personal views or interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. It is generally advisable to keep responses strictly related to the job at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### Revealing the Real Reason for Leaving Your Current Employer
While honesty is valued, candidates should be strategic about disclosing the exact reasons for leaving a previous job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Avoid negative framing, such as disliking a boss, finding the job boring, or feeling poorly treated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Interviewers may interpret such statements as indicators that the candidate is difficult to work with or lacks initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. It is crucial to articulate your reasons in a way that is not threatening to a potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

### Oversharing Career Plans
When asked about future career plans (e.g., "Where do you see yourself in five years?"), employers are assessing a candidate's commitment to the career path and potential for growth within the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Revealing plans to start an unrelated business or switch careers entirely can be a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Such disclosures may suggest a lack of passion for the position being interviewed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Candidates should convey passion for the type of work they are applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Indicating Desperation for Work
Whether due to a layoff or termination, conveying desperation for a job should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. A high sense of urgency can deter employers, similar to how desperation can push away desired outcomes in the dating world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Even in difficult financial situations, candidates should strive to appear calm and collected to avoid being put into the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### Revealing Your Age or How Many Years You Have Left in the Workforce
Age can be a factor in discrimination, whether a candidate is perceived as too young or too old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Candidates should be careful not to inadvertently reveal their age through details on resumes (e.g., old email addresses, dates) or by directly stating their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

Similarly, explicitly stating how many years are left in one's career (e.g., "this is my last job") can create a bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. If a hiring manager expects a long-term commitment (e.g., 10+ years) and a candidate indicates plans for only a few years, it can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

### Discussing Major Medical Issues or Disabilities
While employers have a right to know if a medical issue prohibits a candidate from meeting basic job requirements, candidates should not proactively disclose major medical issues or disabilities that do not interfere with job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Employers typically ask during the application process if a candidate can meet job requirements, and truthful answers should be given then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

Laws protect candidates from discrimination based on pregnancy or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. If a reasonable accommodation is required for a disability that does not interfere with the ability to perform the job, it is generally recommended to bring this up at the time of an offer, not during the interview itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This prevents potential inadvertent bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Candidates are hired based on their ability to perform the job requirements as outlined in the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## Political Beliefs

### Revealing Your Political Belief System
It is crucial to avoid revealing political belief systems during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. The political spectrum is wide and often highly opinionated, making it safer to stay completely out of such discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. Even if a company's mission seems to align with a candidate's values, it is impossible to know the individual viewpoints of the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## Salary History

### Disclosing Your Previous Salary
Avoid revealing your previous salary when the topic of compensation comes up, which usually happens during the recruiter phone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Disclosing past earnings can lock a candidate into a lower salary than they might otherwise command, especially if they were previously underpaid compared to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. Candidates should determine their own worth based on market value for their skills, experience, knowledge, and abilities, rather than allowing an employer to define it by past compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

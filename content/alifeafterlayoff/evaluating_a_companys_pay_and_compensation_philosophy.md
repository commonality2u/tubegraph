This article outlines key signs indicating a great company, specifically focusing on its approach to pay and compensation, which job seekers should evaluate during the interviewing process to find a high-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Signs of an Outstanding Company

Identifying an outstanding company, often described as a "job seeker's holy grail," involves looking for an employer that treats its employees well and is a place where one can envision a long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Promotion from Within

A strong indicator of a great company is its culture of promoting employees internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Asking "Why is the position open?" can reveal if a previous employee was promoted to a more advanced role, signaling a company that encourages and supports internal career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. A high percentage of internal movement indicates that applying oneself can lead to career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Low Turnover Rates

Great companies typically do not experience high turnover, as employees generally do not want to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While difficult for external candidates to ascertain, checking for recent layoffs in press releases can provide clues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Companies that frequently lay off and then rehire are generally not considered great employers, as such knee-jerk reactions create instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Aim to target companies with a turnover rate under the industry standard of approximately 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## [[Understanding pay and benefits expectations | Pay and Compensation Philosophy]]

A critical aspect to [[understanding_compensation_packages_in_salary_negotiation | evaluate]] is the company's philosophy on pay and compensation â€“ whether they are a "pay leader" or a "pay lagger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Pay Leaders vs. Pay Laggers

*   **Pay Laggers:** Some companies strategically decide to offer lower compensation relative to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Pay Leaders:** Other companies aim to be pay leaders to attract the highest caliber candidates and retain employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. An astute job seeker will target these pay leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Researching Compensation

To determine a company's pay philosophy:
*   **Investigative Sleuthing:** Utilize platforms like Glassdoor or LinkedIn to find self-reported salary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For larger companies, sufficient data points should be available to gauge typical compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Compare to Current Earnings:** If a company's reported pay is below your current compensation, they are likely not a pay leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Industry Standards:** Certain industries, like tech, generally pay significantly more than others, such as non-profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It's important to select the right industry and then target leaders within that industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Comprehensive Benefits Packages

Beyond salary, [[assessing_overall_job_offer_value_including_benefits_and_perks | evaluate]] the company's benefits strategy:
*   **Core Benefits:** Look for strong medical, dental, vision, and 401k programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Bonuses:** Assess if bonuses contribute to a competitive overall package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Investment in Benefits:** Great employers continuously invest in and expand their benefits packages over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Companies that consistently cut benefits or pass costs to employees are less desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Soft Indicators of a Great Company

Beyond direct compensation, several "softer" factors contribute to a positive work environment and should be considered when [[evaluating_company_culture_during_interviews | evaluating company culture]].

### Personal Development and Growth

*   **Investment in Employees:** Great companies invest in personal development, offering additional training, opportunities for stretch assignments, and support for attending industry conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Such investment often correlates with low employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Rewards and Recognition

*   **Employee Recognition:** A strong employer has rewards and recognition programs that celebrate accomplishments, milestones, and even personal events like birthdays, weddings, or births <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Family Involvement:** Companies that involve employees' families in celebrations or events like barbecues enhance the overall employment experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Work-Life Balance

*   **Manageable Workloads:** A great company hires adequate staff and provides manageable workloads, valuing employees' time off to recharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Vacation Policies:** Look for companies generous with vacation and paid time off, ideally allowing substantial time off early in one's tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Consistent negative feedback on work-life balance from reviews is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### [[Assessing company strategy and leadership style | Leadership Team Quality]]

*   **Honesty and Transparency:** Trustworthy leaders are honest, transparent, and live by the core values they publish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Leaders who say one thing and do another negatively impact employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Target companies where senior leadership has a strong, trustworthy reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Overall Employee Morale

*   **Positive Atmosphere:** While challenging to gauge during an interview, look for signs of high employee morale. Pay close attention to online reviews on sites like Glassdoor, Indeed, or Comparably, and read feedback on leadership and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. If visiting on-site, observe if employees seem to enjoy their work and interactions, indicating a positive culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. High morale suggests a desirable workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

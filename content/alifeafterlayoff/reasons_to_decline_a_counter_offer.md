While receiving a counter offer from your current employer might feel validating, it's often advisable to [[risks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | think twice about accepting one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Experience shows that in many circumstances, accepting a counter offer doesn't work out well in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Why Your Current Employer Offers a Counter Offer

Often, a counter offer emerges only after you've tendered your resignation, signaling that the company can't "live without you" now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This often indicates:

*   **Underpayment or Lack of Recognition** Your current employer likely took you for granted or underpaid you to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. If the market rate is 30% higher, it strongly suggests you were not valued appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The question becomes, "Why wasn't I recognized before?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Caught Off Guard** They might have been caught off guard and didn't think you would ever leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The counter offer could be a tactic to "buy some time" while they get their "ducks in a row" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Systematic Problem** A high-level response to your resignation (e.g., meeting with COOs, Presidents) might indicate a systemic problem within the company that they're trying to address reactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Reasons to Decline a Counter Offer

There are several compelling [[factors_influencing_decision_to_accept_a_counteroffer | factors influencing the decision to accept a counteroffer]], and many point towards declining.

### The "Dangling Carrot" of Future Promises
Companies often dangle the "proverbial carrot" of future plans and opportunities once you resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This is a common trap where people stay in jobs too long based on a "promise of something that's going to be just out of reach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   **Slow to Materialize**: Even if intentions are genuine, "talk is cheap," and plans, especially with some companies, "become the fruition slowly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Concrete Plan**: If they promise leadership roles, they should already have a clear career plan or succession planning program in place, with development opportunities and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. If you weren't part of such a program before, it's a big indicator that these aspirations are not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Not About Your Growth**: Often, the company's perspective is "we can use you," rather than genuinely supporting your career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Becoming a "Target" or "Flight Risk"
Accepting a counter offer can put a "target on your back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **Increased Scrutiny**: You become a more expensive version of yourself, and there will be a higher level of expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Any misstep might be met with "yeah, we're paying him more now and he can't even do XYZ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Layoff Vulnerability**: In the event of future layoffs, you might be circled on the list as the "most expensive person in the department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Perceived Disloyalty**: The company may look at you as a "Flight Risk" now because you've demonstrated a willingness to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Insufficient Changes to the Role
A counter offer, especially if it only involves a pay bump without significant changes to your role, might not be enough to justify staying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **Lack of New Challenge**: If you're not being challenged, a pay raise alone won't solve that underlying issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **No New Title or Level**: Unless it comes with a new job title and probably a new level, it might not move the needle for your career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Unclear New Responsibilities**: Any counter offer should include clear, documented new responsibilities, a job description, and a pay grade in writing from the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Trusting Your Gut and Past Behavior
Your gut feeling is usually a great indicator; if it tells you to leave, trust it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

*   **Company's Past Performance**: Just as past performance indicates future performance for an individual, the same applies to a company or boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Consider how they have treated you and others in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Discrepancy in Value**: If they're suddenly willing to offer a significant pay bump, question why you weren't "worth it last week" before you had one foot out the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Navigating Counter Offer Discussions

When faced with a counter offer, remember you are in complete control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

*   **Listen, Don't Disclose**: Hear them out, but keep information about your new opportunity (salary, company, job title) private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Companies have been known to "torpedo you behind the scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Focus on Opportunity, Not Issues**: State that you are leaving not due to an issue with them, but because you were "pulled by an opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Honor Commitments**: It's good to honor the commitment you've made to the new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. While you're not legally obligated to start even after signing an offer letter, you should still do what's best for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Conclusion
While every situation is unique, and there might be rare circumstances where accepting a counter offer is beneficial, it's crucial to trust your gut and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Often, the reasons behind a counter offer and its potential [[longterm_career_impact_of_accepting_counteroffers | long-term career impact]] are not in your best interest. It's important to act as the CEO of your own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Employment ghosting is a common and frustrating experience for job seekers, defined as an employer or company representative failing to follow up on a candidate's application status after moving them into a formalized interviewing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It is considered poor [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Understanding the reasons behind employment ghosting can help organizations implement [[improving_job_offer_processes | strategies for improvement]].

## Common Reasons for Employment Ghosting

Several factors contribute to employers failing to follow up with candidates:

### Lazy Recruiting and Recruiters
Sometimes, recruiters are simply too busy or disorganized to follow up with candidates, or they may forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This lack of effort or care is considered a bad look for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Bad Work Processes
Companies lacking internal controls or formalized talent acquisition departments often struggle with effective follow-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. When best practices and formalized processes are not implemented, [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Additionally, inadequate technology or software that cannot handle the volume of applicants can contribute to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
Recruiters carrying too many requisitions (over 25, when 15-25 is generally manageable) can lead to a decline in [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. With responsibilities like submitting multiple candidates per job, an overloaded recruiter might be managing 200+ candidates at any given time, making it easy for some to "fall through the cracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness and Delays
A significant cause of perceived ghosting is when [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring managers]] sit on candidate applications for extended periods, or request additional candidates before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This can delay the [[recruitment_strategies_and_candidate_profiles | hiring process]] by weeks, making early candidates feel ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Recruiters often push back on such indecisiveness to ensure timely dispositioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold or Re-scoped
Jobs may be placed on hold or re-scoped mid-process, leading to delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. While the company may want to keep current candidates "lukewarm," this essentially means they are not liked enough to make a decision, which is poor [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Hired Another Candidate Without Proper Follow-up
If another candidate is hired, but the recruiter closes the requisition without updating all other candidates, it's a symptom of poor work processes or bad recruiting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Strategies for Improving Recruitment Processes

Companies can significantly reduce ghosting and enhance their [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] by adopting proactive [[recruitment_strategies_and_candidate_profiles | strategies]]:

### Prioritizing Candidate Experience
Forward-thinking organizations place [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] at the forefront of their employment process, recognizing its impact on their employment brand and even their bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Accountability Metrics
Companies like Amazon hold their recruiters accountable with strict metrics around [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For example, Amazon has a "two and five promise":
*   **Two Days**: After a [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager]] phone screen, candidates receive an update within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Five Days**: After an on-site interview loop, candidates receive feedback within five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
This forces [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring teams]] to be efficient and decisive, and recruiters to push for quick answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Formalized Talent Acquisition Departments
Companies with dedicated talent acquisition departments within HR tend to have better processes and best practices for [[recruitment_strategies_and_candidate_profiles | recruiting]], which improves [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Adequate Technology
Utilizing good technology for applicant tracking systems helps manage the volume of applicants properly, reducing instances of candidates being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Realistic Recruiter Workloads
Ensuring recruiters handle a manageable number of requisitions (around 15-25) prevents them from becoming overloaded and improves their ability to maintain communication with candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Proactive Decision Making
Recruiters should push back on [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring managers]] who are indecisive or delay decisions, advocating for candidates to be dispositioned promptly even if they are not the perfect fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. If a position is closed, all candidates in process should be properly closed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Treating Candidates as Customers
Companies should consider how they would treat candidates if they were also customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Poor [[recruitment_and_employment_experience_trends | candidate experience]] can negatively impact customer perception and the business's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### What Candidates Can Do
If a candidate suspects they have been ghosted, they can send a polite "nudge" to the recruiter to inquire about the status of their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This can prompt the recruiter to provide an update or properly close out the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

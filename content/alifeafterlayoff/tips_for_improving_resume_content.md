As a recruiter and career coach, the presenter frequently reviews resumes and notes that many require significant improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article provides resume writing tips designed to help job seekers present their best foot forward and increase their chances of landing job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## General Philosophy for Resume Writing

There is no single "right" way to write a resume, and many approaches are valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The ultimate test of a resume's effectiveness is whether it achieves the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The tips shared here come from a [[recruiter_perspective_on_resume_writing | corporate recruiter perspective]], focusing on how recruiters quickly screen resumes (often a 5-second glance) and feedback from hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The goal is to capture attention quickly and secure a first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Resume Design and Format

### Avoid Outdated Templates
Many templates, particularly those found on sites like Canva.com or industry resume hubs, incorporate graphics, charts, and "cute" presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. These designs are generally a bad idea because they distract from the primary purpose: quickly finding essential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Instead, it's recommended to use a very simple template, such as those available on Microsoft Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
When choosing a template:
*   Opt for a one-column layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Avoid bright and flashy colors and graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Ensure fonts are clean and easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Stick to basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   For most professions, a resume should be "relatively boring" in its design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

*Exception*: If you are a graphic designer or in a creative field, a more creative approach might be expected and appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, even then, avoid templates designed by other graphic designers as they may not be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### ATS Compliance
Many graphic designer templates are ineffective because they are not designed with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

*   **Contact Information**: Avoid horizontal contact information layouts; instead, use a vertical format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. ATS systems typically struggle to read and parse horizontal information correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. If you frequently need to manually enter your name, phone number, or address when applying for jobs, your resume might not be ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Content Strategy for Impact

### Profile for Specific Roles, Don't Just Summarize
Instead of writing a resume as a summary of every career accomplishment, focus on profiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The goal is to deliver exactly what the employer is looking for for a specific role, rather than hoping they find something they like within a broad summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Concentrate on what hiring teams genuinely care about, not irrelevant past accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### [[customizing_resumes_for_specific_roles | Customize Resumes]]
[[customizing_resumes_for_specific_roles | Customizing resumes]] is crucial in today's job market, especially for competitive remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. While it might seem uncomfortable, it's a necessary habit to develop to stand out from the fierce competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Since many applicants neglect [[customizing_resumes_for_specific_roles | customization]], doing so provides a significant competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Be Concise and Clear
Avoid wordy resumes that are blocks of text, as they can cause eyes to glaze over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers will likely skip resumes with massive text blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Be concise, selective with words, and focus on how the text is laid out on the page for easy scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Eliminate Proprietary Language
Remove proprietary language such as project names, division names, or product types that are only known by your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Boil down concepts into clear, common language understood within the industry you are applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Remove Generic Fluffy Terminology
Generic terms like "team player" or "great organizational skills" often make recruiters roll their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. If these are important competencies, they will be assessed during an interview, and a resume isn't the best place to demonstrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Instead, focus on more actionable terms and concepts related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear and concise fit for the job to secure an interview, not to impress with elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Iterative Improvement and Realism

### Be Adaptable
If your resume isn't yielding results, be willing to redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Continuing the same approach while expecting different results is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Repeated rejections at the application level suggest your resume isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Realistic Job Fit
Be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Carefully review the job posting to ensure you truly stack up against the requirements, especially when facing hundreds or thousands of other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Your resume must clearly convey your fit to maximize your chances of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Remember to "plan, do, check, and adjust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. If results are not met, make changes and try different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Many individuals learn the hard way that traditional hard work does not automatically lead to promotions or career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## The Misconception of Hard Work

The belief that paying dues, putting in long hours, and doing "necessary" hard work will lead to advancement often results in a "dangling carrot" that is continually pushed further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Employees may feel pressure to work excessive hours, especially if they have an [[impact_of_a_workaholic_boss_on_employees | workaholic boss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. However, this dedication does not guarantee a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. For example, working 12+ hours a day, sometimes including Saturdays, to impress a boss might not lead to a promotion, especially if the department or plan ultimately shuts down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Working Smart vs. Working Hard

The key to career advancement is not working the *most* hours, but working the *smartest* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
Working smartly involves:
*   **Focusing on Visible Projects** Working on projects that your boss and your boss's boss care about is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. If your efforts are on tasks they don't value, your name may not be mentioned for promotions in the way you hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Highly Visible Projects** Promotions are often linked to highly visible projects and ensuring that the right people know about your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Self-Advocacy and Visibility

A common mistake is not advocating for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. To get promoted, you must understand the rules of the game and actively participate, rather than watching promotions go to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This means advocating for yourself to the right people, who are often not just your immediate boss, but your boss's boss, as they are often the ones making promotion decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

You must be your own advocate in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. To be the "CEO of your career," you need to act as your own marketing department, creating campaigns to highlight your effectiveness within the company and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This proactive approach is essential for those interested in moving up within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

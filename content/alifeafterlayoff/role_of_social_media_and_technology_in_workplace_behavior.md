The rise of social media and ubiquitous personal technology has significantly impacted workplace behavior, particularly among recent graduates entering the workforce. Employers are increasingly observing a disconnect in professionalism and focus, often attributing these issues to the pervasive use of digital devices and social platforms.

## Employer Expectations vs. Gen Z Habits

A survey of 966 business leaders involved in hiring decisions revealed that 75% of companies reported at least some issue with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Among the frequently cited reasons for these new hires not working out, a lack of professionalism (nearly 46%) and challenges with feedback were prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Despite growing up with iPads and iPhones, a surprising 28% of employers reported that recent college graduates lack technological skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This points to a potential gap between general tech familiarity and the specific technical skills required in a professional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Key Concerns Related to Technology Use:

*   **Distraction and Focus:** Many employers note that young employees struggle to put down their phones and focus on work for more than 10 minutes, which is seen as a symptom of the "constant swiping" and "dopamine hit" associated with social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Unprofessionalism:**
    *   One in five employers stated that recent graduates are often unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   19% observed that they often don't use appropriate language at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   A common complaint is the inability to separate from phones, with some employees constantly scrolling TikTok at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Case Study: The Nurse Grad
> A brand new nurse graduate working in a busy emergency department was observed not staying off her phone, ignoring assignments and patients, and even texting friends about patients. When her phone was taken away, she had a "tantrum" and ultimately chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This incident led the department to stop hiring new nurse grads, negatively impacting others who genuinely seek a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Social Media and Employment

[[social_medias_impact_on_career | Social media]] is increasingly becoming a factor in hiring and employment decisions. Employers actively check candidates' social media presence before hiring to assess [[managing_workplace_relationships | culture fit]] within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

There is a perceived lack of separation between personal and professional lives among younger generations on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Employees posting everything on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, including instances of "slacking off at work" and bragging about it, can lead to negative impressions from employers and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Employer Demands for Professionalism

Hiring managers are providing clear feedback on what they expect from new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>:
*   Initiative and positive attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
*   Strong work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   Adaptability and openness to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   Punctuality and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Solid technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   Professional [[social_medias_impact_on_career | social media]] conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   Avoiding political topics at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>

> [!INFO] Manager's Perspective
> An owner of a construction company in Southern California stated that young people today often lack communication skills, critical thinking, motivation, and require constant supervision. They also noted a "zero attention to detail" and frustration with tasks requiring persistence, along with a refusal to separate themselves from their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

The trend suggests that employers are becoming less tolerant of what they perceive as a "cultural mismatch" and are quick to terminate employees who do not meet expected [[handling_workplace_professionalism | professionalism]] standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This includes behaviors like lateness, unprofessional attire, inappropriate language, and not managing workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

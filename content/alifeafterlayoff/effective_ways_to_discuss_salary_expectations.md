Navigating the interview process can be challenging, and one of the critical areas to manage effectively is the discussion around salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Knowing how and when to address this topic can significantly impact your impression on potential employers and prevent you from ending up in the "no pile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## When NOT to Bring Up Salary

As a job candidate, it is crucial to avoid initiating the conversation about salary too early in the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **Avoid asking immediately** Asking about salary right at the beginning of an interview is a "big turn off" for employers, as you haven't even learned what the position entails yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. While employers don't want to waste your time, letting the recruiter or interviewer bring up the topic first is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This prevents the employer from questioning your primary motivation for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Do not ask hiring managers about pay ranges** If you've advanced past the initial recruiting stage, the salary topic has likely already been covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Asking the hiring manager about pay ranges is an "even bigger turn off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This is because the HR department, talent acquisition team, and hiring manager typically collaborate to determine a fair offer, and the hiring manager rarely has the final say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Such a question might suggest you are "fishing for a better answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## When the Recruiter Brings It Up

The recruiter will typically be the one to bring up the question of salary expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

*   **Know your number** You should have a specific salary figure in mind that you need to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Avoid delaying the discussion** Attempting to avoid the question or push the discussion further into the process will likely result in you not passing that interview round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

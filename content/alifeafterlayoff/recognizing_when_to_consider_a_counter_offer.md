While the general advice is often to [[why_you_should_not_accept_a_counteroffer | not accept a counter offer]] from your current employer, there are specific circumstances where it might be in your best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. As a career coach, the primary concern is your best interest, and many experiences show that [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | accepting a counter]] doesn't always work out well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Case Study: A Reddit Scenario

A real-life scenario from Reddit illustrates key points about [[understanding_counteroffers_from_employers | counter offers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. An individual accepted a job offer with a non-competing company, offering a 30% pay bump for similar work with expanded responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This significant increase suggests the individual was either underpaid or had stayed in their role too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The new role offered career progression by expanding responsibilities, which is beneficial for a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

Upon tendering their [[strategies_for_job_resignation_and_counter_offers | resignation]], the current employer suddenly surfaced "big plans" for the employee, asking "what can we do to keep you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This sudden revelation of plans, like hiring new people to report to the employee, often occurs only after a resignation is submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This is a common "proverbial carrot" dangled to prevent employees from leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Navigating the Conversation

When faced with a counter offer, you are in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The approach to [[how_to_navigate_job_offers_and_counter_offers | navigate]] these conversations includes:
*   **Keep details confidential:** Do not disclose information about the new opportunity, including salary, company, or job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This prevents the current employer from potentially sabotaging your new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Hear them out:** Allow your current employer to present their offer without revealing your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **State your intention:** Clearly communicate that your departure is due to an opportunity, not an issue with the current company, and that you intend to honor your commitment to the new offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Trust your gut:** Your intuition is a strong indicator of the best course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Act as CEO of your career:** Always prioritize your own best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

### Red Flags in Counter Offers

Several [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_offers | red flags]] indicate that a counter offer might not be genuine or beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>:

*   **Lack of prior recognition:** If your value or potential is only recognized after you've tendered your resignation, it suggests you were taken for granted or underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
*   **Vague or undocumented promises:** Any "big plans" or new roles should be in writing, accompanied by a solid pay bump, a new job title and level, a detailed job description, and an official offer letter from HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Without a new job title and level, you might just become a "more expensive version of the same" employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   **Unprepared response:** Companies caught off guard by your resignation may offer a counter just to buy time, not out of genuine commitment to your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on company needs:** If the counter is framed as "we can use you" rather than "we would like to help you grow your career," it indicates a lack of concern for your career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.
*   **Slow career advancement:** If you know the company's "wheel turns slowly" or promotions typically only happen when someone dies or retires, promises of quick advancement are likely hollow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.
*   **No formal succession plan:** For leadership or executive roles, respectable companies have succession planning programs with targeted development, mentoring, and training. If you're not already part of such a program, sudden promises of high-level positions are questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

### Risks of Accepting a Counter Offer

[[effects_of_accepting_a_counter_offer_on_career_prospects | Accepting a counter]] offer can lead to several risks:
*   **Target on your back:** You become a more expensive employee, potentially making you a prime candidate for layoffs in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. There will also be higher expectations for your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **Flight risk perception:** The company may view you as a Flight Risk, impacting future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Unhappy new employer:** If you renege on an accepted offer, the new employer will be disappointed, though it's important to remember you have no obligation to start a new job even after signing an offer letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

### When to Potentially Consider a Counter Offer

While rare, a counter offer might be worth considering if:
*   **It unlocks an entirely new vertical:** The offer comes with a new job title, new level, new responsibilities, and a clear job description that genuinely expands your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **The offer is fully documented:** All promises, including pay range and responsibilities, are in writing from the Human Resources department via an official offer letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.
*   **Past behavior supports future promises:** Consider how your current company has treated you and others in the past. Past performance is the best indicator of future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. If they have a strong track record of promoting internally and supporting career growth, it might be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.
*   **Your gut tells you so:** Ultimately, if the counter offer feels right and addresses your core reasons for seeking new opportunities, trust your intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>.

Even if you decline a counter offer, it's wise to "never burn a bridge" and maintain professional connections. You can suggest staying in touch for future, genuinely enhanced leadership roles, explicitly stating you'd expect your seniority to be honored if you were to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This strategy reveals how serious they truly are about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

Have you heard of quiet quitting? What if a company tries to do something similar to you, in the form of quiet firing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> This article will outline some signs that your employer may be getting ready to push you out of the company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>

## What is Quiet Firing?

In human resources, there's a concept called **constructive dismissal** (or constructive discharge). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> This occurs when a company intentionally makes your work or employment situation so unbearable that you feel you have no choice but to quit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

Companies may engage in quiet firing for various reasons:
*   They might consider you a potential "problem" and fear that a direct termination could cause additional issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   They may want to avoid paying out certain benefits, such as unemployment insurance, because if you leave voluntarily, they are not obligated to pay it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

## Signs You're Being Quiet Fired

If you're starting to get an uneasy feeling that your days at a company might be numbered, here are some [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags]] to watch for that indicate your company may have ill intentions regarding your employment: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

### 1. No Raise in Several Years
This is a significant sign, especially if you know that other people in your department or company have received raises, but you haven't. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> If the company has decided to cut you off from future raises while others are getting them, it's a strong indicator that you should update your resume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>

### 2. Repeatedly Passed Up for Promotion
If you've made it known that you're interested in a promotion and have positioned yourself as the best fit, but it never materializes, or you're consistently skipped over by less deserving individuals, pay attention. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> When a company decides to promote someone else over you, there's often a discussion behind the scenes about the potential fallout. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> If you're continually blocked, it's best to act like a "free agent" and update your resume, network, and re-enter the job market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>

### 3. PTO/Vacation Requests Denied
If your paid time off (PTO) or vacation requests are repeatedly denied, assuming you're not abusing the time and have coordinated with colleagues for coverage, it indicates that your employer may not value you and wants to make your life uncomfortable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

### 4. Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
Being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or similar performance management tool often means the company is beginning to manage you out of the business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> While not every PIP automatically leads to exit, if the plan seems unreasonable or not based in reality, it's likely an attempt to encourage you to leave voluntarily. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

### 5. Schedule is Being Manipulated
*   **Mandatory Overtime:** If you suddenly have a lot of mandatory overtime, especially during times your boss knows you're unavailable or it would be a particular burden, it's a sign they might be managing you out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   **Hours Cut:** Conversely, your hours could be cut to the bare minimum required to keep you employed, which could affect your benefits eligibility and paycheck, prompting you to seek a new job. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>

### 6. Workload is Unbearable
The company might dump so much work on you that it becomes unbearable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> Any reasonable person doing double the work with no additional pay and forced hours they don't want to work is likely to look for another job. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> Unscrupulous companies may use this to their advantage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

### 7. Suddenly Lackluster Performance Appraisals
If your performance appraisals suddenly become poor, especially after a history of good reviews, and your boss becomes overly critical of things they used to be complimentary about, this is a red flag. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> HR departments use performance appraisals for formal documentation, and a sudden downturn could be part of a plan to manage you out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>

### 8. Boss is No Longer Communicating
A major warning sign is when your boss stops communicating with you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> This could manifest as:
*   Missing private one-on-one syncs or rescheduling last minute. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   Not responding to emails in a timely manner. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   Always seeming busy or having their door closed to you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
*   Not providing information or helping clear roadblocks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
Your boss could be disengaging from you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>

### 9. Removed from Typical Work/Meetings
If you're suddenly removed from work you were typically involved with, such as a project you were leading being handed off, or you're no longer invited to staff meetings you used to attend, it's a warning sign. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> Additionally, if you're no longer privy to "water cooler talk" or feel shunned in public when your boss is with others, it could indicate a deliberate effort to exclude you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>

## What to Do If You See These Signs

This is not an all-encompassing list, and noticing one or two of these things doesn't automatically mean you're being quiet fired. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> However, you should start paying attention and trust your gut. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

If you find yourself in a situation where you believe the company is constructively discharging you, you have a few options:

*   **Continue Status Quo:** You can continue as is and force the company's hand, allowing them to terminate you if that is their intention. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   **Quit and Find a Better Job:** Embrace the "free agent" approach and [[signs_you_need_to_quit_your_job | quit your job]] to find a more supportive environment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> Staying in a toxic environment is detrimental to your personal life, mental health, and career. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
*   **Seek Legal Counsel:** If you feel you're being discriminated against, consult a local attorney to understand your rights and local laws. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

It's always best practice to keep your resume updated and ready to go, so you don't have to scramble when you need it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>

To maximize your chances of finding opportunities, it is crucial to be active and engaged on LinkedIn. Recruiters extensively use LinkedIn to source and find candidates, often preferring direct searches over open job postings due to the platform's targeted search capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

As a job seeker, avoiding common mistakes can significantly improve your prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Key Strategies for [[Effectively Networking on LinkedIn | Effective LinkedIn Engagement]]

### 1. Allow Contact
Recruiters use a separate platform called LinkedIn Recruiter to search the database from the back end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. A common frustration is finding a perfect candidate only to discover they have blocked contact from anyone they don't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
If you are an active job seeker or want opportunities to come your way, allowing recruiters to contact you about opportunities is essential; otherwise, you might miss out on great options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Even passive candidates should keep their contact options open, as it takes minimal effort to manage unwanted emails, and a single valuable opportunity could arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Receiving many contact attempts from recruiters indicates you are in demand and have a strong profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### 2. Optimize with Keywords
Recruiters utilize advanced search strategies, like Boolean searches, using strings of keywords to find very specific and targeted profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. If your profile does not contain these specific keywords, you will not appear in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
It is advisable to load your [[Importance of Keywords in LinkedIn Profiles | LinkedIn profile]] with keywords that recruiters might be looking for, tailored to your industry and the types of positions available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Keeping a pulse on your industry to identify major skills and adding them to your profile will increase your visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### 3. Be Active on the Platform
Beyond having a well-optimized profile, being active on LinkedIn is crucial. If you are not regularly checking your messages, recruiters cannot effectively reach you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
Consider setting up email notifications for direct messages if you don't check LinkedIn daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Adjust your settings to receive only necessary notifications to avoid overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Staying active also allows you to see job opportunities and industry news posted in your feed by your network and other recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This passive discovery can lead to unexpected opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### 4. Build Your Network
Having a robust network is vital. Profiles with fewer than 100 connections often indicate a less active and engaged user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. There is no practical limit to the number of connections you can have on LinkedIn (currently around 35,000 to 50,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
The more people you are connected with, the more opportunities you have to brand yourself and receive new prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Start by connecting with former employers, colleagues, and bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Then, expand to local industry professionals in similar roles and companies to build direct opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Aim for a minimum of 500+ connections, which makes your profile appear more active and invested in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### 5. Engage, Don't Just Lurk
Simply having connections isn't enough; you must engage with content and create your own. If you never engage or post, your name and [[linkedin_profile_strategy_and_headshot_importance | brand]] won't be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
Engaging by leaving thoughtful comments and creating valuable content builds your employment brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Recruiters, who are on LinkedIn daily, notice active engagement and can identify individuals who are experts or highly engaged within their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Even if you're not comfortable creating content, start by engaging on one post a day, or try posting two to three times a week, or even just once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### 6. Avoid Controversial Discussions
When engaging to build your employment brand, it is crucial to avoid controversial discussions, especially political, religious, or non-work-related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
Arguments on LinkedIn can be seen by thousands of people in your network and beyond, potentially associating your brand with negative interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. While having independent opinions is fine, LinkedIn is not the appropriate platform for getting into public arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Always keep your interactions work-related, professional, and above the cuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Recruiters may judge your professional demeanor based on your online conduct, regardless of whether they agree with your views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

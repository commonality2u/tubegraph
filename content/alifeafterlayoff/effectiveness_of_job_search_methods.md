A corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience in interviewing and hiring thousands of people for large companies shares a subjective ranking of 15 different ways to look for a job, from least to most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The ranking prioritizes getting a job as quickly as possible while spending the least amount of time, aiming for the biggest "bang for your buck" or return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Methods are scored from 1 (least effective) to 10 (most effective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Some methods may favor blue-collar workers over white-collar, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Ranking of Job Search Methods

### 1/10 - Least Effective

*   **Cold Calling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
    *   Involves soliciting a job without knowing if there's an open position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   Examples include calling a switchboard for HR, dropping in unannounced, or sending an unsolicited note on LinkedIn asking for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   This method "almost never works" from a corporate recruiter's perspective, and the energy spent is not a good use of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Social Media Engagement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
    *   Engaging with a company's Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, or LinkedIn accounts hoping to get noticed by a hiring team is very unlikely to lead to an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   HR and talent acquisition teams typically do not manage or check social media; it's usually handled by marketing departments, especially in larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   A recruiter is "likely never going to see" engagement on product posts, as it's akin to cold calling with very slim chances of a job fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### 2/10 - Limited Effectiveness

*   **Job Fairs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    *   Can be found through local unemployment centers or universities and are sometimes tailored to specific job types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   Can be effective, especially for blue-collar roles or entry-level university students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   From an employer's perspective, finding highly qualified candidates is "pretty slim," often yielding only one or two exciting resumes from an entire day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Candidates face stiff competition, and it's an untargeted "window shopping" approach for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### 3/10 - Somewhat Inefficient

*   **Industry Events / In-Person Networking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
    *   Involves mingling at networking mixers with people in your industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   Generally an "untargeted way to look for a job" due to awkward small talk and slim chances of finding an immediate job fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   Can be useful for making long-term contacts or if the mixer is highly targeted with hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   May be difficult for introverts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Online Forums** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>
    *   Includes platforms like Reddit, tech forums, or LinkedIn groups for industry networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   Not very targeted for recruiting; posting job interest can lead to a "feeding frenzy" of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   Recruiters may source from these forums for niche roles or candidates with demonstrated expertise, so engaging in the community can make you discoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   Building a knowledge repository for impress potential employers is not bad but "probably not the best use of time" if seeking a quick job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### 4/10 - Moderate Effectiveness

*   **Professional Associations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
    *   Relevant for industries with large professional associations, like SHRM for Human Resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Participating in local chapters surrounds you with highly focused professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   Getting involved in committees or becoming known as an expert can be a decent way to brand yourself, especially in a local labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   More geared towards white-collar than blue-collar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### 5/10 - Average Effectiveness

*   **Company Website Direct Application** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
    *   Applying directly on a company's website bypasses external job boards and feeds directly into their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Your resume is more likely to be seen by a recruiter compared to some external job board applications that might not automatically filter into the ATS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   It's worth applying directly if you find a job on a job board that interests you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Headhunter / Agency / Job House** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>
    *   These are third parties contracted by employers to fill positions, often working with multiple employers and roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   While they might have other jobs if you don't fit the primary role, relationships with headhunters often "fizzle pretty quickly" after initial consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Using an agency is fine as it doesn't cost the job seeker anything, but it shouldn't be the sole focus of your [[job_search_strategies | job search strategies]]; you must take ownership of your career and do most of the activities yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Simple Website / Blog** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>
    *   Creating a website or blog to brand yourself as an expert and upload a portfolio of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   "Especially powerful" and often necessary for design, graphic design, motion, photography, or any creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   Blog sites can be very beneficial for writing content about niche work, potentially leading companies to "come knocking on your door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
    *   Takes more effort to set up and does not provide "immediate results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### 6/10 - Good, but Competitive

*   **Job Boards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>
    *   The most common method, involving applying to active job postings on platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   The primary challenge is competing with many other applicants without knowing your standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
    *   Employers use various other methods to source candidates, making the candidate pool larger than just those applying through boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
    *   Recruiters may receive few candidates for some jobs, allowing good candidates to be seen quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    *   However, the chances of a candidate being a good fit for a role when thousands apply are "pretty small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
    *   Only 5-10% of jobs are filled through active job postings because applicants are often not well-aligned with requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
    *   Despite the effort and potential unfairness, it's still "worth doing" because only one offer is needed for re-employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   For more information on the [[effectiveness_of_job_application_strategies | effectiveness of job application strategies]] through job boards, refer to videos on interviewing and job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

### 7/10 - Effective Strategies

*   **Online Networking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
    *   Less intimidating than in-person networking, typically done on sites like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
    *   Requires proper etiquette; simply blasting connection requests or unsolicited InMails is like cold calling and won't yield good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   Targeted online networking is one of the more powerful [[strategies_to_improve_job_search_outcomes | strategies to improve job search outcomes]] if done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Responding to Advertisements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>
    *   Distinct from job boards, this refers to "help wanted" signs on billboards, trucks, or storefronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   Offers a decent return rate for the effort spent, provided you are a "decent fit" for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

    *   Gives a "leg up on the competition" and provides a "foot in the door" with the organization, building goodwill and familiarizing you with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

### 8/10 - Highly Effective

*   **Industry Contacts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>

*   **Employee Referrals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>
    *   One of the "really powerful" ways to look for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
    *   If you know someone working at a company you're interested in, reach out for a referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

The concept of contracting versus full-time work is often considered by individuals in a job search, especially when permanent positions are scarce. While there is a stigma associated with contract work, viewing it as lower quality or temporary, it can offer significant advantages depending on personal circumstances and career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Pros of Contracting

### Readily Available Positions
Contract positions are often more numerous, especially during uncertain economic times, as companies may be apprehensive about adding permanent headcount but still need work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This means a higher likelihood of being considered for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Opportunity to Demonstrate Skills and Pivot Career
Contract roles provide a chance for individuals to prove their capabilities to an employer, reducing risk for the hiring company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This can be particularly useful if an employer views a candidate as a "stretch" for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Many contract positions can convert to full-time if the individual performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Contracts can also facilitate pivoting into a new industry, job type, or gaining new skills, enhancing one's resume with relevant experience in a desired field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Financial and Lifestyle Benefits
One of the primary benefits of contracting is the ability to maintain income while continuing a job search for a full-time position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This can bridge the gap during long job searches, which can often take six to nine months, or even up to a year, especially given that unemployment benefits typically run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Contracting also allows individuals to "test drive" a company or work environment. If the work, environment, or colleagues are not a good fit, it's easier to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

For those who have experienced a layoff, a contract position can help boost confidence, provide a routine, and make the subsequent job search easier by offering a steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Financially, contract positions can sometimes offer a higher hourly rate compared to full-time roles, potentially leading to a significant annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Some individuals leverage this to take extended breaks between contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Cons of Contracting

### [[Impact of contracting on career perception and resume | Impact on Career Perception and Resume]]
A significant drawback is the risk of developing a "hopping resume" if one takes too many contract positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Hiring managers often view resumes with frequent short-term engagements negatively, perceiving a lack of commitment to long-term projects or an inability to build lasting relationships within a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This [[recruiters_perspective_on_contract_positions | recruiter's perspective]] can be a hurdle when seeking full-time roles later in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Lack of Benefits and Security
In most cases, contract positions do not offer benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, or paid time off, which are typically standard for full-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. While some agencies might offer benefits, they are generally not as comprehensive as corporate packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Contract work can create a sense of limbo, as individuals must continuously plan for what's next after the contract ends, especially if it doesn't convert to full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This instability can impact major life events, such as buying a house or having children, which often require a stable, consistent income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Employer Commitment and Team Integration
Contractors often know that the employer is not fully committed to them, with no inherent career opportunities beyond the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This can lead to a feeling of not belonging to the team, as discussions about future projects or long-term goals might not include them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Conclusion
Deciding between contract and full-time work requires weighing the [[pros_and_cons_of_contracting_versus_fulltime_work | pros and cons]] based on personal preferences, the current job market, and the urgency of securing income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. For many, contracting can be a strategic move, particularly in challenging job markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

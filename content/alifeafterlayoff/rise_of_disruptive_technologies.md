Disruptive technologies, particularly [[role_of_emerging_technologies_and_ai_in_the_tech_job_market|AI]], are profoundly impacting the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While disruptive technologies have existed throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, [[Impact of artificial intelligence on employment|artificial intelligence]] is considered an unprecedented force in the workforce conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

[[Impact of artificial intelligence on employment|Artificial intelligence]] has the potential to displace millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This represents another dynamic that allows employers to further detach loyalty from employees, as they may not need staff in the same way they used to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The traditional concept of career and employer-employee loyalty is considered dead due to these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The way individuals approach work is drastically changing and evolving at an increasing pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

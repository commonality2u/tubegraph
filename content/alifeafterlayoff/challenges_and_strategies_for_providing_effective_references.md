When looking for a job, applicants may be asked to provide references as part of the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a>. Recruiters and human resources professionals utilize reference checks to gain insight into a candidate's past performance and suitability for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>.

## The Role of References in Hiring

Companies, especially smaller ones or agencies submitting candidates to larger corporations, often require and follow through on reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03"></a>. During these checks, recruiters typically contact the provided references and ask a series of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15"></a>. These questions often focus on the candidate's job performance, work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21"></a>, attendance (particularly for hourly positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24"></a>, strengths, weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32"></a>, and eligibility for rehire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36"></a>.

From a recruiter's perspective, tracking down references and getting them to return calls can be challenging and may delay the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53"></a>.

[[the_role_of_references_in_the_hiring_process | The role of references in the hiring process]] primarily serves as a final verification step, rather than a heavily weighted decision factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32"></a>. If a manager confirms good performance, it's usually sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36"></a>. Reaching the reference check stage often indicates that a job offer is likely forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47"></a>.

## Liability Concerns for Companies

Many companies, especially larger corporations, are increasingly reluctant to provide detailed references due to [[liability_concerns_associated_with_giving_references | liability concerns associated with giving references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02"></a>. If a previous employer gives a negative reference that prevents a candidate from getting a job, they could face legal action for slander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50"></a>.

Human Resources professionals are tasked with limiting a company's exposure to such liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11"></a>. This policy extends to feedback during interview processes, which is often kept generic to avoid legal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17"></a>.

Therefore, large corporations generally do not provide references beyond basic employment verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37"></a>. Employees, especially those with direct reports, are often instructed to direct all reference requests to the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47"></a>.

When HR departments in large corporations receive reference calls, they typically only confirm:
*   The applicant's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04"></a>
*   Dates of employment (start and end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36"></a>
*   Job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34"></a>

They usually do not provide information on compensation, rehire eligibility, or the reason for termination, as this could open the company to further liability if it leads to an adverse hiring decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46"></a>.

## Strategies for Providing Effective References

When asked for references, it's crucial to take the request seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19"></a>. Here are [[best_practices_for_selecting_and_notifying_references | best practices for selecting and notifying references]]:

### 1. Select Legitimate and Relevant References
*   **Direct Managers**: Aim for at least one direct manager, as their feedback is considered the most valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00"></a>.
*   **Customers or Higher-Level Colleagues**: If you can't provide multiple managers, choose someone you directly supported (internal or external customer) or someone a level or two above you who can speak to your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28"></a>. Avoid using peers who do the same job, as their reference may not be as strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19"></a>.

### 2. Ensure a Positive Recommendation
*   Only provide references from individuals who you are confident will give you a good recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11"></a>.
*   A negative reference can complicate the hiring decision for the potential employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00"></a>. Trust your knowledge of who you have good working relationships with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19"></a>.

### 3. Obtain Permission and Notify References
*   Always contact potential references beforehand to ask for their permission to list them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29"></a>.
*   Inform them that you are interviewing and that they might receive a call, and confirm their willingness to take the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38"></a>.
*   Notifying your references helps avoid delays in the hiring process, as they will be expecting the call and won't mistake it for spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12"></a>.

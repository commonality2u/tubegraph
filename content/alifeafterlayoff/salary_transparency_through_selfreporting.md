From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

[[salary_disclosure_in_the_workplace | Salary transparency]], particularly through self-reported data, offers insights into potential earnings across various professions. While data gathered from platforms like Reddit, described as the "wild west of the internet," should be taken with a "grain of salt" due to its self-reported nature, efforts are made to filter for legitimacy and geographic relevance (e.g., North America, specifically the United States) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This approach aims to help individuals determine potential career paths and evaluate what others earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Benefits of Salary Transparency

Promoting [[corporate_transparency_and_trust_issues | transparency]] and [[salary_disclosure_in_the_workplace | equality]] in compensation, some platforms now require job postings to include [[importance_of_clear_job_descriptions_and_competitive_wages | salary ranges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Access to self-reported salaries can serve as inspiration or indicate if one is feeling underpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Activities like playing Xbox, watching TV, taking naps, or reading books are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

This path can be an alternative to traditional college degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

A base rate translates to approximately $90,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It is considered a "high skilled" and "very technical" position due to the catastrophic consequences of errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

    *   **Observation:** This is a very accurate figure based on industry experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Challenges include a limited number of jobs and significant time spent away from home, working specific territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

    *   **Salary:** $95,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** Anecdotal evidence suggests high earnings in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The job may be evolving due to automation, with robotic arms replacing human loaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Sales Roles

*   **Software Sales**
    *   **Salary:** $110,000 base with approximately $110,000 in bonuses, totaling around $210,000 in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** Commissions in software sales, especially in Software as a Service (SaaS), can be "through the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Total compensation between $210,000 and $220,000 is "certainly well within reason" for many software roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

    *   **Salary:** $30,000 to $120,000 per year, depending on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** The market currently sees cars selling themselves due to shortages, which is beneficial for salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, income can fluctuate greatly, requiring a "strong stomach" and good saving habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Google Ad Sales**

    *   **Observation:** This figure is described as "insanely high" and prompts a reevaluation of career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. While confirmation of such high self-reported figures is difficult, Google's significant revenue makes it somewhat believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Healthcare and Emergency Services

*   **Dental Assistant**
    *   **Salary:** $30 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** This figure appears accurate for many areas, translating to $62,500 annually before overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. With overtime, total compensation could reach $70,000 to $75,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The role does not require dental school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Travel Nurse**
    *   **Salary:** $5,100 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** This profession has "absolutely exploded," with demand not anticipated to decrease soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Weekly earnings translate to approximately $229,000 to $230,000 annually if maintained for 45 weeks a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Assignments are typically 13 weeks, with nurses choosing locations and work schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It is a high-stress, high-burnout, and nomadic lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **9-1-1 Operator**
    *   **Salary:** $28 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** This wage is considered "pretty reasonable" for a "high-stress job" that is not suitable for everyone due to the urgency and encounters involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

### Tech and Creative Roles

*   **Software Engineer**
    *   **Salary:** $133,000 per year, excluding bonuses or discounted stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** This base salary is considered "pretty low" for a seasoned software engineer, with expectations of $150,000 to $170,000 at a reasonably sized company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Total compensation (total comp) can be significantly higher with stock incentives and bonuses, which might explain a lower base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Professional Video Game Bug Tester and Finder**
    *   **Salary:** Reportedly made around $360,000 last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Paid based on the amount and size of bugs found, with large bugs potentially earning $2,000 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** This is seen as an "insane" amount of money for playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Animator (Video Games)**
    *   **Salary:** $28 per hour, with 16 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** This rate appears less lucrative than video game debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Unique and Less Traditional Roles

*   **Dog Walker, Pet Sitter, and Gal Friday**
    *   **Salary:** $25 to $50 per hour, averaging $75,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   **Lifestyle:** The job is described as low-stress, allowing for wearing casual clothing, listening to AirPods, and having free time for appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. No benefits are provided, requiring the individual to cover these from their own profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Starting one's own business in this field, rather than working for someone else, can be highly lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. It's suggested as a side hustle that could transition to full-time income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Museum Security Guard**
    *   **Salary:** $29.50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** This wage is surprisingly high for the role, which is not imagined to be high-stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **United States Postal Service (USPS) Package Handler**
    *   **Salary:** $34.23 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Excellent benefits including healthcare, a pension (unheard of in many modern jobs), and six weeks of paid vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. The vacation time and wage suggest long tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Financial and Corporate Roles

*   **Options Investor/Trader**
    *   **Salary:** $125,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** While this figure might seem substantial, it's considered unimpressive among fellow traders, where the "sky's the limit" for earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. However, the risk of losing money quickly is also high if one is inexperienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Corporate Development**
    *   **Salary:** $350,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** The exact nature of this role is unclear, but such a high salary would indicate at least a director or high-level senior director position, possibly in business development or human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Public Service and Other Industries

*   **Minor League Baseball Player**
    *   **Salary:** $2,000 per month for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** The pay is described as "stinks," with no guarantee of advancing to the major leagues; the percentage of players who make it is "astronomically small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. It's advised to have a "plan B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Social Worker**
    *   **Salary:** $46,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
    *   **Observation:** It's suggested that social work should be pursued out of "love," "calling," or "passion," rather than for financial gain, as not-for-profit and social work industries typically do not pay as much as sectors like software development or tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Supplementing income with side hustles might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This figure is consistent with available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

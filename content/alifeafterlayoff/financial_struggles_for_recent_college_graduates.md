Recent college graduates are facing significant [[challenges_faced_by_recent_college_graduates_in_the_workplace | challenges]] as they enter the workforce, particularly concerning financial stability and [[worklife_balance_challenges_for_new_graduates | work-life balance]]. A viral TikTok video highlighted these issues through the experience of one new graduate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Reality of the 9-to-5
The transition from college life, which often involves less true responsibility beyond academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, to a full-time 9-to-5 job can be jarring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Many new graduates, particularly [[challenges_faced_by_gen_z_in_the_job_market | Gen Z]], are finding that the "9-to-5 grind" represents the rest of their adult life, which can be upsetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. There is a significant disconnect between expectations and the reality of a career that extends beyond just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Commute and Lack of Personal Time
The new graduate in the viral video described her first in-person 9-to-5 job after college as highly demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Her commute alone took a substantial portion of her day, with her leaving at 7:30 AM and not returning home until 6:15 PM at the earliest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This schedule left her with no time or energy for essential personal activities like cooking, showering, or working out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. She also questioned how people manage friendships and dating with such a restrictive schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*Remote work* is seen as an attractive alternative due to the elimination of commute time, allowing individuals to be home immediately after work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, even remote workers often find themselves working longer hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Impact of Job Loss
Compounding these initial struggles, the graduate who posted the viral TikTok was subsequently laid off from her first post-college job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This brought an additional layer of financial reality, as she was early in her career with limited experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. She had moved to New York City for the job, which took her five months to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The layoff occurred before the holidays, a period when hiring processes typically slow down until mid-to-late January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Core Financial Challenges
The graduate highlighted several critical financial issues:
*   **Low Salaries:** She was not making enough to cover living expenses, even with a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Savings:** She could not build an emergency fund because all her income went towards living costs and commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **High Cost of Living:** Living in a big city like New York, while starting a career, presents extraordinary expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

This situation reflects a broader sentiment that despite having degrees, internships, and portfolios, many new graduates find their efforts "still not enough" to secure financially viable employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Solutions
The financial struggles of new graduates are intertwined with larger economic and societal issues:
*   **[[impact_of_student_debt_on_career_choices | Student Debt]]**: There's a significant concern about the amount of money spent on college versus the salaries earned post-graduation, especially with high interest rates on student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This can make it hard to get ahead financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **[[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | Challenges in the Job Market]]**: The current job market has been volatile, with "up and down" periods and "pendulum swinging back and forth," making it a difficult environment for [[challenges_in_todays_job_market | Generation Z]] entering the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Need for [[strategies_for_financial_stability_during_job_loss | Side Hustles]]**: Given the financial realities, developing passive income streams or "side hustles" is becoming increasingly necessary, especially early in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This can help individuals reclaim control over their finances and avoid being reactive to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Career Planning**: It's crucial for those early in their careers to develop a strategic plan rather than "winging it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This foresight can prevent future difficulties and potentially allow for earlier exits from the traditional workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Despite these [[issues_with_the_current_job_market_and_hiring_practices | challenges]], the incoming generations are expected to bring "interesting changes" to the workplace, potentially revolutionizing how work is approached and finding a better balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

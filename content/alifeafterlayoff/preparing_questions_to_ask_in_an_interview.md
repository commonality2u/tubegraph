Asking questions at the end of an interview is a crucial part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This demonstrates your engagement and helps you gather vital information.

## Strategic Questioning During the Interview
To be particularly effective, aim to get some questions about the job itself answered earlier in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This allows you to leverage that information to your advantage throughout the rest of the [[job_interview_strategies_and_tips | interview process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Questions to Ask at the End
At the conclusion of the interview, the interviewer will typically ask if you have any questions for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This is your opportunity to inquire about:
*   The job itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   Working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
*   Hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
*   Shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>

## Addressing Salary Expectations
If the recruiter has committed to moving you to the next round of interviewing but hasn't yet covered salary expectations, this is an appropriate time to bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. You can state your interest in the opportunity and, to ensure alignment for the next round, ask to discuss compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

> [!TIP] Example Phrase for Salary Discussion
> "I'm really interested in this opportunity, but in order for me to commit to the next round, I just want to make sure that we're on the same page. Can we talk compensation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>

The question of salary expectation is a pivotal part of the job interview process, often asked by recruiters to determine if a candidate's expectations align with the company's budget for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Answering this question incorrectly can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### The Recruiter's Perspective
Recruiters legitimately want to know a candidate's [[discussing_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Their primary goal is to ensure that if an offer is extended, the candidate will not only accept but also be excited about the compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Offering a salary below a candidate's expectation can lead to dissatisfaction, prompting them to seek other opportunities, which means the company might have to refill the position within six to twelve months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Therefore, the salary question is important for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Reputable employers seek realistic [[consequences_of_unrealistic_salary_expectations | salary expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>; if your expectations are too high for a company, it might indicate they are not the right fit for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### Impact of Salary Expectations
The interaction between a candidate's [[factors_influencing_salary_decisions_in_job_offers | salary expectations]] and the company's salary band can lead to several scenarios:

#### When Your Salary Expectation is Higher than the Range
If a candidate's expectation is significantly higher than the role's salary band, they are likely to be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Small Gap**: If the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000), there might be room for [[negotiation_strategies_for_salary_expectations | negotiation]] even before further interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. A recruiter might gauge your flexibility or propose hypothetical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Large Gap**: A significant difference (e.g., $25,000) usually means the company cannot make a sensible offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The recruiter might suggest keeping you in mind for a more "enriched" future role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidates**: In rare cases, for a highly talented "superstar candidate," a recruiter might still forward their resume with the higher [[evaluating_salary_benefits_and_job_security_in_new_job_offers | salary expectations]] to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. The hiring manager might then consider "enriching" the role to a higher level (e.g., Level 2 or 3) to justify a wider salary range and accommodate the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. However, this is the exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Honesty is Key**: It is crucial to be honest with your expectations; attempting a "bait and switch" tactic will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

#### When Your Salary Expectation is Lower than the Range
This situation is favorable for the company as it allows them to offer a significant raise, exciting the candidate while still feeling they are getting a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Salary Bands**: Major corporations use salary bands (minimum, midpoint, maximum) based on local market wage surveys and the concept of "internal equity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Internal equity ensures that individuals in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same, preventing new entry-level hires from earning significantly more than experienced employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   **Automatic Adjustment**: If your compensation expectation is below the lowest point of the company's range, your offer will automatically be adjusted up to that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Common Scenarios**: This often occurs with candidates from smaller or less reputable companies that don't have comparable salary bands, or when someone is stepping into a higher-level role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

#### When You Refuse to Answer
Refusing to give a clear answer or being vague about [[approaching_the_question_of_salary_expectations_in_interviews | salary expectations]] will almost certainly lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Deal Breaker**: Recruiters will not put a candidate through a lengthy interview process if they are unsure an offer can be finalized within the company's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Trust**: Vague answers can make a recruiter suspect you are hiding something, casting doubt on your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Frustration**: Attempting to be ambiguous and negotiate only at the offer stage rarely works out well and often annoys the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. If a recruiter senses frustration, it's best to provide an answer to avoid being put in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

### [[how_to_answer_salary_expectation_questions_in_an_interview | How to Answer Salary Expectation Questions in an Interview]]

Before answering, you need to know three key things:
1.  **Average Market Salary**: Research the average salary range for similar roles in your local area using resources like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com. Be realistic and compare jobs in your specific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Company's Expected Pay**: Understand what the company is expecting to pay for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom Line**: Determine your absolute minimum acceptable salary. While you won't share this number, knowing it helps you decide when to walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

There are [[effective_ways_to_discuss_salary_expectations | effective ways to discuss salary expectations]]:

*   **Directly State Your Expectation**: If you know your worth and are confident the company is in a similar ballpark, feel free to provide your actual number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Be prepared to work with this number throughout the rest of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Frame with Market Research**: If you are concerned about being too high or too low, state a range based on your market research. For example: "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between $X to $Y. Does that align with your target?" This shifts the responsibility to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Put the Question Back on the Recruiter**: If you are interested in the opportunity and potentially willing to be flexible, you can ask the recruiter for their ballpark figure. For instance: "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have salary bands that they need to keep within, and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. However, be prepared for the recruiter to push back, so still have an answer ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

Avoiding the question or being ambiguous about salary until the offer stage is one of [[the_pitfalls_of_salary_negotiation_in_job_applications | the pitfalls of salary negotiation in job applications]] and rarely works out well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

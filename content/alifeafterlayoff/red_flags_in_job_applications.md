A real-world example of an extreme job application form highlights numerous [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flags]] that job seekers should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This particular form was sent by an international company's HR department to a talent acquisition manager applying for a US-based remote role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Even if a company is international, if it solicits candidates from a specific geographic area (e.g., the United States), it must adhere to the laws and regulations of that particular country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## General Red Flags in the Application Process

Several early indicators can suggest a low-quality or potentially scam employer:

*   **Human Resources (HR) Handling Recruitment:** If a large corporation's recruiting is handled directly by its Human Resources department instead of a dedicated Talent Acquisition department, it can be a [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. While common in localized factory settings, for larger companies, this might suggest a "scammy role" or a lower-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Lack of Applicant Tracking System (ATS):** The absence of an ATS system, where a company sends a form manually for you to fill out instead of having an online application portal, is another [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Requests for Payment or Cashing Checks:** Be highly aware if an employer tries to ask you to cash any checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This is a common sign of a scam.

If you observe these [[red_flags_in_job_postings | signs of red flags]], it is advisable to vet the opportunity thoroughly, cross-reference information with the company's corporate website, and ensure real people work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## [[illegal_job_application_questions | Illegal Job Application Questions]]

The following questions, often asked in job applications, are considered [[red_flag_interview_questions | illegal]] or discriminatory in the United States and should raise significant concern:

### Personal & Family Status
*   **Civil or Marital Status:** Asking about your civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, or having a significant other) is completely [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This information has no bearing on one's ability to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Children and Childcare:** Inquiring about whether you have children, how many, or if you have childcare during working hours is highly [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Employers have been known to discriminate against individuals with children due to perceived issues like more days off or childcare needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Discrimination based on family status or pregnancy is prohibited by US law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. A legitimate question would be if you can meet the required work schedule, rather than asking about personal family arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### National Origin & Identity
*   **Passports, Nationality, and Country of Birth/Origin:** Direct questions about what passports you hold, your nationality, or your country of birth/origin are [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] in the United States due to anti-discrimination laws regarding national origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The relevant question for an employer is whether you are legally able to work in the country without sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. If international travel is a job requirement, they should ask if you are *able* to meet that travel requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Protected Characteristics
*   **Age:** Asking for an applicant's age on an application in the United States is completely [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] due to age discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. While some countries may have different visa requirements, a US-based role cannot ask this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Religion:** Inquiring about an applicant's religion, or if they have changed religions, is also [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] as religion is a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Discrimination based on religion is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Health & Physical Attributes
*   **Height and Weight:** While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight requirements tend to disproportionately limit employment opportunities for some protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Unless an employer can demonstrate a direct job-related need for these requirements, it may be viewed as illegal under federal law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Many states and local municipalities specifically prohibit discrimination based on height and weight unless it is an actual job requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions and History:** Asking if you have any medical conditions, types of medications, or upcoming surgeries is highly invasive and [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Other Questionable Inquiries
*   **"How serious are you about a full-time remote position?" (on a scale of 1-10):** While not illegal, this is considered a "very strange question" as an applicant would presumably be serious about a job they applied for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Reason for leaving current or past employer:** This is considered a standard and legitimate question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Present location (City and Country):** This is a valid question typically asked in any application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Extreme Examples
> The described application form is an extreme example, containing a remarkable number of [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While it could be a scam or trolling, such an employer is considered a [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag employer]] that should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

It is crucial for job seekers to keep their radar up for these types of [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]] in job applications or [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | job interviews]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Spotting and avoiding such low-quality or potentially scam employers can prevent future issues and help focus on higher-quality job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

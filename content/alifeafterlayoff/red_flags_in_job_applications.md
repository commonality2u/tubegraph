An unbelievable job application shared by a talent acquisition manager on LinkedIn highlights numerous [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags in job applications]], including many [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal job application questions]] that job seekers should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This specific application was for a US-based remote role from an international company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Even if a company is international, if they solicit candidates from a specific geographic area like the United States, they must adhere to the laws and regulations of that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## General Red Flags in the Application Process

Several overarching issues can indicate a low-quality employer or a potential scam:

*   **HR Handling Talent Acquisition** If a reputable, large corporation does not have a dedicated talent acquisition department and recruitment is handled directly by Human Resources, this can be a [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. While common in localized settings like factories, it can suggest a scam or a lower-quality employer for larger entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** If a company sends a manual form to be filled out instead of using an ATS or an online application system, it's another [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>.
*   **Requests for Money or Cashing Checks** Be highly suspicious if an employer asks you to cash any checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:35">[03:19:35]</a>.
*   **Company Legitimacy Concerns** There are doubts whether the sender of such an application is an actual employer or if it's a scam or trolling attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This extreme example serves to highlight what illegal questions are and why they cannot be asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

## Identifying Illegal Questions in Job Applications

The application form contained an astonishing number of [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal job application questions]], particularly for a role based in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Here's a breakdown of the problematic questions:

### Personal Status and Family Life

*   **Civil or Marital Status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>: Asking about marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, or having a significant other) is completely illegal in the United States. It has no bearing on an individual's ability to perform a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Children and Childcare** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>: Questions like "Do you have any kids?", "How many minors?", and "Do you have child care for your children during working hours?" are highly illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Employers have discriminated against parents due to perceived issues like taking days off for sick children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Discrimination based on family status or pregnancy is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Legally, an employer should state job requirements (e.g., specific work hours) and ask if the candidate can meet them, rather than inquire about childcare directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

### National Origin and Background

*   **Passports and Nationality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>: While international travel might be a job requirement, asking "What passports do you hold and National nationality?" and demanding expiration dates is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Disclosing national origin is an [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal job application question]] in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. The correct way to ask is if the candidate can meet specific travel requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **Country of Birth or Origin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>: This question is "absolutely directly illegal" and explicitly listed in EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. It has no bearing on job ability, assuming the candidate is legally able to work in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. The proper question is, "Are you legally able to work in this country without sponsorship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

### Protected Characteristics

*   **Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>: Asking for a candidate's age is illegal in the United States due to age discrimination laws, even if stated for "Visa purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Religion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>: Inquiring about a candidate's religion, or if they have changed religions, is also illegal as religion is a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   **Height and Weight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>: While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight requirements can disproportionately limit employment opportunities for protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. Unless directly related to a job requirement, such inquiries should be avoided, and some states and municipalities specifically prohibit discrimination based on these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>: Asking about medical conditions, medications, or upcoming surgeries is highly invasive and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaway

This example serves as a stark reminder of the types of [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flags during job interviews]] and [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags in job applications]] to watch out for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. Encountering such questions in a job application or interview should raise immediate concerns about the employer's legitimacy, professionalism, or adherence to legal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. Job seekers should keep their radar up to avoid low-quality employers and potential scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

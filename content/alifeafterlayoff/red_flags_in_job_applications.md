A LinkedIn post from a talent acquisition manager highlighted an "unbelievable" job application form sent by an international company for a US-based remote role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the company being international, if they solicit candidates from the United States, they must adhere to US laws and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This form was required to be filled out and sent back as part of their application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

This specific application form, whether a legitimate but unprofessional attempt, a scam, or a troll, contained numerous [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] that job seekers should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## General Red Flags in the Application Process

Certain procedural or structural elements can indicate a low-quality or potentially scammy employer:

*   **HR Department Handling Recruitment** If a large corporation does not have a dedicated talent acquisition department and recruitment is handled directly by Human Resources, this can be a [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While common in localized settings like factories, it's unusual for larger entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Absence of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** If a company sends a manual form to be filled out rather than using an ATS system or an online application, this is another [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Requests for Money or Cashing Checks** Be very cautious if an employer asks you to cash any checks or pay for anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This is a significant indicator of a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you encounter these [[common_red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flags]], it's crucial to vet the opportunity thoroughly. Cross-reference information with the company's corporate website to ensure it's legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Illegal and Inappropriate Application Questions

The application form contained multiple questions that are considered [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] under US federal law, particularly concerning anti-discrimination statutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Personal and Family Status

*   **Marital Status:** Asking about civil or marital status (single, married, divorced, separated, significant other) is completely [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] in the United States and has no bearing on an individual's ability to perform a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The form even prompted for comments to provide additional context regarding marital situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Children and Childcare:** Questions about having children, the number of minors, and childcare arrangements during working hours are highly [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Employers cannot discriminate based on family status or perceived childcare issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Instead, legitimate inquiries should focus on whether a candidate can meet specific work schedule requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### National Origin and Background

*   **Passport and Nationality:** While international travel might be a job requirement, directly asking about passports held, nationality, and passport expiration dates is a [[illegal_job_application_questions | legal hot water]] area due to the disclosure of national origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The correct approach is to ask if the applicant can meet travel requirements to specific locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Country of Birth/Origin:** Asking for an applicant's country of birth or country of origin is explicitly [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] and has no bearing on job ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The appropriate question is whether the applicant is legally able to work in the country without sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Demographic and Health Information

*   **Age:** Requesting an applicant's age is [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] in the United States due to age discrimination laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Religion:** Asking about an applicant's religion, and especially if it has changed from birth, is also [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] as religion is a protected class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Height and Weight:** While not directly illegal in all cases, height and weight requirements can disproportionately limit employment opportunities for some protected groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Unless directly related to a job requirement, such inquiries should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions and History:** Asking about medical conditions, medications, or upcoming surgeries is extremely invasive and [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The only question from the reviewed list that was considered perfectly valid was indicating the applicant's present location (city and country) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

Encountering such a high number of [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal]] and invasive questions on a job application is a significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. It suggests the employer is either unprofessional, attempting a scam, or trolling applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Job seekers should keep their "radar up" for these types of questions, whether on an application or during an interview, and prioritize high-quality employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

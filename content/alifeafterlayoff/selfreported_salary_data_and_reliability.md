This article explores various self-reported salary figures gathered from a Reddit thread, offering insights into real-world compensation across diverse professions. It's important to approach this data with an understanding of its origin and inherent limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Data Source and Disclaimers

The salary data discussed in this article is derived from a Reddit thread where individuals self-reported their actual salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Reliability Disclaimer
> Reddit is considered the "wild wild west," and anyone can post whatever they desire, so these results should be taken "with a little bit of a grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Additionally, there is no 100% guarantee that all self-reported salaries are from the United States, although efforts were made to exclude those obviously not in North America for better comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Despite these caveats, the speaker states that "some of these salaries are absolutely accurate," making the data worth examining, especially for individuals unsure about their career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This analysis may become part of a larger series due to the volume of interesting self-reported salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Observations on Salary Accuracy

While acknowledging the general need for caution, the speaker provides specific observations on the apparent accuracy or surprising nature of various self-reported incomes:

*   **Private Jet Captain**
    An income of approximately $360,000 per year, which varies with overtime, is reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The speaker notes that the base salary is in the low $200,000s, with the remainder from bonuses, holidays, and extra picked-up workdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This figure is deemed "pretty accurate" as it is a difficult position to secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Electrical Substation Design Engineer**
    An annual salary of about $126,000 is reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The speaker believes this is "probably pretty accurate," especially for someone with five to seven years of experience in the power industry, and suggests it could even be higher, potentially up to $150,000 for an electrical engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Medical Coder**
    Earning $31 an hour, equating to about $65,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The speaker, knowing other medical coders, finds this "probably pretty accurate," though notes base rates might be lower (mid-$20s) with overtime bringing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Air Ambulance Pilot**
    Reported income of $80,000 a year seems "shockingly low" given the profession, although the medical industry generally pays lower unless one is a doctor or physician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Air Traffic Controller**
    Claiming around $100,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The speaker feels this might be "underpaid for the amount of responsibility that they have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Underwater Welder**
    Reporting almost $300,000 annually ($216,000 initially stated, then "almost 300") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This is described as "really good good cash" given the dangerous and challenging nature of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Freelance Video Editor**
    Reported daily rates of $500 to $600, translating to $40,000-$50,000 in a bad year and $95,000-$110,000 in a solid year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The speaker notes this wide swing and the constant need to seek new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **EMT**
    An EMT reports earning $15 an hour, described as the "high end starting wage" in their area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The speaker expresses strong agreement that this is "freaking nuts" given the life-saving role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Walmart Yard Driver**
    Reporting $10,000 a month, or $120,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The speaker finds this significant, especially when compared to the much lower wages of EMTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Travel Nurse**
    Staggering rates of $81.50 an hour, and $130 an hour for overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This is seen as "super good dough" due to the ability to choose work hours, though requiring willingness to travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Specialist**
    A self-reported $230,000 with less than one year of experience, holding a PhD from a well-known school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This is deemed "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **Software Engineer**
    Reporting $384,000 in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. The speaker, with experience in technical recruiting, confirms this is "not unrealistic" for someone with five to eight years of experience at a FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) company, with a base likely in the $200,000-$225,000 range and the rest in restricted stock units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Carpenter**
    Claiming $67 an hour including benefits, which could equate to $140,000 a year at 40 hours a week without overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. This is seen as a "not bad gig" for skilled trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Oil Refinery Worker**
    A union job paying $150,000 per year with 401k, pension, and good benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. The speaker does "not doubt this guy's income at all," emphasizing that the oil industry pays very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **School Psychologist**
    Earning $120,000 to $125,000 for 180 days of work, with full benefits and retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This salary took 35 years to achieve on a graduated pay scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. The money and time off can be "pretty good" for those willing to work their way up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

The self-reported data reveals several significant trends in compensation:
*   Individuals in [[salary_transparency_and_disclosure | software development]] can command very high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   Skilled trades offer the potential for substantial income, indicating that a multi-year college education is not always necessary for a "very reasonable income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   First responders, like EMTs, are significantly underpaid relative to the critical service they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

This collection of data provides an "eye-opening look at some of the salaries that are out there" across both traditional and non-traditional jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

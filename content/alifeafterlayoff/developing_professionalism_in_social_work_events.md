Developing [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professionalism]] in social or informal work events is crucial for [[career_management_and_development | career advancement]] and maintaining a credible professional image. Casual interactions, especially outside of regular work hours, can unexpectedly impact one's reputation and relationships within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Oversharing

One significant lesson in professionalism is the danger of [[consequences_of_oversharing_in_a_professional_setting | oversharing]], even innocently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. A personal anecdote highlights this:
The speaker, early in their HR career, was an HR professional and generalist at a manufacturing and global engineering company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While on rotation in a small town, they frequently visited a smaller sister facility to manage staffing, recruiting, and employee relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The speaker became friendly with a line worker, sharing common interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

One weekend, after accepting an invitation to a bar with the co-worker and his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, the conversation inevitably turned to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The co-worker asked about the new, inexperienced supervisor, Joe, whom the speaker was mentoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The speaker made what they thought was an innocent comment: "Yeah Joe's doing well, he's relatively new to his role so he's still growing and I'm helping him with some things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

The following week, the speaker's boss revealed that Joe was upset because the co-worker had reported the speaker was "spreading rumors about him to the employees that he wasn't a good leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The co-worker had gone to Joe's office first thing Monday morning, claiming the speaker had no faith in him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This incident necessitated an apology and clarification to Joe to preserve an effective working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

This experience demonstrated that even seemingly innocent comments can be twisted or used to "stir the pot," leading to credibility issues with management and potentially stunting [[career_management_and_development | long-term career potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Gossip and Negative Associations

A key aspect of [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | workplace professionalism]] is avoiding association with office gossips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. These individuals are often easily identifiable and tend to congregate in common areas, engaging in "water cooler talk" that often involves drama and gossip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Spending time with gossips can lead to:
*   **Being Branded an Office Gossip**: "You are who you hang out with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Leadership teams are aware of who associates with "clicks" that aren't "going places," which can impede [[career_management_and_development | upward mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Crossing Lines**: There's an easy tendency to cross into [[consequences_of_oversharing_in_a_professional_setting | oversharing]] or saying something regrettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Exposure to Negativity**: Gossips often have a negative mindset, constantly complaining about management, company practices, or compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This negativity can "drag you down" and be a significant distraction if you are focused on [[career_management_and_development | upward mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Compromised Relationships**: If you are promoted over a co-worker with whom you've been overly friendly and shared "dirty secrets," it can create awkward and competitive situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. An unscrupulous co-worker might even use shared information against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

It is advisable to get your water, say hellos, and leave the water cooler area to avoid getting "sucked into the drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. As an HR professional, the speaker frequently observed that office gossips were the "usual suspects" in employee relations issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Professionalism at Off-Site Events

Work-related social events, such as happy hours, require heightened caution, especially when alcohol is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. When inebriated, individuals may have "loose lips" or become "too touchy-feely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. There is a fine line between being chummy and potential harassment, which can include off-color jokes that may offend others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

A guiding principle in HR is that "anything that you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Therefore, careful conduct is essential at all work-related events, both during and outside of work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While it's possible to build lasting friendships with co-workers, it is crucial to pick and choose friends very carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Maintaining [[maintaining_professionalism_in_the_workplace | professionalism]] requires being cautious about what is said, how one behaves, and what is shared, particularly in social settings, to protect one's reputation and [[career_management_and_development | career trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

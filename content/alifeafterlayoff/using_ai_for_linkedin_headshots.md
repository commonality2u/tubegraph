If you're looking to update your [[improving_linkedin_profiles_with_ai | LinkedIn profile]] headshot, [[ai_technology_in_creating_professional_photos | AI technology]] offers a fascinating new option [00:00:08]. This method allows users to generate professional-looking headshots from their own selfies [00:00:44].

## How AI Headshot Generation Works

The process typically involves using a dedicated app, such as one called "Remini" [00:01:50]. Users upload a selection of their own selfies (8 to 12 photos are recommended) [00:02:29]. After selecting gender [00:03:49], the app prompts users to choose a reference image or aesthetic for the generated photos, allowing for styles ranging from "modern" to "Korean aesthetic" [00:04:06]. The [[ai_technology_in_creating_professional_photos | AI]] then processes these inputs to create a custom profile, spitting out a variety of professional headshots [00:02:00].

## Examples and Quality of Results

Examples shared by users show that the generated headshots can be "pretty insane" and look like "professional headshots" from various locations [00:02:17]. While some generated images might appear slightly "fake" in certain areas like shoulders [00:02:50], many others look "really convincing" and "quite remarkable" [00:02:53]. The speaker's own experiment yielded results that made them look younger and were considered usable [00:04:39].

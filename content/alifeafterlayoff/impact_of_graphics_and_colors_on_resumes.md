When crafting a resume, certain visual elements like graphics and colors should generally be avoided to ensure the document remains professional and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A resume is a crucial first impression in a tight labor market, and it needs to be clean, concise, and well-crafted to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Graphics and Colors to Avoid

### Bright Graphics and Excessive Colors
It is generally advised to avoid bright graphics and colors on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While some color, such as using a different color for a job title, might be acceptable (e.g., blues, blacks, or possibly magenta), the overall aesthetic should remain simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The primary goal is to keep the resume clean and concise, avoiding any distractions that might divert the interviewer from assessing qualifications for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Graphs, Charts, and Clip Art
Candidates should refrain from including graphs, charts, or clip art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Resumes are considered professional documents, and incorporating too much "colorful stuff" can unfortunately lead to negative judgment, even if the applicant believes it showcases personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Infographics for Skill Proficiency
The use of infographics, particularly those demonstrating skill proficiency (e.g., a bar chart showing a 3 out of 10 rating for a skill), should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. While intended to show proficiency, such visuals can inadvertently highlight a weakness in a skill that may be important to the employer, potentially leading to self-elimination without the applicant realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It is preferable to allow the employer to assess skill levels during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Columns
Multiple columns on a resume can cause issues with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. ATS systems typically parse text from left to right and may struggle to read information across columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This can result in skills listed in subsequent columns being invisible to the system, potentially making the candidate undiscoverable in searches for relevant keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. To ensure maximum discoverability, it is a simple fix to eliminate columns altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Exceptions for Creative Fields
The only exception for using unique or splashy graphics, charts, or infographics is if the applicant is in a creative field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. For example, an art director or graphic designer would have an expectation to demonstrate their creativity through such elements on their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For nearly all other career types, it is best to keep the resume simple and safe, avoiding bold design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

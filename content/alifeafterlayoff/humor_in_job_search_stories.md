A notable anecdote highlights the absurdity that can sometimes arise during the job search process, showcasing [[unusual_job_interview_experiences | unusual job interview experiences]] and [[applicant_frustrations_with_job_search_strategies | applicant frustrations with job search strategies]]. This particular story involves a man, identified by his Twitter handle "Fur," who was set up for an interview with the very company that had just fired him mere weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Unbelievable Setup

After being terminated from his job, Fur was immediately contacted by a recruiter inviting him to interview for the exact same position with the same employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Unbeknownst to the company, they were attempting to re-hire the individual they had just dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Fur, being stable with freelance work and other interview opportunities, decided to "have a little bit of fun" with the situation and documented the entire process on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The confirmed interview was for the same role he had been terminated from, just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Preparations and Disguise

Leading up to the on-site interview, Fur considered wearing either a top hat and mustache or his old uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He ultimately decided on wearing his old uniform combined with a fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Before the interview, the hiring manager called to confirm his appointment, and Fur expressed his excitement about the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This immediately raised questions about the manager's awareness of their own workforce, particularly if they didn't recognize the name of someone they had just fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Upon arrival, Fur's fake mustache went largely unnoticed by the front desk, who would likely have been aware of his previous termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Remarkably, his phone was still connected to the company's Wi-Fi network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. He was then asked to put on a face mask, which he did over his mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## The Interview Process

### Initial Meeting

The initial hiring manager Fur met was someone he hadn't encountered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Fur had intentionally submitted a resume that omitted his old jobs by name, instead using a copy-paste of the job listing itself to maintain his incognito status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

The hiring manager, noticing Fur had skipped lunch, kindly provided him with snacks and a bottle of water, which struck Fur as a positive sign about the company's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Fur's interview was conducted in a different building than his previous workspace, limiting the chances of being recognized by former co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Technical Interview and Continued Generosity

The hiring manager commented that Fur seemed like an "ideal candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, the manager admitted to not being "technical enough to ask you some of the hard questions," indicating a disconnect from the technical work being performed by their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. As a result, an engineer was brought in to conduct the technical portion of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

While waiting for the engineer, Fur received even more snacks, including a large bag of gummy bears and pretzels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Recognition and Interrogation

The engineer who joined the interview recognized Fur, asking, "I think I've seen you around. You ever freelance here before?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Fur cleverly responded, "I freelanced in a lot of places," which was technically not a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The interview with the engineer went well because Fur, naturally, knew the job very thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

After the technical interview, Fur was asked to wait in a different building to meet the engineering team, receiving even *more* snacks along the way, including a full bag of beef jerky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Eventually, the hiring manager returned, now looking "super serious," and asked, "Are you here to really re-interview for your... interview for this job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Fur responded, "I don't understand the re part, but I would like to know more about this role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The atmosphere quickly became awkward, feeling like a "police interrogation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Discovery and Aftermath

It took at least two full interviews, several hours, and "lots of snacks" for the company to realize Fur was the same person they had fired just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The hiring manager became "furious" that Fur had not disclosed his prior termination, despite the company being responsible for contacting him and not recognizing his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Fur explained that he "couldn't recall things changed so much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. As a gesture, Fur offered the furious manager a gummy bear, which was politely declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

It is assumed that Fur was asked to leave the building shortly after this confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

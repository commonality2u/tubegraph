The concept of "quiet quitting" is a new phenomenon gaining traction in the workforce, seen as an extension of the "Great Resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. It's a response to [[workplace_burnout_and_its_effects | burnout]] and a deliberate decision by employees to set boundaries at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Not advocating laziness
> While the idea might sound like "being lazy at work," the speaker clarifies that it's not about advocating laziness or slacking off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Instead, it's about understanding a legitimate shift in employee behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The speaker recommends that a better approach is to keep one's resume updated and strategically plan an exit if unhappy with a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?
Quiet quitting is defined as "effectively quitting your job without quitting your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. It involves reducing one's output to the minimum acceptable standard for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This means doing "just enough to get by," not taking on additional tasks or burdens, and doing the bare minimum to relieve stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## The Rise of the "Coasting Culture"
This phenomenon, also referred to as the "coasting culture," has emerged as professionals strategically dial back their commitment to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. A Business Insider article highlighted this trend, noting that during the pandemic, many began to view work purely as a source of a paycheck, rather than a "higher calling that demands their utmost devotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

Key factors contributing to the "coasting culture" include:
*   **Pandemic Conditions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>:
    *   A hot labor market ensuring job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
    *   The rise of remote work making it harder for managers to monitor effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Exploitation and [[Toxic workplace dynamics | Betrayal]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>: Employees feel they are "done letting companies squeeze Free Labor out of them" after years of feeling exploited with late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **The End of "Hustle Culture"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>: For a long time, the employment market favored employers who demanded significant effort, leading to a "hustle culture" where employees felt compelled to work long hours, take on extra tasks, and be available constantly, even during personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This culture often treated employees as "resources to exploit" for maximum productivity at minimum cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Workplace Shifts
Historically, companies would go through cycles of becoming bloated, then undergoing catastrophic events (like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11) to cut their workforce through layoffs, becoming "leaner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. The period before 2020 saw extended growth and bloat, leading many companies to seek an excuse to "cut the fat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

When the 2020 pandemic hit, many companies made ruthless cuts, often too deep, which fractured the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This led to a significant shift in the market, backfiring on companies as demand screamed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Employees who had lived the "hustle culture," sacrificing years of their lives, felt a deep sense of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

This period marks a "seismic shift in the workplace," moving the pendulum towards employees for the first time since the 1930s with the Fair Labor Standards Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## Generational and Loyalty Shifts
There's also a generational component, with Baby Boomers exiting and Gen Z entering the workforce with a "completely different mentality about the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. The days of being loyal to a company for 20 years are gone and are now seen as antiquated in some circles, with prolonged tenure sometimes leading to falling behind on the employment curve and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

## Establishing Employment Boundaries
The layoffs during the pandemic meant remaining employees had to pick up the slack, leading to [[workplace_burnout_and_its_effects | burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. As a result, people are now unwilling to be loaded down with work, work long hours, or work weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. They are finally establishing "employment boundaries in their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, which is seen as a healthy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

This shift forces employers to re-evaluate how they treat their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. While not advocating for quiet quitting, the speaker encourages individuals to re-evaluate their work situation if they are unhappy with compensation, hours, or treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

### Key Takeaways for Employees:
*   Employees now view jobs primarily as a source of income to support themselves and their families, not as a demanding "higher calling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
*   The mentality is shifting from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   The notion of "my company's not my family" has led many to shed expectations of grueling hours they once accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   After decades of "leaning in," many are now "deciding to lean back" to prevent [[workplace_burnout_and_its_effects | topping over]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

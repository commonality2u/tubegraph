A video recently went viral featuring an account executive at Cloudflare, Britney Peach (@BrittneyPeach on TikTok), who filmed her own [[corporate_layoffs_and_employee_treatment | layoff]] meeting after sensing it was coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The video resonated with many, summarizing common experiences with [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | companies]] that fail to manage [[corporate_layoffs_and_employee_treatment | layoffs]] in a proper fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Layoff Process

The account executive, a relatively new hire who had only been with the company for a few months, was called into an unexpected meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. She anticipated the reason for the meeting because her colleagues had also been called into similar unscheduled meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The unexpected presence of an HR representative on the call is often a clear indicator of a position termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The company's approach involved calling employees one after another, which was described as "ruthless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. However, it was noted that at least the [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | layoffs]] were conducted face-to-face via video call, rather than through mass emails, Slack messages, or revoked building access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Company Justification vs. Employee Reality

The company's representatives, including an HR person named Rosie and a director the employee had never met, stated that the decision to "part ways" was due to the employee not meeting Cloudflare's performance expectations for 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The employee quickly rebutted this claim, highlighting:
*   Her short tenure: she started August 25th and had just completed a three-month ramp-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Limited productive time: she had only about two to two-and-a-half productive weeks in December after her ramp, sandwiched between Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays when productivity is typically low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   High activity: she claimed the highest activity among her team and had three contracts out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   Positive manager feedback: her manager had consistently praised her performance, activity, quick product grasp, and client relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. She noted she had not been placed on a performance improvement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

The employee accurately accused the company of "gaslighting" by blaming her performance when she was a new hire with limited time to produce results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. It was suggested that managers are often unaware of layoff decisions, which are typically made by higher-ups based on impersonal spreadsheets and business strategies, leading to a "cold and calculated" experience for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Severance Agreements
Companies typically offer severance agreements to release them from liability, especially if there's a potential case for unfair treatment or discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

[!NOTE]
Always read a severance agreement carefully and never sign it on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. If pressured or if you suspect unfair targeting, consult an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Lack of Transparency and Empathy

The employee challenged the HR representatives for not having a clear reason for her [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | layoff]] and for not allowing her manager to deliver the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The HR team's responses were vague and non-committal, using general terms like "performance indicators" without providing specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

This evasiveness suggested that the company was trying to categorize her termination as "for performance" which could negatively impact her future rehire eligibility or background checks, despite it appearing to be a broader [[impact_of_layoffs_and_hiring_freezes | layoff]] of multiple peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The HR person's language was described as "calculated" and "non-committal," typical of [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | HR practices]] designed to avoid legal complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

The employee expressed the deeply traumatizing [[impact_of_layoffs_on_employees | impact of layoffs]], especially when delivered impersonally and without clear explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This highlights the emotional toll on employees who have invested "whole energy and life" into a job only to be let go without a perceived valid reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## CEO's Response and Broader Implications

After the video went viral, Cloudflare's CEO acknowledged the "painful" video and the "significant and severe" backlash, stating the mistake was "not being as kind and humane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. However, it was argued that there's no truly "humane" or "kind" way to conduct a [[corporate_layoffs_and_employee_treatment | layoff]], which involves a sudden severing of an emotional work relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

The incident underscored a broader criticism of [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | companies]] making poor planning decisions, such as over-hiring, with the decision-makers rarely facing consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. The speaker contended that those responsible for planning headcount should be held accountable if they hire many people only to terminate them months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

[!NOTE]
In light of the widespread [[impact_of_layoffs_on_tech_job_market | layoffs]] across the tech industry in 2022, 2023, and into 2024, individuals should proactively develop contingency plans and treat their careers as a "free agent" or "CEO of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This involves taking [[proactive_steps_after_witnessing_layoffs | proactive steps after witnessing layoffs]] to protect oneself, including building savings and exploring alternative income streams to mitigate financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

A 60-year-old Wells Fargo employee, Denise Prudhomme, was found dead at her cubicle in the company's Tempe, Arizona office building four days after clocking in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

Denise Prudhomme entered the Wells Fargo office building in Tempe, Arizona, at 7:00 a.m. on Friday, August 16th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This location was an office building, not a branch, likely a corporate headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Four days later, on August 20th, building security called officials regarding "a subject down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. An employee discovered Prudhomme dead in her cubicle while walking around the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Officers pronounced her dead at 4:55 p.m. upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It is believed she had been dead for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Her cubicle was located on the third floor, "tucked away" from the main aisle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Multiple people had complained of a foul odor, initially assuming it was due to plumbing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

A Wells Fargo spokesman expressed deep sadness over the "tragic loss" and stated thoughts and prayers were with the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. They confirmed counselors were available and that they were fully cooperating with the police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. No foul play was suspected; it is believed she likely experienced a health event at her desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Workplace Culture Implications

The incident highlighted concerns about the workplace environment:
*   **Lack of Oversight:** There was no indication that anyone noticed Prudhomme's absence or lack of communication for four full days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Employee Sentiment:** Another employee found it "heartbreaking" and questioned if anyone would check on them if they were in a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The idea that she sat at her desk like that for days made the employee "sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Invisible at Work:** The situation implies a workplace where an employee could be "so invisible" that nobody stops by to check in, grab coffee, or invite them to lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Irony of Return-to-Office Mandates:** This event is particularly ironic given that the finance industry, including Wells Fargo, has been "very adamant about forcing people back into the office" for corporate culture and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The speaker noted that the incident suggests a "broken workplace" where a person could be "completely forgotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. They questioned why no boss was held accountable for not knowing their employee was in the building but had expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, suggesting that her work "couldn't have been all that valuable" if her absence wasn't noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

The incident serves as a stark reminder about personal well-being and professional value:
*   **Seek Appreciation:** If feeling [[reasons_for_employee_dissatisfaction | underappreciated]] in a workplace, it is advisable to find a place that values and notices your presence and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Health:** Employees should place their health and wellness above all else, taking sick days and vacations without guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control:** The speaker emphasized that individuals are often just "a cog in a wheel" or "a number on a spreadsheet" at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It is crucial to "reclaim control" and "act like the CEO of your career" because "nobody else is looking out for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **[[experiences_of_tech_workers_with_unexpected_job_loss | Implications of Getting Fired]]:** The speaker expressed a cynical view that the company would likely have the position posted and filled within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The incident was described as "particularly disappointing" and a situation where "everybody dropped the ball," concluding that Denise "deserved better than this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

A corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience, having interviewed and hired thousands of people for large and well-known companies, offers a subjective ranking of 15 job search methods based on their effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) [01:00:58]. The goal of these rankings is to help job seekers find a job as quickly as possible while spending the least amount of time for the biggest "bang for their buck" [01:15:21]. Methods are scored on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most effective and 1 being the least [01:37:35]. The rankings also consider whether a method favors blue-collar or white-collar workers [01:32:00].

## Least Effective Strategies (Score: 1-3)

### Cold Calling (1/10)
Cold calling involves soliciting a job without knowing if the employer has an open position [01:49:15]. This can include calling a switchboard for the human resources department, dropping in unannounced to an office, or sending unsolicited notes to people on LinkedIn [01:56:00]. From a corporate recruiter's perspective, cold calling almost never works and is generally not a good use of time [02:15:35].

### Social Media Engagement (1/10)
Engaging with a company's social media channels (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) with the hope of being noticed by a hiring team is very unlikely to lead to an interview [02:40:00]. This is because HR and talent acquisition teams typically do not manage or monitor social media; these tasks usually fall to the marketing department [02:47:00]. The speaker has never hired someone through social media engagement [03:15:00]. This method is considered a form of cold calling [03:24:00].

### Job Fairs (2/10)
Job fairs can sometimes be effective, especially for blue-collar roles or entry-level positions through university events [03:54:00]. However, from an employer's viewpoint, the chances of finding highly qualified candidates are slim, often yielding only one or two promising resumes per day [04:03:00]. For job seekers, it can be like "window shopping" and is not a highly targeted [[effectiveness_of_different_job_search_strategies | job search strategy]] due to stiff competition [04:57:00]. Generally, they offer a low return for the time invested [04:53:00].

### Industry Events / In-Person Networking (3/10)
Similar to job fairs, in-person industry events often involve awkward small talk with unfamiliar people [05:35:00]. The likelihood of someone at the event having an open job that perfectly matches your qualifications and interest is low [05:40:00]. While such events can help in making long-term contacts, they are generally not a targeted way to find a job quickly and may be difficult for introverts [06:00:00].

### Online Forums (3/10)
Online forums, including Reddit, tech forums, or LinkedIn groups, allow networking within specific industries [06:22:00]. However, they are often not a targeted method for active job searching [06:37:00]. When a job is posted or an employer responds, it can lead to a "feeding frenzy" of competition [06:50:00]. While recruiters may use these forums to find candidates with demonstrated expertise, actively building a knowledge repository solely for job seeking is not the most efficient use of time for a quick job search [07:10:00].

## Moderately Effective Strategies (Score: 4-6)

### Professional Associations (4/10)
Joining professional associations, such as the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) in HR, can be beneficial, particularly for white-collar professionals [07:42:00]. Becoming known as an expert by participating in committees or taking on leadership roles can help in branding oneself within a local labor market [08:04:00].

### Company Websites (5/10)
Applying directly on a company's website ensures that your resume is seen by a recruiter, as it filters directly into their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) [08:30:00]. This is often preferred by recruiters over applications from external [[using_job_boards_effectively | job boards]], which might require manual checking [08:50:00]. If a job is seen on a job board, it's advisable to apply directly on the company's site for a slightly higher chance of visibility [09:11:00].

### Headhunters / Agencies (5/10)
Headhunters (or third-party recruiters/agencies) are contracted by employers to fill positions and often work with multiple companies and roles [09:26:00]. While they might keep your resume on file for other opportunities, the effectiveness often "fizzles" after you are considered for a primary role [09:54:00]. Job seekers should not rely solely on agencies but instead use them as a supplement to their own [[effective_job_search_strategies | job search strategies]] [10:19:00].

### Simple Websites / Blogs (5/10)
Creating a personal website or blog to brand oneself as an expert and showcase a portfolio of work can be highly effective, especially for creative fields like design, motion, or photography [10:44:00]. Writing niche content can attract companies looking for specific expertise [11:06:00]. While setting up a site is relatively easy, it requires more effort and is a longer-term strategy, not yielding immediate results [11:25:00].

### Job Boards (6/10)
[[using_job_boards_effectively | Job boards]] like LinkedIn and Indeed are the most common way people look for jobs [11:39:00]. The main challenge is competing with many other applicants, sometimes thousands for a single posting [11:48:00]. Recruiters often source candidates through other methods as well [12:02:00]. The speaker estimates only 5-10% of their jobs are filled through active job postings because many applicants are not well-aligned with the hiring manager's needs [13:32:00]. Despite the effort and potential for [[applicant_frustrations_with_job_search_strategies | frustration]], it only takes one offer to get re-employed, making it a worthwhile activity [13:12:00].

## Most Effective Strategies (Score: 7-10)

### Online Networking (7/10)
Online networking, primarily through platforms like LinkedIn, is less intimidating than in-person events [13:20:00]. Targeted online networking is powerful, but it requires proper etiquette; sending unsolicited connection requests or InMails is ineffective [13:29:00].

### Responding to Advertisements (7/10)
Responding to physical advertisements like "help wanted" signs, billboards, or truck ads can be effective [14:03:00]. Such advertisements often indicate that a company is struggling to find applicants, increasing the chance of your resume being seen [14:48:00]. This method is generally more effective for blue-collar jobs than white-collar roles, as major corporations rarely use front-door signs [14:56:00].

### Internships / Co-ops (7/10)
For entry-level job seekers with little to no relevant experience, internships or co-ops are highly recommended [15:10:00]. They provide a significant advantage over competitors, offer a foot in the door at an organization, and allow you to build rapport and goodwill with hiring managers [15:23:00].

### Industry Contacts (8/10)
Leveraging industry contacts, especially former bosses or close colleagues who are now at other organizations, is a powerful way to secure a job [15:43:00]. These contacts can often pull you along to their new company, potentially bypassing a lengthy interview process or leading to a "courtesy interview" [16:07:00]. They typically ensure a fair or even higher compensation rate, as they are aware of your previous earnings [16:36:00]. Maintaining relationships with influential people in your network is crucial [16:49:00].

### Employee Referrals (8/10)
Employee referrals are exceptionally powerful [16:56:00]. If you know someone working at a company you're interested in, reaching out for a referral is highly recommended [17:04:00]. Referred candidates often receive preference and a direct path to the interview process [17:13:00]. The only candidates who get higher preference than employee referrals are internal applicants [17:16:00].

### Outbound Sourcing / Discoverability (10/10)
Outbound sourcing is the most preferred method for recruiters, accounting for 80% or more of how they fill positions [17:44:00]. This involves recruiters actively searching the market (e.g., LinkedIn) to find candidates who closely match the desired profile [17:53:00]. While job seekers cannot control what a recruiter is looking for, they can optimize their profiles to be discoverable [18:03:00]. If a recruiter finds you, you are pulled to the front of the line and can often bypass the initial application process [18:12:00]. Understanding how recruiters source candidates and making oneself discoverable is the single best thing a job seeker can do for their [[strategies_for_job_seekers_to_navigate_the_job_market | active job search]] [18:35:00].

## Recommended Job Search Strategy

For an effective job search, focus on improving your discoverability, optimizing your LinkedIn profile, and actively networking with the right people [18:49:00]. Leverage industry contacts and seek employee referrals [18:54:00]. While less effective, applying to jobs on job boards should still be part of your strategy, as it only takes one offer to become employed again [19:00:00].

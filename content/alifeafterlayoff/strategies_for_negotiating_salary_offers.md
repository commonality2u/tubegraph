When interviewing for a new role, the question about your [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectation]] is almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Answering this question incorrectly can lead to rejection, and avoiding it altogether yields the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article provides strategies on how to best [[handling_salary_discussions_during_interviews | handle salary discussions during interviews]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Why Recruiters Ask About Salary Expectations

Recruiters typically ask about your [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectation]] towards the end of an interview, especially if they are interested in moving you to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The primary reason is to determine if your expectations align with the company's established [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary band]] for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This information is crucial for recruiters to include in their initial submission to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The question is generally not a trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Recruiters genuinely want to ensure that if an offer is extended, you will not only accept but also be excited and feel satisfied with the compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Accepting a salary below your expectations can lead to dissatisfaction and a tendency to seek other opportunities, which employers want to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Therefore, the [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary question]] is important for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Scenarios When Discussing Salary

### 1. Your Salary Expectation is Higher Than the Company's Range
If your [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectation]] is too high for the role, you might be moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Slight Difference:** If the difference is minor (e.g., $10,000 apart), there might be some [[salary_negotiation_and_counteroffers | negotiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. A recruiter might offer hypothetical scenarios to gauge your flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Significant Difference:** If you're $25,000 apart, it's unlikely an offer can be made that satisfies you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The recruiter might suggest keeping you in mind for a future, more senior role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Superstar Candidate Exception:** For exceptional candidates, a recruiter might still forward your resume with the higher [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary expectations]] to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. In rare cases, the hiring manager might agree to enrich the role (e.g., make it a Level 2 or 3 position) to open up wider [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary ranges]] and accommodate your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, this is an exception, not the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Be honest with your expectations. Trying a "bait and switch" tactic by misrepresenting your desired salary will not work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### 2. Your Salary Expectation is Lower Than the Company's Range
This is a favorable situation for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Major corporations have defined [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary bands]] (minimum, midpoint, maximum) based on market wage surveys and internal equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Internal equity ensures that individuals in similar roles within the organization are compensated relatively the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

If your compensation expectation is below the lowest point of the company's range, you will automatically be offered at least that minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This often occurs when a candidate comes from a less reputable or smaller company without comparable [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary bands]], or when stepping into a higher-level role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### 3. Refusing to Answer the Question
Refusing to give a clear answer or providing vague responses will likely lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Recruiters will not move you forward in the interview process without knowing if a deal can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Hiding your expectations can also raise doubts about your transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Attempting to be ambiguous during interviews and only negotiating at the offer stage rarely works out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Hiring managers may become annoyed if they spend time on a candidate they cannot afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. If a recruiter seems frustrated, provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Preparing to Answer the Salary Question

To effectively answer the question, you need to know three key things:

1.  **Average Market Salary Range:** Research the average [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary range]] for similar roles in your local area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Use resources like Google, Glassdoor, or Salary.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Ensure you compare roles in your specific geographic location, as salaries can vary significantly (e.g., Alabama vs. Bay Area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **Company's Expected Pay:** While harder to pinpoint exactly, try to understand what the company typically pays for this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  **Your Bottom Line Salary Expectation:** Determine the absolute minimum salary you are willing to accept. This is the point at which you must be prepared to walk away from an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. You don't necessarily share this number with the recruiter, but you need to know it for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Strategies for Answering the Salary Question

### 1. Directly State Your Expectation
If you are confident in your worth and believe the company is in a similar [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary ballpark]], you can directly state your desired number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Be mindful that this number will be used throughout the process, so ensure it is reasonable and something you can live with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### 2. Frame it with Market Research
If you are concerned about receiving a [[how_to_handle_lowball_job_offers | lowball job offer]] or if your expectations are significantly higher than what you think the company might be expecting, frame your answer based on your market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:

> "From the research that I've done in the local market, similar types of roles are paying between $90,000 to $110,000. Does that align with your target?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

This approach puts the onus on the company to disclose if their compensation is below market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. You can then decide if you want to work for a company that isn't competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### 3. Put the Question Back on the Recruiter
If you are interested in the opportunity and potentially willing to accept a lower salary, or want to avoid pricing yourself out, you can shift the question back to the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>:

> "While I've been compensated very fairly in the past, an offer is more than just the cash compensation. I understand that companies have [[salary_negotiation_and_expectation_management | salary bands]] that they need to keep within, and I respect that. Can you give me a ballpark of where the typical candidate that you're talking to is coming in, and I can tell you if that fits?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

A recruiter will often provide this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, be prepared for them to push back and insist you answer first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. You still need to have a prepared answer, but avoid avoiding the question entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Ultimately, open and honest [[salary_negotiation_tactics_in_hr | salary negotiation tactics]] during interviews are crucial for finding a role that meets your needs and ensures job satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

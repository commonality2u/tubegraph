This article aims to provide insights into what corporate recruiters *really* mean when they say certain things during an interview, offering an insider's advantage in the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The information shared comes from a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Types of Recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

It's important to distinguish between two main types of recruiters:

*   **Headhunters (Third-Party Recruiters)**: These are external parties contracted by companies to fill positions, typically on a contingency basis, meaning they get paid a portion of the candidate's first-year salary upon placement (usually 15-25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Headhunters generally have less in-depth knowledge of the role compared to internal recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Corporate Recruiters (Internal Recruiters)**: These individuals are full-time employees within a company's talent acquisition or HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Their primary goal is to find the best possible fit for their hiring manager, as this is their key performance metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Corporate recruiters often support specific functional groups and develop strong relationships with hiring managers, leading to clear alignment on position requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This insider information is specifically geared towards the [[preparing_for_corporate_recruiter_interviews | internal corporate recruiter's interview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The initial interview with a corporate recruiter is usually a screening interview to assess baseline competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Deciphering Recruiter Statements

Here's a breakdown of common recruiter phrases and their true meanings:

### "What do you know about the company?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> "What do you know about the company?" or "What do you know about the position?"

**What they mean:** This is a critical first interview question. If you haven't researched the company or the role, it's a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Your preparedness indicates your level of interest and future engagement in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Asking About Specific Skills or Experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> "Do you have a specific skill or experience?"

**What they mean:** These are baseline requirements for success in the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. If you lack a key competency, the recruiter will likely not advance you to the next round, as the hiring manager needs to see these on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While not 100% true in every instance, it's generally a strong indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Repeatedly Rephrasing Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> (Repeatedly rephrasing a question or bringing you back to the same question.)

**What they mean:** You are likely missing the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Each question is designed to assess a specific competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It's acceptable to ask for clarification, e.g., "Can you please give me an idea of what it is that you're looking for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Rambling Without Follow-Up Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> (You ramble on for a long time, and the recruiter doesn't ask follow-up questions.)

**What they mean:** You are almost certainly moving to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Long-winded answers are often seen as a "kiss of death" because hiring managers interpret it as an inability to communicate effectively and influence senior leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Answer concisely and directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Not Asking About Compensation Expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> (The recruiter does not ask about your compensation expectations towards the end of the interview.)

**What they mean:** You are almost certainly in the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The recruiter has already determined you're not a fit, so your salary expectations are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Discussing Compensation Expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> "The salary range we are scoping for this role is between X and Y. It's a little bit lower than what you're expecting. Would you be open to that?"

**What they mean:** This is a genuine question about your willingness to consider the company's range, allowing for [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_recruiters | negotiation]] if there's a small gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> "This position is scoped a little lower than you're expecting. If you don't mind, I'll give you a call when I have a more enriched role."

**What they mean:** This is a polite way of saying the company cannot afford you for this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If the difference is more than $10,000-$15,000, the position likely doesn't align with your realistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### "Do you have any questions for me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> "Do you have any questions for me?"

**What they mean:** The interview is effectively over, and the recruiter has likely already decided whether to move you forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This is a formality or an opportunity for you to gather information to decide if the company is a mutual fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Trying to "Sell" the Job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> (The recruiter tries to sell you the job and get you excited about it.)

**What they mean:** They believe you are a potentially great fit and intend to send you to the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. They are already attempting to pre-sell you in anticipation of a potential offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Wrapping Up the Interview Quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> (The interview wraps up in 10-15 minutes.)

**What they mean:** You are likely not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Recruiters often know within 5-7 minutes if a candidate is a decent fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Make your best first impression to get past the first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### General Closing Statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> "We've had a lot of interest in the position, and we just started interviewing. We'll be back to you whenever we've completed all of our interviews."

**What they mean:** You probably are not moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For a strong candidate, the recruiter would likely be trying to "pre-sell" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This reflects their [[interpreting_recruiter_signals_about_candidate_fit | recruiter signals about candidate fit]].

> [!NOTE] What the Recruiter Says:
> (The recruiter introduces the hiring manager and tells you they will schedule you on their calendar.)

**What they mean:** This is a very positive sign that you are moving forward in the interviewing process, and things look solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This is a clear indicator of positive [[understanding_recruiter_and_hiring_manager_dynamics | recruiter and hiring manager dynamics]].

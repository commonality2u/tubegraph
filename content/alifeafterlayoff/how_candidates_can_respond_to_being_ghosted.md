[[reasons_for_employment_ghosting | Employment ghosting]] occurs when an employer or company representative moves a candidate into a formalized interviewing process and then fails to follow up on the application's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>. This is considered poor [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | candidate experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a> and can be frustrating for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

While there isn't "a whole lot" a candidate can do when they suspect they've been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:52">[09:51:52]</a>, there is one primary action recommended:

### Send a Nudge to the Recruiter
If you suspect you've been ghosted, you can send the recruiter a "nudge" after some time to inquire about the status of your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:52">[09:53:52]</a>. This simple action can prompt the recruiter to:
*   Go in and properly close out your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:10">[10:00:10]</a>.
*   Provide you with a status update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:10">[10:00:10]</a>.

Although being ghosted is a "poor form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:15">[09:45:15]</a> of communication, this proactive step can sometimes lead to a resolution or clarification from the employer.

Improving your [[the_impact_of_linkedin_on_the_job_market | LinkedIn]] profile is crucial for career development, and [[ai_technology_in_creating_professional_photos | AI technology]] is now offering new ways to enhance its visual appeal, particularly through professional headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Professional Headshots

Your headshot is one of the first impressions made on your [[the_impact_of_linkedin_on_the_job_market | LinkedIn]] profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Not having a good headshot means missing an opportunity to brand yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Many people use "not so great" photos, which can hinder attracting the right opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. A good profile picture is a necessity to attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

[[Using AI for LinkedIn headshots | AI]] provides a potential "game changer" for those who don't have a professional headshot they like, offering an alternative to traditional photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This emerging [[ai_technology_in_creating_professional_photos | AI technology]] can create convincing professional headshots from ordinary selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## How the Remini App Works

The app discussed, called Remini, allows users to upload 8 to 12 selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. After selecting a gender and a reference image or aesthetic, the app processes these photos to generate a variety of professional-looking headshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The generation process takes a few minutes to render <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Observed Results and Impressions

The results from Remini can be quite convincing, producing professional headshots that look legitimate and place the subject in different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While some AI-generated photos might look slightly artificial upon close inspection (e.g., shoulders), many are remarkably realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The speaker found some of the generated photos to be good, even making them "look younger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The technology is described as "pretty remarkable" and "pretty insane" in its ability to create seamless professional images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Impact on Photographers
This [[ai_technology_in_creating_professional_photos | AI technology]] presents a dilemma for headshot photographers, potentially impacting a once lucrative industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Considerations for Using AI-Generated Headshots

A primary concern with [[using_ai_for_linkedin_headshots | AI-generated headshots]] is the potential for "catfishing," where the photo does not accurately represent the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It is recommended to use source photos that accurately reflect your current appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The tool should be used to provide a clean and professional look, not to completely misrepresent oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

If you want to upgrade your [[the_impact_of_linkedin_on_the_job_market | LinkedIn]] profile without the expense of professional headshots, this [[ai_technology_in_creating_professional_photos | AI technology]] is a highly recommended option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Broader LinkedIn Strategy

The ultimate goal of enhancing a [[the_impact_of_linkedin_on_the_job_market | LinkedIn]] profile is to gain more traction on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Building a profile that increases the likelihood of recruiters noticing you is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It is generally easier to secure a job when recruiters solicit you directly, rather than competing with hundreds of other applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Techniques exist to help you stand out and get to the front of the line in job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

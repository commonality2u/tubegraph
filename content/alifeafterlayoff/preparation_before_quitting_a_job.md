When preparing to quit a job, it's crucial to approach the process with grace and dignity to ensure a smooth transition and maintain professional relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Leaving a job improperly can lead to being ineligible for rehire, burning bridges, and negatively impacting your professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This can even affect future [[job_search_tips_and_resources_after_quitting_a_job | job search opportunities]], as former colleagues might be hesitant to refer you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Keep Your Job Search Confidential

It is highly recommended not to tell anyone at your current job that you are looking to leave until you are absolutely ready to move on and have secured another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Telling your boss too soon can put you at [[risks_of_quitting_a_job_without_a_clear_plan | risk]] of being let go sooner than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The adage "it's a lot easier to find a job when you have a job" holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Even close work friends should not be privy to your job search plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Rumors can spread quickly, potentially biting you if something unexpected happens with your new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Maintaining discretion keeps you in control and ensures professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Secure Your New Opportunity

Before giving notice, ensure you have all your "ducks in a row" for your new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This includes:
*   Completing and receiving results for any required drug screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Having background checks finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Ensuring all pre-employment requirements are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Most importantly, having a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

It's not uncommon for job offers to be rescinded due to issues with background checks or other pre-employment verifications, even after a candidate has given notice to their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Waiting for a "green light" from the new company, indicating all checks are cleared and a start date is firm, is the safest approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Plan Your Announcement

Once you have a confirmed start date, the next step is to set up a meeting with your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Method:** This meeting should ideally be face-to-face or via a video call, not through email or text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Content:** Keep the conversation concise and professional. Provide only the minimum necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. For example, "I have another opportunity that came my way, and it's the best move for my family. I wanted to thank you for your time, but I am giving my two weeks' notice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Avoid Negativity:** Refrain from elaborating on negative reasons for leaving, such as issues with management or the work environment, as this can escalate emotions and serve no productive purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Your decision should be firm, and engaging in arguments or emotional outbursts is unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Be Prepared for Counteroffers:** As discussed in other content, be prepared not to entertain counteroffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Informing Others

After informing your boss, ask for their guidance on when and how to inform your team members, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Following proper protocol ensures you leave a positive impression on your boss and the broader organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Give Two Weeks' Notice

Providing at least two weeks' notice is a courtesy that allows you to tie up loose ends and assists the company in managing the workload void your departure will create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While not legally required in many places, it's a professional gesture primarily beneficial to your co-workers, who would otherwise have to scramble to cover your responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Farewell to Colleagues

On your last day, or near it, gather relevant team members (if local) or call those particularly influential to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Maintain Positivity:** State generally that you have a better opportunity that is good for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Express Gratitude:** Emphasize positive aspects, such as enjoying working with the team and appreciating the opportunity for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Avoid trashing the company or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Networking:** Personally thank individuals instrumental in your career, such as mentors or trainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Ask to connect on professional platforms like LinkedIn to build your personal network, as these connections are valuable for future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

By taking the high road and being professional, you maintain a good working relationship that could prove beneficial in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. You never know if you might need to return to the organization or if former colleagues will move to new companies where you might want to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Leaving on good terms reflects positively on your "employment brand" and follows you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

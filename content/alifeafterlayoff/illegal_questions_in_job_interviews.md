Encountering [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags]] during an interview can indicate a poor-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. One significant [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag]] is when an interviewer asks illegal questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Even if hiring managers have limited interview training and are unaware that certain questions are illegal, it does not excuse their inappropriateness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Categories of Illegal Questions

### Personal and Discriminatory Questions
Certain questions are entirely off-limits in an interview setting, particularly those related to race, gender, sex, creed, or color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These questions are considered discriminatory because they have no bearing on a candidate's ability to perform the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Family Planning** Questions like, "Are you planning to start a family?" are discriminatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Employers asking this might be trying to determine if they will need to pay for maternity or paternity leave, or they may assume a lack of long-term commitment to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Religion** Inquiries about a candidate's religion, such as asking if they will need time off for daily prayers, are illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Interview questions must be job-specific and directly related to the ability to perform the job duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Compensation History
Asking about a candidate's previous compensation is another question that is illegal in many states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The rationale behind this legislation is that a candidate should be paid what the job is worth and based on the value they bring, not what they were previously paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. A candidate should not be disadvantaged in their career simply because they were previously stuck in a low-paying job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

If an employer asks any of these [[illegal_job_application_questions | illegal questions]], it should be considered a significant [[red_flags_during_job_interviews | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Job seekers should be wary, as one bad employer can set back a career by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

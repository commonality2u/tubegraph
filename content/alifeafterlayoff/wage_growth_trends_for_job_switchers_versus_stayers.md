## Defining Job Hopping
Job hopping is characterized as jumping from one job to another in a relatively short amount of time, typically at the same career level without definitive progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Employers often view it negatively, as it can indicate an employee may not stay long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. While employers are quick to lay off staff, creating a double standard, employees have successfully used [[understanding_the_risks_of_jobhopping | job hopping]] to rapidly move through salary bands, particularly earlier in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. However, there's a point of diminishing returns; [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | salary growth]] slows significantly after the entry-level range, leading to [[challenges_with_job_hopping_and_resume_instability | resume instability]] and the need to defend frequent job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## The Era of Lucrative Job Hopping
The strategy of [[understanding_the_risks_of_jobhopping | job hopping]] for rapid [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | salary progression]] gained significant popularity among new entrants to the [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | workplace]] between 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This was especially true during the peak of the [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | job market]] for job seekers, roughly from 2021 to 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

In 2020, the [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | job market]] experienced massive [[dealing_with_high_turnover_and_job_insecurity | layoffs]] and minimal hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. However, it rebounded strongly in 2021 and 2022, particularly in the tech sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Roles like software developers became highly sought after, allowing early-career professionals to advance much faster than previously typical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This environment enabled individuals to secure 10%, 15%, or even 20% salary bumps without remaining in roles for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Initially concentrated in tech, this trend of using [[understanding_the_risks_of_jobhopping | job hopping]] to improve financial circumstances spread to other industries due to the heated [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This period also coincided with "the great resignation," where people left careers knowing they could find new employment quickly, often at a higher salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## The Shift in the Job Market (2023-2024)
The highly favorable job market began to decline in 2023 and has continued into 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Currently, finding well-paying jobs is particularly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, published by the Wall Street Journal, reveals significant trends in [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | wage growth]] for those who stay in their jobs versus those who switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Overall Wage Growth
Overall [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | wage growth]] saw a massive uptick during the hot [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | job market]] of 2022-2023, reaching the highest levels since at least 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Companies like Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Google fueled this increase through bidding wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. For example, in 2022, senior software developers, especially principal-level engineers, easily found multiple better offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

However, this period of high [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | wage growth]] lasted only about a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Since then, there has been a steady decrease, as [[employer_perspectives_on_job_hopping | employers]] have tightened up and actively sought to bring wages down, leading to lower offers and reduced raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. This "resetting the market" has also involved significant [[dealing_with_high_turnover_and_job_insecurity | layoffs]] and restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

### Wage Growth for Job Switchers vs. Stayers
Analyzing data from January 2022 through January 2025:
*   **January 2022:** A job switcher saw a 4.7% average wage increase, compared to 3.7% for someone who stayed in their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Despite these increases, both groups were still falling behind due to high inflation (around 6-8% at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. It still made sense to switch jobs to gain a larger increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
*   **June 2022:** Job switchers received a 6.4% increase, while stayers saw 4.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Companies were improving wages to retain employees, but they struggled to compete with the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   **October/November 2022 (Peak):** This was the peak of the [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Job switchers saw an average increase of 7.7%, more than 2% higher than those who stayed in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Companies were still focused on staff retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   **May 2023 onwards:** The [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | wage market]] began to break. Wage growth for job switchers started declining, followed by a decline for internal retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. [[employer_perspectives_on_job_hopping | Employers]] started reducing wages, leading to an increase in job applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. With more options, companies could be more selective and pay less, following the law of supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **January 2025 (Projected/Current Trend):** The incentive for leaving jobs has significantly decreased. Job switchers are projected to see a 4.8% increase, while stayers receive 4.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Current Viability of Job Hopping
Based on current [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | labor market]] data, relying on [[understanding_the_risks_of_jobhopping | job hopping]] as a primary strategy for significant [[wage_stagnation_and_career_progression_in_the_job_market | salary increases]] is no longer as lucrative as it was a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. While strategic job changes, especially those that include a promotion in level, may still offer some upward mobility, the substantial wage bumps seen previously are largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## Alternative Career Strategies
Given the current market, focusing on a [[career_strategies_beyond_job_hopping | long-term career strategy]] is recommended. This involves:
*   Taking calculated steps in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   Building in-demand skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   Effectively marketing your skills through resumes, interviews, and networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   Establishing a clear personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

These approaches can compel career progression more effectively than a series of hops at the same level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. The current mantra for companies is to retain desired staff, become more efficient (potentially through AI utilization), and "right-size" their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

This article explores various self-reported salaries, highlighting how different levels of education and specialized skills can influence earning potential. The data is primarily sourced from a Reddit thread where individuals disclosed their actual incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It's important to note that these figures are self-reported and may not all originate from the United States, so they should be taken with a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Salaries Linked to Higher Education & Specialized Knowledge

Certain professions, often requiring advanced degrees or highly specialized knowledge, command significant incomes:

*   **Private Jet Captain**: An income varying with overtime, potentially reaching around $360,000 per year, with a base salary in the low $200,000s supplemented by bonuses, holidays, and extra work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This position requires significant skill and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Electrical Substation Design Engineer**: This role typically earns around $126,000 annually, with potential for higher earnings (up to $150,000) for those with five to seven years of experience, due to the specialized nature of electrical design in the power industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision (IT Technical Person)**: An individual with a PhD from a well-known school in this field, with less than one year of experience, reported making $230,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Software Engineer**: A software engineer can achieve a total compensation of $384,000, which is considered very doable, especially for backend developers with five to eight years of experience working for large, well-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Travel Nurse**: Working for an agency, a travel nurse reported earning $81.50 per hour, with overtime reaching $130 per hour. The nursing shortage allows these professionals to control their hours and income significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **School Psychologist**: A school psychologist in public schools reported earning $120,000 to $125,000 for 180 days of work, with full benefits and retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This salary, achieved after 35 years, reflects high tenure and a graduated pay scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### Instances of Low Pay Despite Advanced Education

Not all advanced degrees guarantee high income, as seen with:

*   **Research (Brain Cells, HIV, Cocaine, Fentanyl)**: An individual with a Master's degree in this research field reported making only $29,500 per year, equivalent to $14 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This raises concerns about the [[impact_of_high_education_costs_and_student_loans | cost versus benefit of getting a master's degree]] when facing poverty-level wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## High-Earning Skilled Trades

Many skilled trades offer substantial incomes without requiring multi-year university degrees:

*   **Nuclear Plant Electrician**: Earning $50 an hour, this position can yield $130,000 to $150,000 per year depending on overtime and bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Underwater Welder**: This highly dangerous and specialized trade can earn between $216,000 and nearly $300,000 annually, showing that individuals good with their hands and willing to work in extreme conditions can achieve "physician-level income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Carpenter (Union)**: A union carpenter reported making $67 an hour including benefits, which translates to $140,000 annually at 40 hours a week without including any overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Oil Refinery Worker**: A union job in an oil refinery can pay $150,000 per year, with additional benefits like a 401k and pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. The oil industry is known for paying very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   **Officer on a Container Ship**: Working approximately six months out of the year, an officer can earn about $120,000, presenting an attractive situation for those who can manage being away from home for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Medical Coder**: This role, which typically does not require a bachelor's degree, pays around $31 an hour, equating to $65,000 annually. With overtime, some coders can reach $35 to $38 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Disparities in Salary Outcomes

Some essential and demanding jobs surprisingly yield lower salaries:

*   **Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)**: Despite being first-line responders who save lives and deal with horrific situations, EMTs make shockingly low wages, with $15 an hour considered high-end, and some experienced advanced EMTs earning as little as $10.50 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This starkly contrasts with other professions, leading to questions about [[salary_and_benefits_issues | salary and benefits issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Air Ambulance Pilot**: An air ambulance (helicopter life-flighting) pilot reported making $80,000 a year, which seems "shockingly low" for such a specialized and critical role, even considering the medical industry's generally lower pay outside of doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Air Traffic Controller**: Earning around $100,000 a year, this profession is considered one of the most stressful jobs on the planet due to the immense responsibility for thousands of lives. The reported salary might be "underpaid for the amount of responsibility" involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Professional Theater Actress**: A professional theater actress reported making $568 per week before taxes, roughly $29,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This highlights that following a passion in the arts may not be financially lucrative, often requiring "side waitressing" to supplement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Other Professions and Their Earning Potential

*   **Walmart Yard Driver**: This role involves moving trucks in a distribution warehouse and can surprisingly earn $10,000 a month, totaling $120,000 a year, even with reasonable overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Restaurant Manager (Well-Known Chain)**: A manager at a well-known restaurant chain reported a base salary of $75,000 with an additional $20,000 to $25,000 annual bonus, bringing their total income to around $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Strip Club DJ**: A DJ at a gentleman's club can gross around $65,000 per year working three nights a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Freelance Video Editor**: Income can fluctuate significantly, from $40,000-$50,000 in a bad year to $95,000-$110,000 in a solid year, reflecting the "gig work" nature of the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Street Magician**: Earnings are highly dependent on location and season, ranging from $300 to $3,000 per week. In a good location and season, a street magician could easily bring in six figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Aircraft Cleaner**: Earning $17 an hour, the main perk of this job is free flights, which can be a "golden handcuff" for those in lower-paying airline positions, offering significant travel benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Nightclub Director (Vegas)**: This position can be very lucrative, with a reported $100,000 base, a $100,000 tip pool, and a $150,000 performance bonus, plus other perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

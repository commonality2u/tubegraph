Enthusiasm is a crucial factor in interview success, often overlooked by candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Interviewers, including recruiters and hiring managers, seek candidates who demonstrate genuine interest and energy for the role and the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Why Enthusiasm Matters

A lack of enthusiasm or low energy can lead an interviewer to believe that a candidate does not truly want the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Hiring managers prefer team members who are energetic and excited about opportunities, as this positivity can be infectious within a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. They aim to surround themselves with positive, upbeat individuals who are ready to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Practicing Enthusiasm

For individuals who are introverted or for whom enthusiasm does not come naturally, it is advisable to practice displaying higher energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Practicing in front of a mirror can help in working on and improving one's energy during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

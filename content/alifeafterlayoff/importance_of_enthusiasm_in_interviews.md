Enthusiasm is a crucial factor in [[improving_job_interview_performance | improving job interview performance]] and is considered a key element by hiring managers. A lack of enthusiasm is identified as a common mistake candidates make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Why Enthusiasm Matters

*   **Signals Interest** If a candidate appears to have low energy and shows no enthusiasm, it can give the impression that they do not genuinely want the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Team Preference** Hiring managers generally prefer candidates who are energetic and excited about the opportunity over those who come across as bored or uninterested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Infectious Quality** Enthusiasm is sought after by hiring managers because it is considered infectious and can positively influence team dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Employers want team members who are positive, upbeat, and ready to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Cultivating Enthusiasm

Candidates who are passionate about their career should be selective in the roles they accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Asking relevant questions about the role's contribution to department success, specific objectives, or company culture can also demonstrate engagement and impress hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Career Success
To overcome these perceived challenges and succeed, Gen Z should focus on:

### Gaining Practical Experience
*   **Internship Experience** Recruiters actively seek candidates with internship experience, making it a critical component for entry-level positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. It is recommended to participate in as many internship programs as possible, as early as possible in a degree program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Professional Conduct
*   **Appropriate Social Media Use** Be mindful of public social media presence, as employers often check it before hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Avoid posting content that brags about slacking off or unprofessional behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. It's important to differentiate personal life from professional life and not share every detail online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Political Discussions** Refrain from discussing political topics at work, as it can lead to negative consequences, including termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Limiting Phone Use** Constant phone use, especially for non-work-related activities like scrolling on TikTok, can lead to disciplinary action and termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Employees are expected to focus on work and avoid excessive distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Understanding and Mirroring Workplace Norms** When unsure about flexible arrangements (e.g., start times), it's advisable to seek clear feedback from management and observe and mirror the behavior of co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Going "rogue" can create a negative impression, especially early in tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Taking Responsibility** Acknowledge mistakes and take responsibility for actions, such as tardiness or no-call, no-shows, rather than offering excuses or expressing disbelief at consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Active Engagement** Avoid "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place" where minimal work is done. Employers are less tolerant of this behavior in today's competitive job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## Outlook for Gen Z
While perceptions exist about some Gen Z workers, it's acknowledged that these are often "a few bad apples" and many Gen Z individuals are highly motivated, driven, and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Gen Z should focus on fundamental good employee practices, as every generation has faced similar criticisms upon entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

Gen Z is also recognized for driving positive change in the workplace, particularly advocating for a better work-life balance, which is seen as a welcome development given the historical imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. By focusing on [[Strategies for job seekers to gain a competitive edge | professionalism]], responsibility, and skill development, Gen Z can contribute positively and achieve [[Strategies for career resilience and stability | career resilience and stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

[[importance_of_interview_preparation | Interview preparation]] is crucial for successfully navigating job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A key aspect of effective [[interview_preparation_and_selfpresentation | self-presentation]] in interviews is to adopt a storytelling approach, as hiring managers prefer candidates who can convey their experiences and skills through engaging narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The better the storyteller, the more likely you are to impress the interviewer and secure an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The STAR Methodology

A widely recommended method for structuring answers to interview questions is the STAR methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. STAR stands for:
*   **S** - **Situation**: Set the scene by providing context, like introducing the "hero" (you) into the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **T** - **Task**: Describe what needed to be accomplished, or the "mission" the hero was undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **A** - **Action**: Detail the specific actions you took to complete the task and accomplish the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **R** - **Result**: Conclude with the outcome or "happily ever after," explaining what happened as a result of your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Keeping the STAR methodology in mind during [[strategies_for_preparing_for_job_interviews | interview preparation]] is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## [[essential_questions_to_ask_during_an_interview | Essential Questions to Prepare For]]

It is strongly recommended to prepare answers for commonly asked questions prior to your interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While this is not an all-encompassing list, here are several major questions you should be ready to answer:

### "Tell me about yourself"

This question is almost guaranteed in nearly every interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Interviewer's Goal**: They want you to provide context on why you are suited for the role, beyond what's on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They know you have a base level of competency or you wouldn't be there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Use this as an opportunity to elaborate on your background, adding "flavor" or "color commentary," and highlighting why you are the best fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Avoid discussing non-related hobbies, family details, or irrelevant past trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Key**: Ensure everything you share is calculated to show you are the best possible candidate for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Have an end point in mind to avoid rambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### "Why do you want to work here?" or "Why should we hire you?"

These questions assess your genuine interest in the company and the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Interviewer's Goal**: To see if you have legitimate reasons for your interest, beyond just "spraying and praying" applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Be honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Connect the job to your career path, ensuring it fits nicely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Make sure your motivation is sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> and related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Highlight something unique about the company that differentiates you, showing genuine excitement for the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### "What's your greatest weakness?"

This can be a tricky question, as no one likes to admit weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Interviewer's Goal**: To gauge self-awareness and how you handle challenges. They can see through generic answers like "I'm too detail-oriented" or "I care too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Be authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Pick a real weakness that won't paint you in a bad light for the specific job (e.g., don't say you're bad with numbers for an accounting role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Explain the impact of this weakness and, most importantly, provide a solid example of how you learned from it and are working to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This approach solidifies you as a top candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### "What's your greatest strength?"

This is the flip side of the weakness question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Pull from the job posting to ensure your strength is work-related and relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Focus on a strength that is most important for success in that particular job's competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Be honest and provide a great example using the STAR Format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### "What's your greatest professional accomplishment?"

Companies prefer to hire high-achievers, especially in areas relevant to the work they are hiring for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Strategically think about the biggest accomplishment that is related to the job you're applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Provide a STAR-formatted example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### "What are your salary expectations?"

This question often comes up during the preliminary interview with a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Importance**: The number you give here can influence subsequent negotiations, so strategic thinking is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Salary transparency laws may exist, but published ranges can be abnormally wide and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Strategy**:
    1.  **Research**: Conduct thorough salary research *before* the interview to know your minimum acceptable salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    2.  **Redirect**: When asked, try to put the ball back in their court first by asking if they are willing to share their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    3.  **Provide a Range**: If they push back, state a range based on other opportunities you're considering. For example: "Other opportunities that I'm considering are paying between \[minimum acceptable salary] and \[minimum + 20%] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>."
    4.  **Avoid Previous Salary**: Do not answer with your previous salary or just what you would like to make. A range provides wiggle room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### "Do you have any questions for us?"

This question is typically asked at the end of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Be prepared with your own [[asking_questions_to_interviewers | questions to ask the interviewers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. It's ideal to get some job-related questions answered earlier in the interview process to use that information to your advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. At the end, this is an opportunity to inquire about the job, working conditions, hours, shifts, or even circle back to salary expectations if not covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## General Preparation Tips

*   **Write Down Answers**: It's advisable to write down your answers to commonly asked questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Comfort, Not Rehearsal**: Be comfortable with your answers, but avoid rehearsing them so closely that you sound robotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Internalize**: Internalize the answers to the point where you can recite them seamlessly and effortlessly, making them sound like normal conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

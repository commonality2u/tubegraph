Human Resources (HR) is a hotly debated subject, and understanding its true function can dispel many common misconceptions. The speaker, with 20 years of experience in HR management and recruiting for various companies, aims to provide an insider's perspective on the "ugly truth" about HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Common Perceptions vs. Reality
Many employees feel bitterness and anger towards HR, often believing that HR is supposed to be on their side and act as an advocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While at a fundamental level this is true, there's a broader perspective to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The speaker, despite having worked in the field, doesn't agree with everything HR does and identifies as an employee advocate when the employee is acting properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### The Misconception of HR as Your Friend
There's a common misconception that HR is your friend, someone you can confide in about your issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While many HR professionals are compassionate and believe in doing the right thing, there's a deeper layer to their function that employees should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### When to Engage HR Strategically
It's important to think strategically before engaging HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Legal Issues:** If you are experiencing legal issues like harassment or illegal activities, you **should** go to HR. Reporting these sensitive situations protects you and the company from bigger problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Performance/Personality Conflicts:** For issues like performance problems, conflicts with your boss, or general complaints, it's advisable to try and resolve them at your level first, without HR involvement, if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Administrative Issues:** For issues related to benefits, paychecks, or policy interpretation, contacting HR is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Avoid Venting
>When you speak to HR, they are listening for potential legal risks and corporate liabilities. If you say something that indicates a risk, they are required to escalate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Venting to HR is generally not recommended, as they will assess your statements from a corporate risk perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## The True Function of Human Resources
At its core, HR is a business department, not a department primarily for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The speaker personally dislikes the term "human resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Hierarchical Purpose of HR
The functions of HR can be understood in a hierarchy:

1.  **Primary Purpose: Risk Mitigation & Compliance**
    HR's ultimate driving mission is to [[shady_practices_of_hr_departments | mitigate risk]], implement risk avoidance, and ensure compliance with legal requirements to keep the company out of legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

2.  **Next Tier: Strategic Alignment**
    HR acts as a strategic business partner to senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. They align talent with the overall business strategy to ensure the company has the right people to achieve its executive goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

    >[!NOTE] [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | Layoffs]] and Adverse Decisions
    >This strategic alignment is often where [[human_resource_practices_in_layoffs | layoffs]] and adverse employment decisions occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. If an employee's position or contributions no longer align with the company's strategic direction, they may be let go, even if they are a capable employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. HR, in these cases, delivers the bad news, which can appear cold and calculated because it is a business decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Workforce planning involves reviewing people as data points and numbers on spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

3.  **Final Purpose: Talent Management (Traditional HR)**
    This tier encompasses what most people traditionally associate with HR: attracting, developing, and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This includes recruitment, establishing business practices, and benefits administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. More compassionate HR professionals are typically found at these lower, employee-facing levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### Historical Context
HR departments, originally called "personnel departments," formed 80 to 100 years ago during the Industrial Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Their purpose was to staff large corporations and ensure the business had the resources needed to produce products, not to advocate for individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## Taking Ownership of Your Career
Many people become frustrated and [[emotional_impact_of_hr_decisions_on_employees | bitter]] towards HR because they've experienced adverse employment decisions and haven't fully processed or taken ownership of their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While some HR individuals may indeed be "cold or calculated," employees often contribute to the situations that lead to their negative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of taking ownership of one's career, viewing oneself as a "free agent," and not allowing organizations to steer one's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Trusting a company to always do the right thing for an individual employee can lead to disappointment, as companies prioritize their best business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. By owning and strategically directing your career, adverse situations become less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

[[employer_recruitment_practices_and_ghost_jobs | Employment ghosting]] is a common and frustrating experience for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It occurs when an employer or company representative initiates a formalized interviewing process with a candidate and then fails to provide updates on the application's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This differs from simply not receiving a response after an initial job application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The process often begins with applying for a job or being contacted by a recruiter, leading to excitement about an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. After preparing for and conducting interviews, sometimes even multiple rounds, candidates are told, "we'll get back to you shortly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Weeks or even months can pass without communication, leading the candidate to realize they have likely been ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This is considered poor candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Common Reasons for Employment Ghosting

Several factors contribute to why employers ghost candidates:

### Lazy Recruiting or Recruiters
This is often cited as the most common reason for ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Recruiters may be too busy or simply lack the effort to follow up and close the loop on an interview process they initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Disorganized recruiters or those who don't prioritize candidate experience may forget or simply not care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This reflects poorly on the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Bad Work Processes
Companies lacking internal controls often struggle with effective recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This is particularly true for companies without a formalized talent acquisition department within their human resources division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Without established best practices in recruiting, candidate experience can suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Additionally, outdated or inefficient software that cannot handle the volume of applicants can contribute to increased ghosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Overloaded Recruiters
A professional recruiter should ideally manage between 15 to 25 requisitions (jobs they are recruiting for), depending on the industry, roles, and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. When recruiters are assigned 40 to 50 requisitions—double a reasonable workload—candidate experience inevitably suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Given that recruiters are often graded on sending three interviewable candidates per job, an overloaded recruiter might be dealing with 200 or more candidates at any given time, making it easy for some to "fall through the cracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Recruiter Forgot
While not an excuse for poor candidate experience, a recruiter might simply forget to follow up, especially when managing a large volume of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. A lack of proper tools or processes to track candidates can exacerbate this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Hiring Manager Indecisiveness or Delays
This is a frequent scenario that can lead to the perception of ghosting, even if the candidate hasn't been officially rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Hiring managers may take a long time to review candidates or request to see additional slates of candidates before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This can delay the hiring process by weeks, making early candidates feel ghosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Recruiters often push back on indecisive hiring managers to ensure timely candidate disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. [[reasons_job_offers_are_delayed | Hiring manager delays]] in getting back to the recruiter also contribute to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Position Placed on Hold, Re-scoped, or Closed
A job position might be placed on hold or re-scoped in the middle of the recruitment process, even with active candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Hiring managers sometimes request that current candidates be kept "lukewarm" while they seek a different level of candidate or re-evaluate the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This situation is frustrating for recruiters as there's no good way to convey to a candidate that they are liked but not enough for an immediate decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. If a requisition is simply closed, recruiters do not always follow up with all remaining in-process candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Another Candidate Was Hired
In some cases, a company hires another candidate, and the recruiter closes the requisition without following up with the other candidates who were in process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This is a symptom of poor work processes or bad recruiting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Impact on Employer Brand
Companies should prioritize candidate experience because it directly impacts their employment brand and potentially their bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, Amazon holds its recruiters to strict metrics on candidate experience, including a "two and five promise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This promise ensures a two-day turnaround for updates after a hiring manager phone screen and a five-day turnaround after an on-site interview loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This forces efficiency and decisiveness in hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The philosophy behind this is that many job seekers are also customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Poor treatment during an interview process could lead to a candidate choosing not to do business with the company as a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Recruiters and CEOs are encouraged to consider how they would treat a customer across the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## What Candidates Can Do
If a candidate suspects they have been ghosted by an employer, there isn't much they can do beyond sending a polite "nudge" to the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This simple follow-up often prompts the recruiter to check on the application status and provide an update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

When interviewing for a new position, it is crucial for candidates to understand the criteria for success within the role. Asking specific questions can help a job seeker [[evaluating_the_company_and_role_as_a_candidate | screen the company]] and determine if the expectations are reasonable and if they are set up for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience emphasizes that the best candidates often feel like they are interviewing the company as much as they are being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Assessing Expectations

One key question to ask is:
*   **"How do you measure success in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>

This question helps ensure that the expectations for the role are reasonable and feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. If the hiring manager's expectations seem misaligned with the realities of the position, it provides an opportunity for the candidate to push back and seek clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Understanding these initial benchmarks is vital for assessing whether the role will be a good cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Entering a role with unreasonable expectations can lead to being set up for failure and quick turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Learning from Past Success

If the role was previously held by someone who was promoted or moved to other opportunities, a valuable question to ask is:
*   **"What is it about that person that made them so successful in this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>

Listening closely to the hiring manager's answer will provide insights into the specific actions and qualities needed to succeed in that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. This information can serve as a roadmap for success if the candidate lands the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

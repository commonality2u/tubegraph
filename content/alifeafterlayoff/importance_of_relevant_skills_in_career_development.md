While being exceptionally good at a specific task can provide a competitive advantage in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, it's crucial to understand that relevant skills hold greater importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## The Ephemeral Nature of Employer Value
Employers value a certain skill until they no longer do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. You might be retrained on a specific skill because of an immediate need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, but once that need diminishes, your relevance with those skills can disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## The Risk of Niche Skills
A skill highly valued within one organization or industry may not be valued similarly elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This can lead to a situation where your resume is filled with skills that no longer appeal to other employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Consequences of Irrelevant Skills
When your skills become irrelevant, you may find yourself stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, panicking, and potentially settling for jobs that are below your true potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A single low-quality job can unfortunately lead to a succession of similar roles, creating significant issues on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Furthermore, if employers don't foresee your skills contributing in the future, despite past achievements, you may face unfortunate outcomes like layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Focus on Broadly Relevant Skills
The key to avoiding these pitfalls is to focus on relevant skills that are highly in demand by multiple employers, not just your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Developing these broadly applicable skills is a core component of effective [[career_management_and_development | career management and development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Proactive Career Management
To ensure continuous relevance, you must act as the CEO of your career, which includes developing all necessary "hats" or skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This approach allows you to take ownership and approach your career with more [[strategies_for_effective_career_management | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

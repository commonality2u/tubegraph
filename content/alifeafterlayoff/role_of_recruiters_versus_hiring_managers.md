The job market can often feel out of touch, with employer requirements seeming impossible to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This frustration is often due to "hidden job requirements" that are not publicly advertised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. An accidental leak of internal selection guidelines revealed the stark differences between what is publicly posted and what companies are truly looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### The Role of the Hiring Manager

The "secret internal selection guidelines" are typically provided by the hiring authorities, usually the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The hiring manager creates a list of "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These "must-haves" are generally obvious, like total years of experience or core skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. However, the "prefers" list is where personal "hiring manager bias" often comes into play, making requirements less realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Job seekers often mistakenly attribute this bias to [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search|recruiters]], but it frequently originates from the hiring manager or their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### The Role of the Recruiter

[[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search|Recruiters]] receive these detailed requirements, often during an "intake call" with the hiring manager when a job requisition is opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Both internal corporate [[differences_between_corporate_recruiters_and_headhunters|recruiters]] and third-party headhunters receive these same guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

A good [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search|recruiter]] should challenge unrealistic demands from the hiring manager, explaining that such strict criteria will "eliminate a lot of good candidates" and are "not realistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, this pushback often doesn't happen, especially if the [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search|recruiter]] is junior or lacks deep market knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Once the [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search|recruiter]] has these requirements, they then "go to market" to find candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Examples of Hidden Requirements and Biases

An accidentally leaked internal memo for a software development role revealed extreme hidden requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These serve as a powerful example of the biases held by some hiring managers:

*   **Educational Background**:
    *   University graduate with a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science from a "top program" like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, or University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   A special exception might be made for a 4.0 graduate from other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Years of Experience**:
    *   Strictly 4 to 10 years of software development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. A "genius" with only two years of experience would not be a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Technical Expertise**:
    *   Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS), sometimes modern tech like Kotlin, and knowledge of AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Role**:
    *   Candidates must have 2+ years in each role; "job hoppers" are not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Even if a job loss was due to a company closing or layoffs, it would negatively impact a candidate's fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Company Experience**:
    *   Significant experience in "notable startups" backed by firms like Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   Clients will "not hire anybody who's worked for large companies only," even if it was Google or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Such candidates are believed not to "understand how it is to code in a startup organization" and will be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Diversity and Background**:
    *   Diversity hires (e.g., Black, female) are a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   Must be a US citizen, permanent resident, green card holder, or Canadian citizen; no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. (This specific requirement is noted as fairly common) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Bonus points for being a "founding engineer" or having "founder experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### What Hiring Managers Want to Avoid (Red Flags)

The memo also detailed specific candidate profiles that hiring managers want to avoid:

*   **Visa candidates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Career contractors** (seeking permanent employees only) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Job hoppers** (frequent short stints) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Graduates of coding bootcamps** (e.g., Full Stack Academy, Hacked Reactor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Consulting background** (prefer candidates who produced products directly at a company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Experience limited to big companies only** (e.g., Uber, Intel) unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Fake profiles/scam profiles** (a general concern in the IT world) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Candidates who have ever worked at specific "blacklisted" companies** like Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Impact and Advice for Job Seekers

Job seekers are justified in their frustration with these "ridiculous" and often "hidden" requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Such extensive wish lists make the [[effects_of_overloaded_recruiters_on_job_applicants|recruiter's job]] significantly more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While the leaked list is extreme, it's acknowledged that this scenario is "not that far off from reality" for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

The advice for job seekers is to recognize that "it's them and not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Focus on presenting a clean, direct resume, engaging in targeted networking, and creating portfolios or simple websites to showcase skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:13:08]</a>. It's important not to lose sleep over unrealistic hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Some companies will struggle to find qualified candidates due to their impossible demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The best strategy is to avoid applying for jobs with such high-friction requirements, as this can force companies to adjust their hiring approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:45]</a>. Reclaiming control in one's career involves not subjecting oneself to these types of restrictive rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

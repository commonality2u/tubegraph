## Workplace Culture and Preparation Gaps

There appears to be a significant cultural disconnect between what universities are preparing students for and the realities of the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Employers feel that new graduates are unprepared, and there isn't enough transition training to acclimate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Case Studies from TikTok

Examples from social media illustrate some of these reported issues:

*   **First Case:** A Gen Z individual recounts being fired from two accounting roles within the same year. The first firing was due to being on her phone constantly because the role was "boring," and the company culture had "snitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Her desk was even moved in front of her manager's to monitor her phone usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The second firing was due to an "All-Star employee" reporting her for coming in "whenever she felt like it" despite her contract allowing flexible hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. She ultimately learned responsibility and found a fulfilling career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Second Case:** An HR representative terminates an employee for consistent tardiness and a "no call, no show" on her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The employee shows a lack of responsibility and does not see an issue with being late or missing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This incident reportedly led the employer to stop hiring new nurse graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Third Case:** An individual boasts about "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place" by doing "nothing for 15 months" until discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This highlights a perceived lack of work ethic that employers are now less willing to tolerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

## Addressing the [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | Challenges of the Current Job Market]]

The speaker acknowledges that Gen Z is entering the workforce during one of the most difficult and "topsy-turvy" job markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Many college graduates are applying to thousands of positions just to begin their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

To improve hireability, employers are looking for Gen Z candidates who demonstrate:
*   Initiative and positive attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   A strong work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   Adaptability and openness to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Punctuality and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Solid technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   [[importance_of_internships_and_work_experience_for_graduates | Internship experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Recruiters prioritize candidates with internship experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Work-appropriate social media presence, as employers do check social media before hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   Avoiding political topics in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

While some Gen Z employees struggle, it's important to note that many are highly motivated, driven, and strategic, indicating that negative perceptions are not a blanket statement for the entire [[generational_differences_in_workplace_expectations_and_adaptations | generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The speaker suggests that Gen Z should be given some grace, as they are also driving positive changes in the workplace, such as a greater emphasis on work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

In a notable trend, bosses are increasingly terminating Gen Z workers, with a significant number of recent college graduates being fired in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This highlights a clear disconnect between [[employer_expectations_vs_reality | employer expectations]] and the realities observed in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Survey Findings on Recent College Graduate Hires

A survey conducted by intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders involved in hiring decisions, revealed concerning attitudes towards recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
While 75% of companies reported hiring Gen Z, a striking 6 out of 10 admitted to firing a recent college graduate within the same year of their hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Overall, 75% of companies reported at least one issue with their recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Employer Perceptions and Beliefs

Hiring managers also hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:
*   **Entitlement**: 65-70% believe they are entitled, often trying to get promoted too quickly without demonstrated experience or demanding high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Impact on Hiring Practices

One in seven companies may not hire any college graduates in 2025, and one out of six hiring managers are already hesitant to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Addressing the Perception of [[generational_perceptions_and_realities_in_the_job_market | Gen Z]]

While it is easy to generalize, it's acknowledged that these issues apply to a "few bad apples" rather than the entire generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Many Gen Z employees are highly motivated, driven, and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. It's important to remember that every generation has faced similar feedback upon entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

Despite the [[current_challenges_in_the_job_market | difficult job market]] Gen Z faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, they are also driving positive [[changing_expectations_in_the_modern_workplace | change]], particularly in advocating for work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

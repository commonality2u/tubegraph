Interviewing for a job can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially when uncertain about the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. As a corporate recruiter, it's possible to identify subtle signs that indicate a strong interest from the hiring team and that a job offer might be forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Signs You're a Top Candidate

### 1. The Company Actively "Keeps You Warm"

If a hiring manager is particularly interested in a candidate, they will often instruct the recruiter to "keep the candidate warm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This means the recruiter will keep you informed about the progress behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

<div class="callout">
  <p>Keeping a candidate "warm" aims to keep them engaged, close to the role, and excited about the opportunity, maintaining the post-interview high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.</p>
</div>

Conversely, if there are long periods with no communication or updates, it might indicate that you are not considered a top candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. In such cases, the team might be focusing on other candidates who are ranked higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Top candidates are actively kept warm and the company seeks to conclude their [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | interview process]] as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### 2. Recruiters Inquire About Other Interviews

A strong sign of interest is when a recruiter asks if you are actively interviewing with other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This question is not malicious; it's an effort to gauge how aggressively the company needs to move you through their [[improving_recruitment_processes | recruitment process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Hiring managers often have complex schedules or need to wait for key decision-makers, which can slow down the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Knowing about other interviews or offers allows the recruiter to accelerate their internal timeline, potentially skipping steps or interviewers to get you through quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. If you have an offer with a tight deadline, informing the recruiter can prompt the hiring team to expedite their decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### 3. Immediate Scheduling of the Next Interview

If, at the conclusion of an interview, the recruiter immediately tries to schedule the next one – either on the spot or shortly after – it's a very strong indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This suggests that the company is [[fasttracking_candidates_in_the_interview_process | fast-tracking you]] through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Being fast-tracked means you've been identified as a strong candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. If they are making significant efforts to arrange an interview with a senior leader, it's an especially positive sign that an offer could be imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Senior leaders are often difficult to schedule, but if they recognize a candidate's high potential, they will clear their schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Conversely, if scheduling for future rounds is constantly delayed or given the "runaround," it may indicate that either the job isn't a high priority, or you are considered a mid-tier candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### 4. Reconfirming Interest and Salary Expectations

After interviews have concluded, if a recruiter calls to reconfirm your interest in the role and your salary expectations, it's a strong positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This usually means the hiring manager has asked the recruiter to assess your current situation and confirm your alignment with the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The reconfirmation of salary expectations is particularly significant, as it indicates they are working on the numbers for a potential offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. They want to ensure the offer will be exciting to you upon presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. When asked, it's important to be realistic and consistent with previous salary discussions, as a large discrepancy could be seen as a red flag and potentially jeopardize the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### 5. Direct Call from the Hiring Manager

A highly positive sign is when the hiring manager calls you directly, rather than the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Recruiters often suggest this to hiring managers for highly desired candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This direct call serves as a "pre-sale" or "pre-close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The manager aims to:
* Reconfirm your interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
* Answer any lingering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
* Get you excited about the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
* Address any potential objections you might have before an offer is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The goal is to streamline the [[improving_job_offer_processes | job offer process]] and avoid lengthy negotiations or rejections after an offer is extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Overall Outlook

If you've been invited to an interview, especially a panel interview, it already indicates that the company sees you as a good fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The interview itself is your opportunity to demonstrate your suitability for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Observing these signs can help alleviate some of the anxiety associated with the job search and provide confidence as you await a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

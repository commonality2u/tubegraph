Quitting a job right now may not be in one's best interest, largely due to the current state of the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Many individuals seek career coaching due to issues with management, feeling disrespected, being underpaid, or finding their work unfulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, advisors often recommend against quitting unless absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Current State of the Job Market

The job market is currently "not really that good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Many who have quit their jobs are discovering that replacing them is very difficult and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Even marketable individuals with strong backgrounds are finding it hard to get phone calls or first-round interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The job market is extremely competitive, with companies often receiving thousands of candidates for a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This competition is particularly amplified for highly coveted roles like remote or hybrid positions, as companies are becoming less "remote-first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Job seekers are now competing with double or triple the number of applicants compared to just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Comparison to Previous Years

The current job market is vastly different from 2021 and most of 2022, which was considered a "Heyday for job seekers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. During that period, companies were actively recruiting talent and offering high salaries because they couldn't hire fast enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Impact of Industry Shifts

Many people rebranded themselves into technical roles, such as software developers, during the 2021-2022 tech boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, the tech market experienced a significant downturn in late 2022 and into 2023, causing these lucrative job offers to dry up overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This has resulted in a glut of individuals struggling to find jobs in these rebranded fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While the tech industry is the best example, other industries have also been affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Remote Work Mandates and Their Consequences

A significant number of individuals who participated in the "Great Resignation" took remote jobs, expecting them to be their new work-life standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. However, more and more companies are now forcing employees back to the office through remote mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Those who quit their jobs seeking new remote or non-hybrid roles are finding their phones not ringing as frequently as they did a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Economic Cooldown and "Great Regret"

There are increasing signs of an economic cooldown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This has led to fewer lucrative job offers as companies begin to reset salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This situation makes it difficult for individuals hoping to jump ship for a salary increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Many who participated in the "Great Resignation" are now feeling stuck or regretting their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This phenomenon is termed the "Great Regret," where people realize they may have made a significant mistake by quitting their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Strategic Career Management

While it's important not to tolerate poor employers, quitting a job should rarely be the first option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It requires a strategic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### When Quitting Might Be Necessary

In truly toxic situations, where one is asked to do something illegal or unethical, or experiences bonafide harassment or a hostile work environment, it may be advisable to seek a different employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, it's crucial to proceed with "eyes wide open" due to the current [[challenges_in_the_job_market | labor market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Recommendations for Job Seekers

For those who are currently gainfully employed, the recommendation is to "buckle down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Key steps include:

*   **Improve your resume:** Ensure it shines for the open market to compete with thousands of other candidates and get noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Seek the right opportunity:** Don't jump jobs solely for a small salary increase or minor dissatisfaction with a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Prioritize stability:** Over the next few months, finding a job or industry with growth and strength will be paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Acting as the CEO of one's career means making smart, strategic decisions rather than knee-jerk reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Quitting without a clear strategy for landing another job quickly is often not the reality for many people today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Resources for Strategic Job Search

For individuals struggling to find success in the open market, specialized assistance can help navigate employment waters more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This includes:

*   **Strategic resume writing:** Crafting resumes that capture recruiters' attention and generate calls for coveted roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Strategic job search approach:** Developing a plan for the overall job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Interview process navigation:** Guidance through each round of interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Targeted networking:** Leveraging LinkedIn effectively to potentially bypass recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Many people approach their careers without a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. It's recommended not to quit a job until one knows exactly what they are doing and has a framework for making informed career decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

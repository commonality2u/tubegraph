There are two primary types of [[role_of_recruiters_in_job_search | recruiters]] involved in the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:

### Headhunters

*   **Definition**: A headhunter is a third-party entity contracted by a company to fill a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Compensation Structure**: They operate on a contingency basis, meaning they are paid upon successful placement of a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This payment usually amounts to 15% to 25% of the hired candidate's first-year income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Level**: Headhunters typically do not possess the same level of in-depth knowledge about the role or the internal workings of the company as an internal corporate recruiter would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Corporate Recruiters

*   **Definition**: An internal corporate recruiter is a full-time employee of the company, sitting within a talent acquisition department, which may be under the HR umbrella or a standalone department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

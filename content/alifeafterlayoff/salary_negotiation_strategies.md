Questions regarding salary are common in job interviews and can function as a trap if not handled strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Answering improperly can lead to a low offer or a candidate leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, while stating excessively high expectations might deter employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Answering "What's Your Current Salary?"

While some states prohibit this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, it may still arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. If asked, it is advisable to deflect the question and redirect the conversation to the role's value, shifting the focus back to the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Answering "What Are Your Salary Expectations?"

When asked about [[salary_expectations_and_negotiation_in_interviews | salary expectations]], it's important to answer strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Recommended Approach
1.  **Ask them first**: Start by inquiring if the employer is willing to share their salary range for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
2.  **Provide a range**: If the employer insists that you provide a number first, offer a range that includes your minimum acceptable salary plus an additional 10% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   Your "minimum acceptable salary" is the lowest amount that would make you feel positive about the job offer and not immediately continue your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Key Considerations
*   **Research**: Conduct thorough [[salary_negotiations_and_market_surveys | salary research]] before the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Realism**: Be realistic about your true skills and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Control**: Candidates should maintain control over their worth and not allow a company to dictate their salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Willingness to walk away**: Be prepared to decline an offer if the company attempts to lowball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Avoid prolonged avoidance**: Kicking the can down the road by continuously avoiding the question will likely result in the employer placing you in a rejected status or limbo until a number is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Employers typically avoid advancing candidates to interviews with hiring teams and executives if salary expectations are significantly misaligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Similarly, it is a waste of your time to go through a full interview process only to find out the company's expectation is 20-40% lower than yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

By following these [[strategies_for_handling_salary_discussions_during_job_interviews | strategies for handling salary discussions]] and preparing adequately, candidates can approach [[negotiating_salary_expectations_with_employers | salary negotiations]] with greater confidence and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

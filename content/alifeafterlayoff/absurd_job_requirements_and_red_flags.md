This article highlights some of the most absurd and ridiculous job requirements and [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] found in job postings, as observed from scouring the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While presented with a "tongue-in-cheek" approach, the aim is to help job seekers recognize [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flags in job opportunities]] and value themselves to avoid applying for undesirable positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Examples of Absurd Job Requirements and Red Flags

### Accounting Role with Sub-Minimum Wage Pay
An accounting role advertised as remote offers $1,400 a month, which breaks down to $8.75 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Minimum Requirements**: Two years of accounting experience with US-based businesses and a Bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Problem**: This pay rate is below minimum wage in some places and significantly below the expected salary for someone with a degree and two years of experience in accounting, which should be around $45,000-$50,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This is an example of a [[cringeworthy_job_postings | cringeworthy job posting]] and highlights [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | challenges with unrealistic employer demands]] regarding compensation.

### Employee Handbook with Exit Fees
An employee handbook from a restaurant outlines a series of charges against an employee's final pay if they leave the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Charges include**:
    *   Handbook fee ($10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
    *   Training manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
    *   File processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
    *   Payroll processing fee (to get paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
    *   W-2 processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
    *   Uniform costs (t-shirt $12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
    *   Training costs ($25 a day reimbursement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
    *   Hiring processing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   **Problem**: This is an unheard-of practice and a strong [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flag]] indicating an anti-employee culture, likely from a small mom-and-pop operation lacking HR guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Rejection for Being On-Time to an Interview
A job seeker was rejected for a full-time position because they arrived *exactly* on time for their interview instead of earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Reason for Rejection**: The recruiter stated, "we would not consider an employee in a full-time capacity that arrives to an interview exactly on time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Problem**: This is an absolutely ridiculous reason to reject a candidate and indicates an "overly power hungry" recruiter or hiring manager with absurd requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This is a clear [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag in job interviews]].

### Expectation of Unpaid "Test Work" During Interview Process
A hiring manager requested a candidate "come in and work for a couple of hours to see if you like the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. When asked if they would be paid, the manager replied, "no not for that day this is for you to get a feel" and then passive-aggressively ended the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Problem**: Reputable companies do not require unpaid test work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Expecting free labor or intellectual property (like solving a current business case study without compensation) is a significant [[red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flag in job interviews]] and indicative of a toxic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This is also an example of [[overly_demanding_job_application_processes | overly demanding job application processes]].

### Unpaid Senior Marketing Role at a Startup
A job posting for a Marketing Manager/Chief Marketing Officer at a startup explicitly states: "initially, you will work with the founding team as we secure VC funding on a part-time unpaid basis before coming on board full-time as a on a paid basis once we secure funding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Problem**: This is a major [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag in job opportunities]] as it asks for senior-level work without compensation, banking on future funding that may never materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Startups can be [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags]] due to lack of business acumen, funding, and HR structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This is a [[cringeworthy_job_postings | cringeworthy job posting]] and shows a disregard for candidate value.

### Deceitful Salary Ranges in Pay Transparency States
Some companies in pay transparency states (like Colorado, New York City, Connecticut) are posting extremely wide salary ranges to technically comply with the law without actually being transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. One example showed a range of $150,000 to $890,000 for a base salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Problem**: This huge, unrealistic spread (over $700,000) does nothing to help the job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. It indicates shadiness and dishonesty on the part of the employer, suggesting their behavior throughout the hiring process and employment might also be deceitful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This is a [[red_flags_in_job_advertisements | red flag in job advertisements]].

### Website Business Developer & Landscaper Hybrid Role
A part-time position in Calgary, Canada, paying $20-$25 CAD an hour, requires a candidate to be a website business developer, manage website advertising, promote eco-friendly landscaping, and perform up to 50% physical labor for landscaping and snow removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Requirements**: Must be registered with a Canadian post-secondary school and it's an 8-16 week contract position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Problem**: This highly unusual combination of roles (desk work and manual labor) for a student intern is unrealistic and typical of a "mom and pop" operation with [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | unrealistic employer demands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. It's a [[cringeworthy_job_postings | cringeworthy job posting]].

### Impossible Internship Requirements
A four-month student internship starting September 2023 requires:
*   Advanced knowledge of insurance and wealth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>
*   Understanding of advisor compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>
*   Knowledge of internal admin systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>
*   Post-secondary education in a related field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>
*   Professional designations like CPA, CFA, CSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>
*   Advanced analytical skills with Power BI, Microsoft Excel, Tableau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>
*   **Problem**: The employer is expecting "the moon" from a four-month intern, making it an impossible internship to qualify for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This showcases skewed and [[challenges_with_unrealistic_employer_demands_in_job_postings | unrealistic employer demands]] for an entry-level position.

### Request for a Photo of Your Fridge
At the end of a job application, after attaching a resume, the company asks for "a photo of the inside of your fridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **Problem**: This is a bizarre and intrusive requirement, indicating either a recruiter "gone rogue" trying to be "cute" or a hiring manager with completely unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. It's a prime example of an [[overly_demanding_job_application_processes | overly demanding job application process]] and a highly [[cringeworthy_job_postings | cringeworthy job posting]].

## Conclusion
Recognizing these [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_postings | red flags in job postings]] is crucial for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Employers with such absurd requirements are often low-quality or toxic, and working for them will likely hinder career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. In a way, these ridiculous postings do job seekers a favor by clearly indicating employers to avoid, unlike those who hide their toxic nature until it's too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Always value yourself and avoid applying for "garbage" jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

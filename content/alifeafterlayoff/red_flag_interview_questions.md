Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, but certain questions from employers can signal a [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | low-quality opportunity]] or an ulterior motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Being attentive to these "tells" can help you determine if a potential workplace is a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Questions Indicating Potential Issues

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
While this question might seem innocent, especially for hourly employees, it often indicates a company culture that is overly focused on attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. If an employer is highly particular about attendance, it suggests they may have dealt with attendance issues previously, leading to strict policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. This question can also imply they suspect you'll be an attendance problem and that the workplace may lack flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:05">[02:32:05]</a>. If asked, consider asking the interviewer about their expectations for unplanned absences; a response indicating a "cracking down" approach could point to a toxic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
This question directly asks how cheaply an employer can hire you, suggesting little flexibility in compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:44">[03:07:44]</a>. If an employer is already trying to "lowball" you at the outset, it's a [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | strong indicator]] that maintaining a competitive salary or achieving promotions and raises will be a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:15">[03:20:15]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
This question is often a [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag]] for a high turnover issue within the company or specific department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:03">[03:36:03]</a>. It prompts you to question why people are leaving the role quickly enough for the employer to need to assess commitment during an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:25">[03:49:25]</a>. Such a question may be based on an employer's bias or a deeper cultural problem rather than reflecting your potential success in the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:21">[04:01:21]</a>.

### "Have you ever been fired?"
While some individuals may have experienced adverse employment decisions, this question is generally not the employer's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:56">[04:07:56]</a>. Employers should focus on the current job and your ability to perform, as past performance isn't always the best indicator of future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:04">[04:21:04]</a>. Being fired might have been due to a poor situation that shouldn't negatively impact your entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>. If asked, consider redirecting the question to focus on your accomplishments and future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:34">[04:36:34]</a>. If the interviewer probes further or becomes difficult, it may be best to withdraw your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:10">[04:49:10]</a>.

### Accusations of Exaggerating or Embellishing Your Resume
Assuming you haven't exaggerated your resume, an employer accusing you of doing so suggests a lack of trust from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:32">[04:56:32]</a>. This implies they either believe you are lying or assume everyone is, leading to an immediate challenge to your credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:09">[05:10:09]</a>. Such an accusation is a [[signs_of_a_red_flag_job_candidate | sign]] of a toxic employer and likely indicates a negative workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:10">[05:20:10]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
This is often considered a [[trap_job_interview_questions | trap question]] that yields little useful information and can be used against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:14">[05:27:14]</a>. While the intent might be to understand how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase such a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. Focusing on failures can lead to bias against the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:51">[05:41:51]</a>. If you must answer, minimize time discussing the failure itself and focus on how you overcame it and the positive lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:14">[05:53:14]</a>.

### Asking About Off-Shift or Weekend Availability (for a primary shift role)
Common in hourly roles but also seen in salaried positions, this question suggests you'll likely be working overtime, potentially against your will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:45">[06:04:45]</a>. It's a strong indicator that work-life balance may be an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:34">[06:16:34]</a>. If asked, push back to get clear expectations for actual work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:06">[06:26:06]</a>.

### Asking About On-Site Availability for Remote Jobs
If a supposedly remote job interview includes questions about coming into the office regularly, it's likely a hybrid position, not fully remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:48">[06:33:48]</a>. If a "fully remote" job is pitched this way, there's a high chance it will eventually transition to being 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:01">[06:46:01]</a>. This is a significant [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag]] for those seeking truly remote-first roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
This question immediately raises concerns about the workplace environment, suggesting you might be working with difficult or disrespectful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:07">[07:01:07]</a>. If rudeness comes from the manager, it's a major [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag]] to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:47">[07:12:47]</a>. Such a question is a strong indicator of a cultural issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:01">[07:23:01]</a>.

### Interviewer Does Not Provide an Opportunity to Ask Questions
If, at the end of the interview process, the interviewer dominates the conversation and does not allow you to ask your own questions, it is a significant [[red_flags_in_job_opportunities | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:17">[07:30:17]</a>. This shows they may be forgetting that an interview is a two-way street, where you should also be assessing the company and the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:08">[07:43:08]</a>. If they take offense to you asking questions in a professional manner, it suggests they believe they are "above" being assessed, which can indicate a problematic company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:49">[08:02:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Conclusion
> One or two of these questions alone may not definitively mean a company is poor quality, but they serve as valuable data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. It's crucial to ask good probing questions in return to understand the deeper cultural issues before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:05">[08:35:05]</a>.

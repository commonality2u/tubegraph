A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), also known as a Performance Improvement Process, is typically a last resort step taken by Human Resources (HR) for [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]]-related issues with an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. If you find yourself placed on a PIP, it is considered a significant red flag that should be taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## What is a Performance Improvement Plan?

A PIP is a defined period of time with measurable goals that an employee must meet to retain their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The goals set within a PIP are usually very specific and defined to allow for clear measurement of whether they have been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Why is a PIP Used?

From an HR perspective, if a manager seeks to dismiss an employee due to not meeting expectations, HR will typically review the employee's file, including their past [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] appraisals and any documented instances of [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. If a termination appears to be a sudden decision without a documented history of [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] issues, HR professionals aim to limit liability by ensuring there is a paper trail documenting [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. They often push back on managers, asking them to start documenting coaching sessions and reflecting these concerns in [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A PIP is part of establishing this paper trail to defend an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Implications and Outcomes

A PIP has two primary outcomes:

*   **Termination**: If an employee goes through the PIP and does not meet the specified metrics and goals, the end result is typically termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Continued Employment**: If the employee takes the PIP seriously and significantly improves their [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] to meet the defined goals, they can come off the PIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. After coming off a PIP, it becomes the employee's responsibility to continue elevating their [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] to align with their team and move past the period of poor [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## What to Do if You're on a PIP

If you find yourself on a PIP or notice other signs that your job might be at risk, it is crucial to start thinking about your next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. You should either actively work to address your [[performance_and_layoffs | performance]] or consider making a career change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Regardless of your choice, it will require concerted effort and action on your part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The main thing is to take action to either salvage the current situation or "cut bait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

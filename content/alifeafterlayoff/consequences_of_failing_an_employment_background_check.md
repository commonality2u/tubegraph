A job offer is often contingent upon the successful completion of a background check and potentially a drug screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The [[employment_background_check_process | background check process]] is typically outsourced to a third-party company that verifies information on behalf of the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The job application itself is considered a legal document, and applicants often certify that all information provided is correct and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It becomes a permanent part of an individual's employment record once hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## How Discrepancies Lead to Failure

If there is a discrepancy between what you put on your job application and what the background check reveals, you could [[consequences_of_lying_during_the_hiring_process | lose your job offer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The background check report provides a detailed list of verified or unverified information. If an exception is noted, the employer may circle back with the candidate for verification or potentially [[consequences_of_lying_during_the_hiring_process | pull the offer]] immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. It is in the candidate's best interest to respond proactively to help the company verify their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Falsified Employment History
[[employment_verification_in_background_checks | Employment verification]] checks if you actually worked for a company, the dates of employment, and the titles held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Job Titles**: While minor adjustments to job titles to suit an industry might not be a major issue if they are at the same level (e.g., "talent acquisition specialist" versus "recruiter"), changing a title to a completely different level (e.g., claiming to be a "director" when you were an "individual contributor") poses major problems and is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Dates of Employment**: Fudging employment dates to give yourself extra work experience can also lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Fabricated Employment**: Trying to have a friend or relative act as an [[employment_verification_in_background_checks | employment verifier]] is a significant risk that can lead to an offer being rescinded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Undisclosed Criminal Background
[[criminal_background_checks_and_their_importance | Criminal background checks]] typically look for felonies and misdemeanors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   A felony conviction is much more serious and can be a barrier to entry for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Misdemeanors are less serious, but their impact depends on the conviction and is handled on a case-by-case basis by the HR department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   Active warrants can also be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   It is always better to disclose a criminal background at the time of the offer to avoid surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Unverified Education or Certifications
Education verification confirms that you attended the claimed school, obtained the stated degree, or hold the claimed certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For example, claiming to be a certified public accountant without holding a CPA license will be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Long-Term Impact of Dishonesty
The job application is a legal document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If an employer discovers that you lied about your credentials, even after you are hired, you can be terminated for cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to be honest and forthcoming with your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> to avoid [[risks_of_falsifying_information_on_job_applications | risks of falsifying information on job applications]].

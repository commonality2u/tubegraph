To effectively navigate modern employment and achieve [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career advancement]], individuals should adopt a self-interested approach, acting as "free agents" or the "CEO of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. This means prioritizing one's own best interests, as nobody else will consistently do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:27">[07:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:29">[10:34:29]</a>.

## Why Self-Interest is Crucial
The contemporary labor market, especially since late 2022 and into 2023, has shown a definitive softening, with widespread layoffs across industries, particularly in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. Companies have exhibited poor behavior in how they handle employment and layoffs, often failing to treat employees with dignity and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a>.

### Examples of Poor Corporate Behavior
*   **Google Layoff** One individual who had worked for Google for over 10 years, and was forced to return to the office, discovered their layoff when their badge no longer worked to enter the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:29">[02:32:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:29">[02:51:29]</a>. There was no prior email or call from a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:29">[03:01:29]</a>.
*   **Layoffs During Business Trips** Some employees were notified of their layoff while in the middle of company business trips, leaving them stranded and without a job away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:29">[03:24:29]</a>.
*   **Layoffs During Personal Crises** One reported instance involved a person being laid off while in labor, about to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:29">[03:48:29]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Employment** An individual who left their previous company to join Google was laid off after only 13 weeks, disrupting their [[career_management_and_development | career path]] without accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:29">[03:56:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:29">[04:02:29]</a>.
*   **Reckless Hiring and Layoffs** Companies have been observed hiring recklessly during boom times, then laying off staff and re-posting the same jobs shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:29">[03:34:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:29">[06:28:29]</a>. An example is Zillow laying off recruiting staff and then posting the same positions a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:29">[06:28:29]</a>.

### Death of Corporate Loyalty
[[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | Corporate loyalty]] is largely considered dead, having declined significantly since the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:29">[07:34:29]</a>. The era of working for decades at one company, collecting a pension, and retiring is largely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:29">[07:38:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:29">[07:44:29]</a>. Companies today often operate on an "instant gratification" or "what have you done for me lately" basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:29">[08:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:29">[08:06:29]</a>.

Companies view employees as "human resources," a number on a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:29">[10:41:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:29">[10:50:29]</a>. As long as an individual is useful, they have a job; the moment they are not, their position may be eliminated without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:29">[10:54:29]</a>.

## Acting Like a Free Agent: Practical Implications
Acting like a free agent involves continuously assessing and making decisions that serve your own interests and [[proactive_career_management_strategies | career goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:29">[08:24:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:29">[10:17:29]</a>.

### Maximizing Opportunity and Earnings
*   **Pursue Higher Earnings** Individuals should not feel bad for seeking out and accepting the highest possible compensation for their skills, even from large, well-paying companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:29">[05:09:29]</a>.
*   **Continue Interviewing** Even after accepting a job offer or starting a new role, it is advisable to continue with other interview processes if better opportunities might arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:26">[09:24:26]</a>. This can lead to significantly higher compensation, as exemplified by a person who secured a job with nearly $100,000 more than their original employment just weeks after being laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:29">[09:43:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:29">[09:51:29]</a>.

### [[Strategies for effective career management | Proactive Career Management]]
To act as a free agent and ensure continuous [[career_strategy_and_coaching | career progression]], individuals should:
*   **Optimize Job Search Tools** Maintain an updated resume and a clean LinkedIn profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:27">[08:42:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:29">[11:54:29]</a>.
*   **Effective Networking** Learn to approach [[the_role_of_networking_and_selfpromotion_in_career_advancement | networking]] effectively to bypass traditional recruitment processes and jump to the front of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:29">[08:48:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:29">[12:50:29]</a>.
*   **Strategic Company Selection** When interviewing, assess how companies have behaved in the past, especially during market downturns, to ensure alignment with organizational values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:29">[06:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:29">[11:46:29]</a>.

One notable instance of a significant mixup between a company and a former employee involves a man, identified by his Twitter handle "firr," who was set up for an interview with the very company that had fired him just two weeks prior, for the exact same position he previously held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This situation became a public spectacle as the individual documented his entire experience on Twitter in a play-by-play format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The "Firr" Incident

Upon being contacted by a recruiter for the interview, the man, having secured other freelance work and interviews, decided to "have a little bit of fun" with the unexpected opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His approach to the interview included:
*   **Disguise and Attire** The individual debated wearing a top hat and a mustache or his old work uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He ultimately decided to wear his old uniform along with a fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. He was later asked to put on a face mask, covering his mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **On-site Interview** The interview was scheduled to be on-site at the company's premises, in a different building from where he previously worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Company's Lack of Awareness** The front desk seemed "unfazed" by his appearance, despite having likely witnessed his escort out of the building after his termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. His phone was still connected to the company's Wi-Fi network, suggesting a lapse in their security protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **The Hiring Manager** The hiring manager for the role was someone the candidate had not met before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This manager was not technical enough to ask hard questions about the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The manager was notably generous, providing the candidate with water, snacks, gummy bears, pretzels, and beef jerky throughout the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Meeting an Engineer** An engineer was brought in to conduct a more technical interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This engineer vaguely recognized the candidate, asking if he had "freelanced here before," to which the candidate truthfully replied he freelanced in many places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **The Revelation** It took at least two full interviews and several hours for the company to realize they were interviewing the same person they had fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. When the hiring manager discovered this, they became "furious" that the candidate had not disclosed his previous termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The candidate offered the manager a gummy bear, which was politely declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. It is assumed the candidate was then asked to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Implications for Hiring Processes

This incident highlights several significant issues within the hiring practices and internal communications of companies, particularly related to [[common_mistakes_in_the_hiring_process | Common mistakes in the hiring process]] and [[job_interview_mishaps | Job interview mishaps]].
*   **Lack of Internal Communication** The fact that a recruiter contacted a recently terminated employee for the same position, and that multiple interviewers, including a hiring manager, failed to recognize him or his name, indicates a severe disconnect in internal company records and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is especially jarring given the short two-week period between the firing and the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Screening** The recruiter's failure to identify the candidate as a recently fired employee suggests inadequate screening processes or a lack of access to crucial internal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Disconnected Management** The hiring manager's lack of technical knowledge for the role and inability to recognize an employee who was recently terminated from their team demonstrates a significant detachment from the workforce they oversee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Accountability** The hiring manager's anger at the candidate for not disclosing his previous termination, despite the company initiating the interview, underscores a misplaced sense of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

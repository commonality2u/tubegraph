When you're unhappy at work and explore new opportunities, landing an offer can cause your current company to scramble and present a counter offer, promising a new title and bigger compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises never to accept a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## High Likelihood of Departure

Statistics indicate that accepting a counter offer is often a temporary solution. According to LinkedIn, over 80% of individuals who accept a counter offer are no longer with their company after six months, and a staggering 93% have left within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The recruiter's personal experience corroborates this, as candidates who accepted counters often reach back out within a year, seeking a new position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Underlying Issues Persist

One of the primary [[Reasons to decline a counter offer from your employer | reasons to decline a counter offer]] is that the initial motivations for seeking new employment will likely remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If you were looking to leave due to a bad boss, poor company culture, work-life balance issues, a difficult commute, or terrible benefits, these problems will likely continue to exist even after accepting a counter offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Selfishness and Career Focus

You should prioritize your career and be "selfish" in your decisions, as companies may lay off long-tenured employees without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Leaving a negative environment, such as a bad boss, a poor work culture, or a declining industry, is not only the right choice but also the smart one for your career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Undervaluation and Lack of Proactivity

Ask yourself why your current employer is only countering now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. They were essentially undervaluing you until you decided or threatened to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This suggests they either took you for granted or were caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Often, a counter offer is a tactic to buy them time to find your replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Damaged Relationships and Trust

Accepting a counter offer can change your relationships at work. Your employer will know you intended to leave and will likely begin searching for your replacement or putting a contingency plan in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. You may have effectively made yourself redundant by broadcasting your intent to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Increased Risk of Future Layoffs

Because you've shown dissatisfaction, you may be labeled as not long-term committed to the company's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. If the company faces financial difficulties, you might be among the first considered for layoffs, especially if your new counter-offered salary is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Impact on Long-Term Career Prospects

Even if a promotion or expanded responsibilities are promised, [[Impact of accepting a counter offer on career progression | consider the impact on your long-term career progression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Senior leaders may view you as less dedicated and pass you over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Often, the promised role is merely to keep you satisfied temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The "Honeymoon Period" Fades

While workplace conditions might improve for a short "honeymoon period" after accepting a counter offer, it will eventually wear off, and you will likely face the same issues that motivated your job search in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Even if you're promoted with a new boss, you'll still work alongside the old boss whom you effectively threatened to quit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Analogy of an Old Relationship

The decision to accept a counter offer can be compared to an old relationship: "look back on it fondly but remember that it ended for a reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It's often best to look forward to new beginnings for the sake of your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

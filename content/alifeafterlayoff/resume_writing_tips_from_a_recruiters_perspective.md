A recruiter and career coach, Brian from Life After Layoff, shares insights on how to improve resumes, emphasizing that while there's no single "right" way, effective resumes yield desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His approach is based on a corporate recruiter's perspective, including how resumes are quickly screened (often a 5-second glance) and feedback from hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The ultimate goal of these [[strategic_resume_writing_and_optimization_for_job_seekers | strategic resume writing]] tips is to capture attention quickly and secure that crucial first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Template and Formatting Recommendations

When considering [[improving_resume_format_for_applicant_tracking_systems | improving resume format]], it's important to make choices that aid readability and compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

*   **Avoid Outdated or Graphic-Heavy Templates**: Refrain from using templates designed by graphic designers, often found on sites like Canva.com or large resume hubs, that feature numerous graphics, charts, or "cute" presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These can distract from the resume's purpose, which is to quickly convey relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Opt for Simplicity**: A simple Microsoft Word template is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Choose a one-column layout and avoid bright, flashy colors or graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Fonts should be clean and easy to read, with basic colors like blue, black, or dark green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Generally, a resume should be "relatively boring" in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Exception for Creative Fields**: Graphic designers or individuals in other creative fields might opt for a more creative approach, as it may be expected in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Contact Information Layout**: Ensure contact information is listed vertically, not horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. ATS systems often struggle to parse horizontal data correctly, leading to manual data entry for applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Content Strategy for Effective Resumes

The way content is presented is crucial for [[recruitment_strategies_and_tips_for_successful_job_applications | successful job applications]].

*   **Profile, Don't Summarize**: Instead of summarizing every career accomplishment, focus on "profiling" for a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This means delivering exactly what the employer seeks, rather than hoping they find something they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Focus only on accomplishments relevant to the hiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Customize Your Resume**: [[optimizing_and_customizing_resumes_for_job_applications | Customization]] is vital, especially for competitive remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Customizing your resume provides a competitive advantage, helping you stand out in a different job market than 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Be Concise, Avoid Wordiness**: Long blocks of text make resumes difficult to scan and lead to recruiters and hiring managers skipping over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Be selective with words and how they are laid out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Remove Proprietary Language**: Avoid industry-specific jargon, project names, division names, or product types known only to your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Use clear, common language for the industry you're applying to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Generic, Fluffy Terminology**: Phrases like "team player" or "great organizational skills" are generic and make recruiters roll their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Important competencies will be assessed in an interview anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Focus on actionable terms and concepts related to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The goal is to convey a clear, concise fit for the job, not to use elaborate vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Iterative Improvement in Job Searching

If your resume isn't yielding results, don't be stubbornâ€”redo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Repeated rejections at the application level suggest the resume isn't working, especially if you believe you're a clear fit for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Be realistic about your fit for the jobs you're applying to by closely examining the job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Your resume must clearly convey your fit to maximize your chances of getting an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Remember to "plan, do, check, and adjust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. If your resume isn't getting the desired outcomes, make changes, try different versions, and mix it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

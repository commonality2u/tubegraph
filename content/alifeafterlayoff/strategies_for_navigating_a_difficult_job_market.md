It can feel impossible to get a job in today's market, with employer requirements often seeming out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This frustration is common and often justified, as companies frequently have "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, which are not listed on public job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These unspoken criteria are typically set by hiring managers or the hiring team, rather than the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Understanding Hidden Job Requirements

Internal selection guidelines sometimes reveal criteria that differ vastly from public job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These guidelines often outline the "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While requirements are usually realistic (e.g., core experience for a software developer role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, the "preferred" criteria can be subjective and reflect hiring manager bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

An example of extreme internal requirements for a software development role included:
*   **Education:** Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science from a "top program" (e.g., MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Melon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, University of Water). A 4.0 GPA from other schools might be an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Graduates of coding bootcamps are explicitly avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Experience:** 4 to 10 years of software development experience is required; less experience, even for a "genius," is not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS) and sometimes Kotlin, AI, and machine learning is also sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Career History:**
    *   **Longevity:** Candidates must have two or more years in each role; "job hoppers" are not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This includes individuals who lost jobs due to layoffs or company closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   **Company Type:** Significant experience in notable startups (e.g., backed by Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital) is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Candidates who have *only* worked for large companies (even Google or Facebook) are rejected because they are perceived as not understanding startup coding environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   **Contract Work:** Career contractors or those with any contract work in their background are excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   **Consulting Background:** Individuals from IT software development consulting firms are not considered to have the necessary competency for product-focused roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   **Founder Experience:** Bonus points are given for founding engineers or those with founder experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Demographics/Logistics:** Diversity hires (e.g., Black, female) are a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Candidates must be a US citizen, US permanent resident, green card holder, or Canadian citizen, with no visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Blacklisted Companies:** Candidates who have ever worked at companies like Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell are blacklisted and will "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

While this specific example is extreme, it highlights that many companies have unrealistic hidden requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

When faced with such challenges, job seekers should remember that "it's them and not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Here are some strategies:

*   **Optimize Your Resume:** Present yourself with the cleanest, most direct resume possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Targeted Networking:** Engage in targeted networking to find opportunities that align with your profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Showcase Your Skills:** If applicable to your industry, create a GitHub profile, a portfolio, or a simple website to demonstrate your skills and fit for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control:** Avoid applying for jobs with unrealistic requirements. If no one applies, companies will eventually need to adjust their hiring approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. By not submitting yourself to these types of rules, you reclaim control in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

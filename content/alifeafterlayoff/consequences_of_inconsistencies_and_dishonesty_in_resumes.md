When seeking new employment, job candidates should be aware that certain behaviors and discrepancies can be perceived as [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flags]] by potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. If a candidate consistently faces rejection, it may be due to behaviors or portrayals that give employers pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. One significant area of concern is any form of [[importance_of_honesty_in_job_applications_and_potential_consequences_of_falsifying_information | dishonesty]] or inconsistency in a resume or during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Discrepancy Between Experience and Resume

A major [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] is when a candidate's actual experience does not align with what is presented on their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This often stems from:
*   **Fabrication or embellishment** of qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Stuffing too many keywords** into the resume simply to get noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Candidates who embellish their resumes can be exposed publicly, especially during technical interviews where they must demonstrate their stated experience to experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. When such a discrepancy is found, employers will question every other claim made in the interview and on the resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Even a minor embellishment can lead to a complete loss of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_honesty_in_job_applications_and_potential_consequences_of_falsifying_information | importance of honesty]] and [[strategies_for_improving_resume_visibility_without_lying | avoiding false claims]].

## Getting Caught in a Lie

Being caught in a lie is a definite [[red_flags_in_job_applications | red flag]] that can lead to immediate disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Lying about experience with specific technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. If a candidate is exposed for not having the claimed technical experience, it can be a humiliating experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Misrepresenting reasons for leaving a previous job**, especially if it was a termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. While uncomfortable, lying about being fired is not the correct approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

A better way to handle past terminations or mistakes is to own what happened and demonstrate how lessons were learned from the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This approach shows accountability and a capacity for growth, which are highly valued by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Candidates should avoid being perceived as someone who never takes ownership when things go wrong or who believes they never make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

These examples underscore the severe [[temptation_and_consequences_of_lying_on_a_resume | consequences of lying on a resume]] or during interviews, as it directly impacts trust and credibility, jeopardizing job prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

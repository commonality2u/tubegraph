A corporate recruiter reacts to a video from Logical Finance, who applied for 1,000 jobs to assess the labor market, offering insights into [[recruiter_perspective_on_resume_writing | resume writing]] and [[job_application_pitfalls_and_tips | job application pitfalls and tips]] from a recruiter's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Choosing a Resume Template

When selecting a resume template, caution is advised, particularly with templates found on sites like Etsy or Canva. Many of these are designed by graphic designers with an emphasis on aesthetics rather than functionality for applicant tracking systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

<div class="callout callout-caution">
<h4>Avoid Graphic Designer Templates</h4>
Resumes designed by graphic designers often look pretty but are not functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. These templates can make your resume essentially invisible to recruiters searching within their ATS, preventing discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. They can also lead to incorrect data scraping, forcing manual correction during application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
</div>

### Ideal Resume Template Qualities
A recommended resume template should be:
*   **Clean and Simple** Free from excessive graphics, columns, and other design elements that can interfere with ATS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Maximally Discoverable** Designed to be easily scraped and parsed by ATS, ensuring your information is correctly captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Recruiter-Approved** Utilizing a template created by someone specialized in recruiting can significantly improve your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Checking for ATS Compliance
A key indicator that your resume is not ATS compliant is if you find yourself manually entering a lot of data (like address or phone number) after uploading it during an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This means the ATS is not correctly scraping your resume to populate its backend system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Resume Content: Objective vs. Career Summary

Regarding the initial section of a resume:
*   **Objective Statements** An objective statement is generally seen as pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Career Summary/Profile** A career summary or profile, however, is beneficial as it helps to brand or profile you correctly for a recruiter, especially when they are quickly reviewing resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## [[customizing_resumes_for_specific_roles | Resume Customization]]

[[customizing_resumes_for_specific_roles | Customizing your resume]] for each specific job application is the single most impactful action you can take to increase your chances of getting a callback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

<div class="callout callout-info">
<h4>Strategy for Multiple Career Paths</h4>
If you have multiple career verticals, it's recommended to have more than one version of your resume, each customized for a particular vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. Instead of being a "jack of all trades," niche down and be specific about the types of resumes you submit for much better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.
</div>

## Resume Writing as a Skill

Writing an effective resume requires significant effort and is a skill that must be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. If you are applying for many jobs for which you are reasonably qualified and not receiving results, it is almost always a [[common_resume_mistakes_to_avoid | resume issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

## Job Application Process Observations

*   **Direct Company Websites vs. Job Boards**: Applying directly on an employer's website can sometimes be seen more favorably than applying through a general job board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Direct applications usually provide the most accurate and up-to-date job listings, as job boards can sometimes display outdated or filled positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   **Assessment Tests**: Companies that require assessment tests (personality profiles, Wonderlic, etc.) at the application level often create a terrible candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. Recruiters suggest considering whether the company values your time if they implement such lengthy requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.
*   **"Entry-Level" Experience Meme**: The common meme about "entry-level" jobs requiring several years of experience is often an artifact of automated ATS systems or AI classifications rather than human error or intentional misleading by recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. When searching for jobs, it's better to search by job title rather than experience level (entry, mid-tier, executive), as ATS propagation can misclassify roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

## Current Job Market and Resume Impact

The experiment of applying to over 1,000 entry-level positions yielded a high response rate of 27-28% for interview requests, or potentially 35% if unreturned calls are counted as interview attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. This suggests a strong job market for job seekers at the time of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>. Even with a sub-optimal resume template and no customization, the response rate was surprisingly good, indicating a high demand for labor, particularly in entry-level roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>.

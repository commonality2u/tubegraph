Engaging in social activities with coworkers outside of work hours can seem like a harmless way to build rapport, but it carries significant risks that can impact your career and professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:28">[03:13:28]</a>. Being overly friendly or oversharing in these casual settings can lead to serious professional consequences, as detailed by an HR professional's personal experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:28">[03:13:28]</a>.

## A Hard-Learned Lesson

An HR professional recounts a pivotal experience early in their career while working as an HR generalist in a manufacturing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Stationed in a small town, they developed a friendly rapport with a line worker, leading to an invitation to a local bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. During this social outing, the conversation inevitably turned to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

> The coworker asked about a new, inexperienced supervisor. The HR professional made what they considered an "innocent comment" about the supervisor's growth and their role in helping him develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The next week, the HR professional's boss received a call from the supervisor, who was upset by rumors that the HR person was "spreading rumors about him to the employees that he wasn't a good leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The coworker had gone directly to the supervisor, claiming the HR professional "didn't have any faith" in him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This incident necessitated an apology and forced the HR professional to disengage socially with the coworker in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

This experience taught the HR professional a critical lesson: you must be very careful with people you choose to be friendly with at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Key Dangers of Blurring Lines

### Credibility and Career Stunting
Even seemingly [[consequences_of_oversharing_with_coworkers | innocent oversharing]] can find its way back to your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. If your boss starts to hear through the grapevine that you are not to be trusted, it creates a major credibility issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. An untrustworthy reputation can stunt your long-term career potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### The Impact of Office Gossip
[[the_impact_of_office_gossip_on_career_progression | Gossiping]] is prevalent in almost every office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. While water cooler talk is common, it can easily cross the line into [[consequences_of_oversharing_with_coworkers | oversharing]] or saying something you'll regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. The bigger concern is being **branded as an office gossip** if you associate with these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Leadership teams observe who associates with whom, and being part of the gossip clique can significantly hinder your ability to move up in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. To avoid this, it's advised to get your water, say hello, and leave without getting drawn into drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Negative Influence
Office gossips often tend to be negative people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Spending too much time with coworkers who have a negative mindset can inevitably bring you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. These individuals constantly complain about management, company practices, or feeling undervalued, and their negativity can become a "cancer in a group," distracting those focused on [[navigating_workplace_promotions_and_relationships | upward mobility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. It's crucial to [[avoiding_negative_discussions_about_coworkers_and_bosses | avoid negative people]] in your workspace to prevent them from dragging you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### Workplace Competition and Compromise
Even strong workplace friendships can become strained when a promotion opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. If you receive a [[navigating_workplace_promotions_and_relationships | promotion]] over a close coworker, the relationship can become incredibly competitive and awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. Furthermore, if a coworker knows your "dirty secrets" from past casual conversations, they could potentially compromise you, especially if you are put in an awkward situation as their supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. A jealous coworker can hold back your progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### The Risks of Alcohol and Loose Lips
Another significant danger is when social events involve alcohol, leading to "loose lips" and potentially inappropriate behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. There's a very fine line between being chummy and harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. This doesn't only refer to overt harassment but can include off-color jokes that might offend someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. As an old HR adage states, "anything that you say or do at work can come back to haunt you at a later date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Therefore, extreme caution is advised at happy hours or other off-hours events with coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## Navigating Workplace Relationships
While it's possible to be [[the_reality_of_workplace_relationships | friends with your coworkers]], it's crucial to pick and choose your friends very carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Always be cautious about your behavior, what you say, and what you choose to [[things_not_to_disclose_to_coworkers | share with them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

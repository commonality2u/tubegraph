It is common for individuals to make [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career mistakes]] throughout their professional lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many of these mistakes are learned "the hard way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, and often stem from misperceptions about the value of loyalty in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Critical Early Career Mistakes

A significant mistake that may not be recognized until much later in a career is staying in a job for too long or overstaying one's welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This can include:
*   Not responding to promising job opportunities due to fear or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   Accepting a job that wasn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Failing to embrace geographical changes that could lead to new [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career paths]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   Focusing too long on a specific job type or career vertical that ultimately doesn't resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

Coaching often reveals that individuals are unhappy with their [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career progression]] due to past missteps related to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Loyalty Rarely Pays Off

A key lesson, often learned painfully, is that [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | loyalty rarely pays off]] in the context of [[career_advancement and job satisfaction | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Personal Anecdote: The Dangling Carrot
One personal example highlights this: an individual stayed in a role for several years, believing in a promise of advancement under a senior leader who was supposed to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Despite the leader having no intention of leaving, the individual remained loyal to the leader and organization, expecting to "pay their dues" and eventually be promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This loyalty led to:
*   Stagnation in their career path, as the "dangling carrot" of promotion never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   The job market moving past their skills and experience, leaving them behind their peer group in terms of leadership roles and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

This demonstrates how [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | excessive company loyalty]] can hinder [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | career progression]] and earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Hard Work vs. Smart Work for Promotion
A related misconception is that hard work automatically leads to [[career_advancement_and_job_satisfaction | promotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Often, putting in long hours only results in the "dangling carrot" being pushed further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

Instead of working the most hours, it's crucial to work the smartest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Focusing on projects that are highly visible and important to senior leadership (your boss's boss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   Proactively advocating for oneself and letting the right people know about accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. This aligns with [[the_role_of_networking_and_selfpromotion_in_career_advancement | the role of networking and self-promotion]].
*   Acting as the "CEO of your career," managing your personal marketing and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

## The Ephemeral Nature of Goodwill

A particularly painful lesson, underscored by recent layoffs, is that an individual is "only as good as what they've done last," or "what have you done for me lately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

*   Past achievements, even major projects, build only very short-lived goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   If an employer perceives a lack of current or future contribution, an employee may find themselves on a layoff list, regardless of past [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_progression | loyalty]] or hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
*   Senior leaders prioritize what an employee can produce tomorrow over what they produced yesterday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

This cold reality emphasizes the importance of acting as a "free agent" in one's [[career_advancement_through_selfinterest | career]], always looking out for oneself first rather than relying on outdated notions of company loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

When deciding to [[quitting_your_job_advantages_and_disadvantages | quit your job]], it is crucial to do so in the most [[proper_etiquette_for_quitting_a_job | proper way]] to ensure a graceful and dignified exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. A corporate recruiter and HR professional with over 20 years of experience emphasizes the significance of this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## What Not to Do
Quitting a job incorrectly can lead to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Storming out, kicking over a computer, or telling an employer "take this job and shove it" is the wrong approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Such actions will likely result in not being eligible for rehire, burning all bridges, and potentially facing legal repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The temporary satisfaction from a spectacular exit will not outweigh the long-term damage to one's reputation and potential future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Good work friends might also view such behavior as risky or unstable, making them less likely to offer referrals to future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## [[preparing_to_quit_a_job_safely | Preparing to Quit Safely]]
Before informing anyone about your intention to leave, it's essential to have all your "ducks in a row" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This includes:
*   **Confirmed Start Date:** Ensure you have a confirmed start date with your new employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Pre-Employment Checks:** Verify that all pre-employment requirements, such as drug screens, background checks, and reference checks, are complete and cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Issues with background checks can sometimes lead to offers being pulled, leaving you without either job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Discretion:** Do not disclose your job search or new opportunity to work friends, no matter how close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Rumors can spread quickly and impact your current employment status before you are ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Keep your plans discreet and professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

## How to Give Notice
### Informing Your Boss
Once you have a confirmed start date, the next step is to set a meeting with your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Method:** This conversation should be face-to-face or via a Zoom call, not through email or text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Communication:** Keep the conversation concise and to the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Avoid elaborate explanations, especially if you are leaving a toxic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. A simple statement such as, "I have another opportunity that is the best move for my family, and I am giving my two weeks' notice," is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Neutrality:** Approach the conversation with "emotion zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Your decision should already be made, and expressing negative feelings or trashing the company will not benefit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Professionalism:** Always take the high road, be professional, and extend a high degree of courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Thank them for their time and the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### Informing Coworkers and Clients
After informing your boss, ask for their blessing before telling coworkers, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Following this [[proper_etiquette_for_quitting_a_job | proper protocol]] leaves a good impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

*   **Consideration:** Recognize that your departure will create a void and increase workloads for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Be gracious and appreciative when speaking to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Thanks:** Contact individuals who were instrumental in your career (e.g., trainers, mentors) directly to offer a personal thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **Networking:** Ask these individuals to join your personal network, connecting on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. This helps build powerful networks for future job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

## The Two-Week Notice
It is highly recommended to give at least a two-week notice as a courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. While there is no legal requirement to do so, it provides an opportunity to tie up loose ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

*   **Courtesy to Coworkers:** The two-week notice primarily serves as a courtesy to your colleagues and boss, allowing them to prepare for your departure and manage the transition of your responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. It prevents your coworkers from being "screwed over" and having to scramble to pick up your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Transition Plan:** Work with your boss to create a transition plan to ensure proper handover of tasks and customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **Last Day Huddle:** On your last day, hold a quick huddle with your team, especially those who were influential to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Keep your [[reasons_for_leaving_a_job_and_how_to_discuss_them | reasons for leaving]] generic and positive, focusing on a new opportunity that is better for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Express appreciation for working with the team and the opportunity to grow your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Avoid trashing the company or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

## [[maintaining_professional_relationships_after_resignation | Maintaining Professional Relationships]]
Leaving on good terms helps maintain professional relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. You never know when you might need to leave the door cracked open for future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

*   **Rehire Potential:** Inquire if you would be considered for rehire should circumstances change with your new opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **References:** Maintain good terms with former bosses, as they will be crucial references for future job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Future Opportunities:** A positive exit can lead to referrals or opportunities to work with former colleagues or bosses again in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

Ultimately, how you treat people when you leave an organization reflects on your "employment brand" and will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. It is always recommended to leave on good terms and leave a great impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

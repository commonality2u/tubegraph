While an advocate for strategic career planning, certain circumstances necessitate an immediate departure from a job. These "deal breaker" situations often involve legal, ethical, or safety concerns that compromise an individual's well-being or integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Staying in a position that is unhealthy can negatively impact one's health, finances, career trajectory, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## When to Quit Your Job: Deal Breaker Situations

A steady job should not be an excuse for tolerating [[toxic_work_environments | poor working conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Recruiters and hiring managers differentiate between "job hopping" and leaving a genuinely [[identifying_toxic_workplaces | bad situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Suffering Emotionally or Physically

If a role leads to mental and physical distress, it's a clear sign to leave quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Overwork, being overwhelmed, or being "in over your head" can lead to significant [[health_and_safety_in_office_environments | health issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This can affect not only the individual but also their loved ones and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Red Flag: Needing medical attention due to job-related stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. No job should cause such extreme stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Symptoms of job-related stress include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>:
*   Loss of appetite or sudden weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Loss of sleep or sleepless nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   Loss of interest in hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Anxiety or anxiousness, waking up thinking about work tasks or uncomfortable meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Physical manifestations like hair loss or hives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   Complete lack of motivation or dreading showing up for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

If you develop physical or mental ailments due to your job, it's crucial to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, as your [[health_and_safety_in_office_environments | health is paramount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### A Toxic Work Culture

A company that prioritizes "win at all costs" often signals a [[toxic_work_environments | bad or toxic work culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This mentality typically originates from the top leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. While competitiveness is acceptable, winning at the expense of employees or ethical practices is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Indicator: If a company's published core values are not reflected by the leadership team in daily operations, it's a sign that something is amiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

[[Toxic workplace indicators | Signs of a toxic culture]] also include:
*   Lack of respect in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
*   Unrealistic or unobtainable goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
*   Lack of recognition for accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
*   Toxic colleagues who spread rumors or undermine others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>

If management is oblivious to or aligns with toxic individuals, it's advisable to seek employment elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Illegal Company Activities

If a company is breaking the law or, worse, asking employees to do so, immediate departure is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This indicates a "directionless" moral compass within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, and employees could be held personally liable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Examples of illegal activities include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>:
*   Financial shadiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   Questionable environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   Breaches of human resources laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>

> [!TIP] Action: If you witness illegal activity, first report it to the HR department or legal department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. If no action is taken, it's time to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, as no job is worth damaging your professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Being Asked to Do Something Unsafe

Despite governing bodies like OSHA, some companies may disregard safety protocols to complete tasks quickly and maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. However, [[health_and_safety_in_office_environments | safety is non-negotiable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

If a company asks you to perform an unsafe task or skirt OSHA guidelines, it demonstrates a lack of commitment to your well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

> [!TIP] Action: Trust your intuition. If something feels unsafe, voice your concerns to your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. If they don't respond, escalate the concern to your HR leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. A responsible leader would immediately stop work to address safety issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

If a company values its bottom line over your life or well-being, it is absolutely worth leaving the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, as no job is worth risking your life or limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

When seeking a new career opportunity, it's crucial to identify companies that are truly outstanding employers. This involves looking beyond the surface and assessing their policies and practices regarding internal promotions and employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These factors serve as key indicators of a positive and stable work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Promoting from Within

One of the first signs of a great company is its commitment to promoting employees internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
A recommended question to ask during an interview is: "Why is the position open?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. If the response indicates that the previous occupant was promoted to a more advanced role, it's a very positive sign that the company fosters a culture of internal advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Some companies may be resistant to internal promotions, while others actively encourage a high percentage of internal movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A high rate of internal movement is a "super positive sign" because it suggests that applying oneself can lead to career progression and staying ahead of the employment curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Targeting companies that prioritize internal movement can be highly beneficial for your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Turnover Rates

Another critical factor to examine is a company's turnover rates, particularly involuntary turnover such as terminations or [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | layoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Strong companies generally do not have significant [[high_turnover_rates_and_their_red_flags | turnover issues]] because employees are content and choose to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

While it might be challenging for an external candidate to ascertain exact turnover rates, some investigative work can provide insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Checking press releases for recent [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | layoffs]] is one method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Companies that engage in [[handling_of_layoffs_by_companies | layoffs]] and then quickly rehire for those same positions may not be ideal employers, as such "knee-jerk reactions" can leave employees constantly wondering about job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The industry standard turnover rate is approximately 20%, though this can vary by industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Ideally, you should aim for companies with turnover rates under 20%, as these figures are strong indicators of a healthy corporate culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Companies that invest in personal development for their employees also tend to have very low [[high_turnover_in_departments | turnover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Employee Morale and Work-Life Balance

Closely related to turnover is overall employee morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. While difficult to gauge directly in an interview, looking at reviews online (e.g., Glassdoor, Indeed, Comparably) and observing the workplace culture if you visit on-site can provide clues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. A positive sign is when employees appear to enjoy their work and their colleagues, indicating high morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

A great company also hires an appropriate number of staff to ensure manageable workloads and values providing employees with time off to recharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Be wary of companies that expect long hours or have consistent negative feedback about work-life balance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Generous vacation policies are another positive indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Job seeking and interviewing can be challenging, but understanding certain "tells" from employers can help you identify low-quality opportunities and potentially avoid headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Listening carefully for specific questions that seem "off-putting or slightly off center" can indicate a low-quality employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Recognizing these [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags]] can empower you to make informed decisions about whether to pursue an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Common Red Flag Interview Questions

Here are several questions that might signal a problematic workplace, along with strategies on [[effective_interview_tactics_for_job_seekers | how to respond]] or interpret them. These can be considered [[common_trap_interview_questions_and_how_to_avoid_them | common trap interview questions]].

### "How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** While seemingly innocent, this question often indicates an employer's concern about attendance issues. It suggests they might have a history of such problems, leading to overly particular attendance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It can also imply they already view you as a potential attendance risk and that the workplace is likely inflexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **How to Respond:** Instead of directly answering, redirect the question back to the interviewer by asking about their expectations for unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If they indicate a strict "cracking down" approach, it could be a sign of a toxic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### "What's your minimum acceptable salary?"
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** This question is a direct attempt to determine the lowest possible salary they can offer to secure your commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. It suggests a lack of flexibility in compensation and an employer who may consistently try to "nickel and dime" you, potentially hindering future raises and promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### "Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** This question is a strong indicator of a significant turnover issue within the company or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. They are likely struggling to retain employees in the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **How to Respond:** If asked, consider probing deeper by asking, "Why are people leaving so quickly that you feel the need to assess this in a job interview?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

### "Have you ever been fired?"
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** This question delves into past employment decisions that are not necessarily relevant to your current abilities or potential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. A past termination might have been due to a specific bad situation, not necessarily a reflection of future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **How to Respond:** Redirect the conversation to your capabilities and accomplishments for the role at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. For example: "I'm not quite sure how my employment status would have any impact on my ability to do this job. I'm happy to discuss my accomplishments in the roles that I've worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. If they continue to press, it might be advisable to withdraw your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Accusations of Resume Exaggeration
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** If an interviewer accuses you of exaggerating or embellishing your resume (assuming you haven't), it signals a fundamental lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This implies they either distrust you specifically or operate under the assumption that all candidates are dishonest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Implication:** This is a clear sign of a potentially toxic employer and a culture where trust is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### "What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** This is often a [[common_trap_interview_questions_and_how_to_avoid_them | trap question]] that offers little insight beyond potentially using your answer against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. While some might aim to assess how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase such a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **How to Respond:** When answering, dedicate minimal time to detailing the failure itself. Instead, focus on how you overcame the adversity and transformed it into a positive learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Asking about Availability for Off-Shifts/Weekends (for a standard shift role) or On-Site Visits (for a remote role)
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** If you're interviewing for a specific shift or a remote role, and they inquire about your availability for other shifts, weekends, or frequent on-site presence, it strongly suggests you will likely be working unwanted overtime or that the remote job is actually a hybrid role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This indicates a potential work-life imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. For remote roles, a hybrid job pitched as fully remote has a high likelihood of eventually transitioning to a 100% in-office requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **How to Respond:** Push back on the question and seek clear expectations regarding actual work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Clarify what "remote" truly entails for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### "How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** This question immediately raises the concern about working with "a-holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. If the rudeness stems from a manager, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This indicates a pre-existing cultural issue within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## The Absence of Questions: A Major Red Flag

One of the most significant [[identifying_red_flags_in_job_interviews | red flags]] is when the interviewer does not provide you with an opportunity to [[asking_questions_to_interviewers | ask questions]] of your own and dominates the entire conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **The Ulterior Motive:** This signals that the employer views the interview as a one-sided assessment, forgetting that it's a two-way street where you should also be assessing the company and the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. It suggests they believe they are "above you" and that you should not be assessing them at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Implication:** Such an attitude indicates a potentially undesirable company culture where your input or perspective might not be valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

While one or two of these questions alone might not signify a poor-quality company, they serve as crucial "data points" for your assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Always ensure you [[asking_questions_to_interviewers | ask really good probing questions]] yourself to gain a deeper understanding of the company culture and what you're committing to before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This proactive approach is part of effective [[interview_questions_preparation | interview questions preparation]] and helps in [[avoiding_generic_responses_in_job_interviews | avoiding generic responses]].

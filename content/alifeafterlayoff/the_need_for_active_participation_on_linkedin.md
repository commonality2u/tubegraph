The following article outlines common mistakes on LinkedIn and emphasizes the need for active participation to maximize career opportunities, as advised by a corporate recruiter with 20 years of experience.

## The Need for Active Participation on LinkedIn

Having a strong presence on LinkedIn is crucial for job seekers and professionals. A corporate recruiter with two decades of experience, who has hired thousands of individuals for prominent companies, highlights that LinkedIn is used extensively for [[linkedins_role_in_active_talent_sourcing | active talent sourcing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Recruiters prefer LinkedIn over untargeted job postings because it allows them to narrow down searches to find perfect candidate matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Many job seekers make [[common_mistakes_on_linkedin_profiles | common mistakes on LinkedIn profiles]] that limit their opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Enabling Contact and Engagement

A primary mistake is not [[importance_of_allowing_contact_on_linkedin | allowing contact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Recruiters use a separate platform called LinkedIn Recruiter to search the database from the back end, utilizing keywords and filters to find specific skill sets, often through boolean searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. It is frustrating for recruiters to find a perfect candidate but be unable to reach out because contact is blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Blocking contact means missing out on great opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Even passive candidates, who are not actively seeking a new job, should allow recruiters to contact them. It only takes a few seconds to review emails, and it could lead to a valuable opportunity that would otherwise be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Receiving frequent emails from recruiters indicates that a profile is in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Therefore, keeping contact options open is essential, especially when looking for career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Optimizing with Keywords

Another mistake is failing to use keywords effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Recruiters use strings of keywords tied together with advanced search strategies (boolean searching) to find targeted profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. If a [[improving_linkedin_profiles_with_ai | LinkedIn profile]] does not contain these specific keywords, it will not appear in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

To improve visibility, professionals should [[utilizing_keywords_for_linkedin_search_optimization | load their LinkedIn profile]] with all relevant keywords that a recruiter might be looking for, based on common industry terms and job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The more keywords included, the easier it is for recruiters to find the profile, increasing the likelihood of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Maintaining Activity on the Platform

Beyond profile optimization, being active on LinkedIn is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Having a great profile with keywords and open contact settings is useless if messages are never checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **Check messages regularly**: Keep a pulse on what's happening and check emails, or set up notifications to an email address that is checked daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. LinkedIn settings can be adjusted to receive only direct emails, avoiding excessive notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **See job opportunities**: Recruiters often repost high-quality positions, and many job opportunities appear directly in the LinkedIn feed from connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Being active allows users to see these opportunities without actively searching for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Stay informed**: LinkedIn is a great way to stay updated on industry trends and what others are working on, especially in white-collar professions where [[networking_effectively_on_linkedin | networking]] is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Building Your Network

Many users make the mistake of not [[networking_effectively_on_linkedin | networking]] themselves effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. A low number of connections (e.g., less than 100) suggests a lack of activity and a less robust network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. There is no practical limit to the number of connections one can have on LinkedIn (up to 35,000-50,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The more connections, the greater the visibility and opportunity for [[importance_of_networking_and_personal_branding_on_linkedin | personal branding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

*   **Start with known contacts**: Connect with previous employers, colleagues, bosses, and individuals from broader circles (e.g., educational institutions, professional associations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Expand to industry peers**: Connect with professionals in similar roles and companies within the target industry. These connections often lead to direct job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Target a minimum of 500+ connections**: Aim for at least 500 connections so that the profile displays "500+" connections, which makes a user appear more active and invested in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Engaging and Creating Content

Being a "lurker" – someone who never engages on posts or creates their own content – prevents a name from being seen and limits visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. A large network is meaningless without engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

*   **Build an employment brand**: Engaging with thoughtful comments and creating good content that sparks discussion helps build an [[importance_of_networking_and_personal_branding_on_linkedin | employment brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Recruiters notice active users who regularly engage and contribute to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Start small**: If uncomfortable, start by engaging on one post a day, or creating one to three posts of original content per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Consistency will yield surprising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Avoiding Controversial Discussions

A critical mistake to avoid is getting involved in controversial discussions, especially regarding politics, religion, or belief systems unrelated to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Engaging in "screaming matches" or unprofessional debates on LinkedIn can expose a user's arguments to hundreds of thousands of people across various networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Such behavior can severely damage one's professional brand, as recruiters might judge the user's suitability for an office setting, regardless of whether they agree with the opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. LinkedIn is not the appropriate platform for "soapbox" discussions; content should remain work-related, professional, and respectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

By avoiding these common mistakes and actively participating in [[the_impact_of_linkedin_on_the_job_market | the job market]] through LinkedIn, job seekers can significantly increase their chances of finding desired opportunities and improving their professional standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

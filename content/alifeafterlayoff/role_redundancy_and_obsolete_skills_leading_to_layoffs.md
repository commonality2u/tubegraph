Being affected by a layoff can be a significant setback, often leading to self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While many assume layoffs are due to [[performance and layoffs | performance]] issues, most reasons for being laid off have nothing to do with individual [[performance and layoffs | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. One key factor is the obsolescence of skills or the redundancy of a role within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Skills Becoming Obsolete

Companies may implement layoffs due to skills becoming obsolete, meaning those skills are no longer needed by the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This is distinct from [[performance and layoffs | performance]] issues, as it reflects a change in organizational need rather than an employee's capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. If an employee's skills do not evolve with the market, they may find themselves on a layoff list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Staying Relevant
To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to:
*   Closely monitor industry trends and market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Acquire the latest software and technical skills that are in demand across the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Pay attention to company evolution and directives, reskilling to become an expert in new areas (e.g., new software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Maintaining current skills can help avoid being targeted for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Role Redundancy

Just as skills can become obsolete, certain job types or roles may no longer be required as an organization evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The continuous evolution of the market means that some roles become redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to accelerate this trend, making it a case of "adapt or be left behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Departmental Shifts
[[departmental_shifts_and_strategic_direction_in_layoffs | Departmental shifts and strategic direction in layoffs]] can also lead to role redundancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. If a department changes its focus and de-emphasizes certain products or groups, employees in those areas may be laid off, regardless of their [[performance and layoffs | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This happens even to top performers or those recently promoted, as it relates to the [[departmental_shifts_and_strategic_direction_in_layoffs | strategic direction of the organization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

While predicting such shifts is difficult, one can de-risk by:
*   Avoiding organizations with experimental or "skunk works" projects during times of [[Job market instability and frequent layoffs | economic uncertainty]], as these are often the first to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   Ensuring one's project, team, or division is part of the core business or contributes significantly to revenue, as non-core or non-profitable areas may be targeted for downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Cost Cutting Measures

Cost cutting is another major reason for layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Employees in experimental or non-profitable divisions are often targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Companies may eliminate projects or de-emphasize entire departments to reduce expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

During cost-cutting, companies may examine departments for high-earning employees, comparing their salaries to their output or skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Senior employees whose skills have atrophied or who haven't kept pace with the market, despite having large salaries, may be targeted for replacement by cheaper alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Payroll is a significant company expense and is closely scrutinized during [[Job market instability and frequent layoffs | economic uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Disruptive technologies like AI can also lead to the elimination of more positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Reclaiming Control of Your Career

Despite the unfairness of layoffs, individuals can reclaim control by acting as the "CEO of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This involves:
*   **Skill Development:** Continuously building in-demand skill sets based on overall market demands, not just company-specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Resume Maintenance:** Keeping resumes up-to-date and considering other opportunities that align with long-term career visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Networking:** Actively networking, including with competitors, to stay well-connected within the industry and secure better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Targeted networking is a critical tool for job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Multiple Income Streams:** Developing multiple streams of income to reduce complete dependence on a single employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Being laid off does not mean one is "damaged goods" or indicates a [[performance and layoffs | performance]] issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

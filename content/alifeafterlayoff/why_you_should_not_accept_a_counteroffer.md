When an employee secures a new job offer and informs their current employer, it is common for the current company to scramble and present a counteroffer, often promising a new job title or a larger compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience advises against accepting these [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_accepting_a_counter_offer | counteroffers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## High Likelihood of Departure
Statistics indicate a strong trend of employees leaving shortly after accepting a counteroffer. According to LinkedIn, an overwhelming majority of people who accept [[understanding_counteroffers_from_employers | counteroffers]] will not remain with their company:
*   **80% or more** will not be with their company after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **93%** will not be with their company after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

This pattern is consistent with real-life observations, where candidates who accept counters often return to the job market within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Persistent Issues
The primary reason to decline a counteroffer is that the underlying issues that prompted the job search in the first place will likely still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These may include:
*   A bad boss or difficult colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   A poor company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Issues with work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   An undesirable commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   Substandard benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

If an employee has reached the point of considering another offer, it is usually for a significant reason, and these reasons generally do not disappear with a counteroffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Employees should prioritize their own career needs, as companies can lay off long-tenured employees without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Leaving a toxic environment or dying industry is not just ethical, but strategically smart for one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Employer's Motivation and Changed Relationships
When a company offers a counter, it often signifies that they were undervaluing the employee until the threat of departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This can imply that they took the employee for granted or advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Accepting a counteroffer can also negatively impact relationships and long-term career prospects within the company:
*   **Buying Time for Replacement** Employers might offer a counter to buy time to find a replacement and transfer knowledge, effectively making the employee redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Damaged Trust** Once an employee broadcasts an intention to leave, their boss will likely create a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The employer will be prepared for a future departure and may label the employee as not long-term committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Increased Layoff Risk** When the company faces financial difficulties, employees who have demonstrated dissatisfaction or have higher salaries (due to the counteroffer) may be among the first considered for adverse employment decisions or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Limited Future Prospects** Even if a promotion or expanded responsibility is promised, it may be a temporary measure to retain the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Senior leaders may view the employee as less dedicated, passing them over for future promotional opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Honeymoon Period** Any temporary improvements in workplace conditions or relationships usually wear off, and the original issues resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Working alongside a boss one effectively threatened to quit on can also be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Conclusion
Deciding whether to accept a counteroffer is a difficult decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, it's advised to consider the long-term [[effects_of_accepting_a_counteroffer_on_career_prospects | effects of accepting a counteroffer on career prospects]] and remember that, like an old relationship, if it ended for a reason, it's often best to look forward to new beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

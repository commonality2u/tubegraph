The modern job market can feel challenging, with employer requirements often seeming out of touch. This sentiment is supported by the existence of "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Brian, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience, aims to demystify how careers and [[recruitment_strategies_and_tips_for_successful_job_applications | hiring]] works at most major corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Understanding Hidden Job Requirements

Job seekers often feel frustrated by seemingly ridiculous job postings, and this frustration is justified because companies frequently have unstated, internal criteria that influence [[recruitment_strategies_and_tips_for_successful_job_applications | hiring decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### The Accidental Leak of Internal Guidelines

A significant example of these hidden requirements came to light when a recruiter accidentally emailed secret internal selection guidelines to a technical candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These guidelines, provided by the [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring manager]] or other [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring authorities]] at the company, were never intended for public consumption and were drastically different from the public job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The candidate expressed strong frustration, stating, "The sheer pretentiousness and elitism kind of pissed me off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### The Role of Hiring Managers and Recruiters

Typically, the [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring manager]] creates a list of requirements for a role and shares it with the recruiter when a job requisition is opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. During an "intake call," the recruiter and [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring manager]] discuss "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred criteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Requirements (Must-haves)**: These are usually obvious, such as total years of experience, degree requirements, or core experience in a specific field (e.g., software development for a software developer role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. They tend to be more realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Preferred (Nice-to-haves)**: This is where criteria become looser and can reveal [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager biases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. While candidates often blame recruiters for bias, it is more often the [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring manager]] or the [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring team]] that holds these biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

A competent recruiter should challenge unrealistic demands from a [[recruiter_and_hiring_manager_responsibilities | hiring manager]], pointing out that such criteria will eliminate many good candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, this often doesn't happen, especially with junior recruiters unfamiliar with job profiles or market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Case Study: An Extreme Example of Hidden Requirements

The leaked internal guidelines for a software development role illustrate the extreme nature of some hidden requirements:

### Desired Candidate Profile ("What We Are Looking For")

*   **Education**:
    *   University graduate with a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   Must be from a "top program" like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, or University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   A special exception *might* be made for candidates from other schools with a 4.0 GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Experience**:
    *   Exactly 4 to 10 years of software development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Candidates with fewer than four or more than ten years of experience are not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS) and sometimes modern tech like Kotlin, along with knowledge of AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   Significant experience in "notable startups" backed by firms like Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   "Founding engineer" or "founder experience" is a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Career Stability**:
    *   Longevity in roles, requiring 2+ years in each position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. "Job hoppers" are not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This includes individuals who lost jobs due to layoffs or company closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Citizenship**:
    *   Must be a US citizen, US permanent resident (green card holder), or Canadian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. No visa sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. (This is a common and realistic requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.)
*   **Diversity**:
    *   Diversity hires (Black, female, etc.) are considered a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Undesired Candidate Profile ("What to Avoid")

*   **Employment Status**:
    *   Visa candidates (no visa sponsorships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
    *   Career contractors; only permanent work experience is accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Career History**:
    *   Job hoppers with frequent short stints in roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   Graduates of coding bootcamps (e.g., Full Stack Academy, Hacked Reactor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Candidates with a consulting background (worked at an IT software development firm instead of a product-producing company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   Candidates with experience limited to big companies (e.g., Uber, Intel) unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   Candidates who have ever worked at specific "blacklisted" companies, including Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Verification**:
    *   Fake profiles; recruiters are expected to screen candidates properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. (An increase in fake profiles is observed, especially with AI-generated resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.)

## Impact and Recommendations for Job Seekers

Such extreme and hidden requirements make the [[recruitment_strategies and tips for successful job applications | candidate pool]] significantly smaller and the job search more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While the leaked example is extreme, many companies have hidden criteria that are never listed in job postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

<div class="callout">
    **"It's them and not you."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>
    When facing frustrating and unrealistic job requirements, job seekers are justified in their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Strategies for Job Seekers

*   **Optimize Your Application**: Present yourself with the cleanest, most direct resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Networking**: Engage in targeted networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Showcase Your Work**: If applicable to your industry, create a GitHub profile, portfolio, or a simple website to demonstrate your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Reclaim Control**: Avoid applying for jobs with unreasonable requirements. If companies receive no applications, they will be forced to adjust their [[employer_hiring_strategies_and_ethics | hiring approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This means not subjecting yourself to such rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Move On**: Don't lose sleep over unrealistic [[recruitment_strategies_and_tips_for_successful_job_applications | hiring managers]]; simply move on to the next opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

The question "Why should we hire you?" is often considered one of the most feared questions job seekers encounter in an interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article provides a strategy for answering it effectively, based on what corporate recruiters seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Understanding the Interviewer's Intent

When an interviewer asks "Why should we hire you?", they are trying to gauge whether the job seeker understands what the company is trying to accomplish with the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It's crucial to understand why the position is open and why the company needs to fill it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### The Hiring Manager's Perspective

A new position is typically created because a hiring manager has a business gap or problem that needs to be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This could be due to replacing an employee or a new business need requiring additional headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This problem leads to the creation of a business case, which then generates a requisition for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### The Recruiter's Role (Intake Call)

Recruiters work closely with hiring managers, conducting "intake calls" to review job specifications and identify critical skills needed for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. During this conversation, recruiters create an "ideal candidate profile" by understanding the business problem the position aims to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This understanding of the business problem is key to answering "Why should we hire you?" effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Who Asks This Question?

While a recruiter might ask initial [[asking_questions_to_interviewers | questions to interviewers]], the "Why should we hire you?" question is most likely to come from the hiring manager during later stages of the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## A Three-Part Formula for Your Answer

To effectively answer "Why should we hire you?", use a three-part formula:

1.  **Understand the Business Problem**
    *   Identify why the position is open and the specific business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This could be a new project, a new skill set needed, or a new division being launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
    *   **How to find this out:**
        *   Pay close attention to the job description, highlighting major points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This provides key indicators of what the business is looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
        *   Listen closely to what the recruiter says during your preliminary screen, as they will provide insight and keys to help sell yourself in later interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

2.  **Link Your Past Experiences to the Business Problem**
    *   Once you understand the business problem, connect your previous experience to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
    *   Frame your answer in terms of how you have already solved similar problems in other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
    *   Emphasize your track record of success in handling comparable projects or situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This aligns your background with the specific challenge the company faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

3.  **Show How You Can Solve the Same Problem for *Them***
    *   Go beyond just linking past experience; explain *how* you would solve their specific business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
    *   Provide concrete examples of how you would approach their project or challenge, for example, "I've worked on this type of project before; this is how I would solve it: I would do this, this, and this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
    *   This helps the interviewer visualize you effectively performing the required tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Generic Responses

A common mistake job seekers make is giving generic answers to this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### Examples of Generic Responses to Avoid:

*   "I'm a team player." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>
*   "I like to give 110%." (This is physically impossible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>
*   "I'm a fast learner." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>
*   "I achieve results." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>
*   "I'm going to jump into your team and hit the ground running." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>

While these statements sound positive, they are too generic and don't provide specific information about the candidate's capabilities or how they would address the company's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Instead, focus on demonstrating how you can [[avoiding_generic_responses_in_job_interviews | avoid generic responses in job interviews]] by tying business results you've achieved in the past directly to the company's current business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

When asked "Why should we hire you?" in an interview, focus on understanding the business problem, linking it to your past achievements, and showing how you can solve that same problem for the prospective employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. By following this formula, you can align your qualifications with the company's needs and increase your chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

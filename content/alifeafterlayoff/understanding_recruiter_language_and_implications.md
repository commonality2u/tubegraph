This article provides an insider's perspective on what [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiters]] say during job interviews versus what they actually mean, offering an advantage to job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The insights shared come from a corporate [[Role of recruiters in job search | recruiter]] with over 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Types of Recruiters

It's important to distinguish between two main types of [[Role of recruiters versus hiring managers | recruiters]]:

*   **Headhunters (External Recruiters)**: These are third-party individuals or firms contracted by companies to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They typically get paid on contingency, meaning they receive a fee (usually 15% to 25% of the candidate's first year income) only if their candidate is hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Headhunters generally have a lower level of knowledge about the specific role compared to internal [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Corporate Recruiters (Internal Recruiters)**: These are full-time employees of a company, often part of a talent acquisition department or under the HR umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Their job is to find the best possible talent and they are paid a salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Their primary metric is placing the best fit for their [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | hiring manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Internal [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiters]] often support specific functional groups and build strong relationships with [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | hiring managers]], leading to clear alignment on position requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The insider information provided focuses specifically on interviews with internal corporate [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Recruiter Statements and Their Hidden Meanings

### "What do you know about the company?"

*   **Meaning**: This is a baseline question in the first interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A lack of understanding about the company or position is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. It indicates your level of interest and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Be prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### "Do you have specific skills or competencies?"

*   **Meaning**: If a [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] asks about a specific skill or experience, it's usually a [[hidden_job_requirements_in_recruitment | requirement]] for the position that the [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | hiring manager]] needs to see on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Without it, you're unlikely to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While not 100% true (other strengths might compensate), it's generally a critical baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Repeatedly Rephrasing Questions

*   **Meaning**: If a [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] has to rephrase a question or bring you back to it repeatedly, you are likely missing the mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Each question is carefully tailored to assess a specific competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It's acceptable to ask for clarification, "Can you please give me an idea of what it is that you're looking for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Rambling Without Follow-Up Questions

*   **Meaning**: If you speak for a long time without the [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] asking follow-up questions, you are almost certainly moving to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Long-windedness is considered the "kiss of death" in interviews because it suggests an inability to communicate effectively and influence senior leaders in a business setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Answer directly and concisely, allowing the interviewer to probe if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Asking About Compensation Expectation vs. Not Asking

*   **Meaning**: If a [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] *doesn't* ask your compensation expectation, you are almost certainly in the "no" pile, as they've already determined you're not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. If they *do* ask, it's a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Discussing Salary Range

*   **Meaning**: If your expectation is a little higher than their range, a [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] might say, "The salary range that we are scoping for this role is between this and this. So it's a little bit lower than what you're expecting. Would you be open to that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Answer honestly. If the difference is significant (e.g., more than $10,000-$15,000), they might say, "This position is scoped a little lower than you're expecting, and if you don't mind, I'll give you a call when I have a more enriched role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This is their way of saying they can't afford you, and it's likely a position you wouldn't want anyway due to the low pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### "Do you have any questions for me?"

*   **Meaning**: When this question is asked, the interview is effectively over, and the [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] has usually already decided whether to move you forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. No amount of "selling" at this point will change their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It's mainly a formality or a chance for you to gather information for your own decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Selling You the Job

*   **Meaning**: If the [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] tries to "sell" you the job and get you excited, it means they think you're a potentially great fit and they will certainly send you to the [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | hiring manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. They are already trying to pre-sell you for a potential offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Quick Interview Wrap-up

*   **Meaning**: If the interview wraps up in 10 to 15 minutes, you are likely not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Most [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiters]] know within five to seven minutes whether a candidate is a decent fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Make your best first impression right from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### "We've had a lot of interest... we just started interviewing... we'll be back to you whenever we've completed all of our interviews."

*   **Meaning**: This statement usually means you are not moving on in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A particularly good candidate would be pre-sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Introducing the Hiring Manager and Scheduling a Meeting

*   **Meaning**: If the [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] introduces the [[challenges_in_hiring_and_recruitment | hiring manager]] and tells you they are putting you on their calendar, it's a very strong sign that you are moving forward in the interviewing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

By understanding these cues, job applicants can better navigate the interview process and gauge their standing with the [[Role of the recruiter in job offer negotiations | recruiter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

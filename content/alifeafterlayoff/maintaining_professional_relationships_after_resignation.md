When resigning from a job, it is crucial to maintain [[professionalism in workplace interactions | professionalism]] and leave gracefully to preserve your [[professionalism in workplace interactions | professional reputation]] and future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This approach ensures you don't burn bridges and can leverage your network in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Why Professionalism Matters

Leaving a job in a disruptive manner, such as storming out, kicking over a computer, or telling the employer "take this job and shove it," is the wrong way to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Such actions will likely render you ineligible for rehire, burn all your bridges, and could even lead to legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This negative exit affects not only the employer but also former colleagues, who may perceive you as a risk or "loose cannon" and be unwilling to refer you for future positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The short-term satisfaction of a dramatic exit is fleeting, while the damage to your [[professional communication in interviews | professional reputation]] can be long-lasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Key Steps for a Graceful Exit

### Keep Your Job Search Confidential
It is highly recommended not to tell anyone, especially work friends, about your job search until you have a confirmed start date with a new employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Rumors can spread, potentially putting you in a difficult situation if your current employer finds out prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It's always better to find a job when you already have one, and to leave on your own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Secure Your New Opportunity
Before giving notice, ensure all pre-employment requirements for your new job are complete, such as drug screens, background checks, and reference checks, and that you have a confirmed start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. There have been instances where offers were pulled due to background check issues after a candidate had already given notice to their current employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Waiting until you have a "green light" from the new company is the safest approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Inform Your Boss First
Once your new job is confirmed, schedule a face-to-face meeting or a video call with your boss to deliver your resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Avoid sending an email or text message for this sensitive conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. It is crucial that your boss hears the news directly from you, not through the "grapevine" or rumor mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Professional Resignation Conversation
Keep your resignation conversation concise and professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Simply state that you have received another opportunity that is the best move for your family and thank them for the time and opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Do not elaborate on negative reasons for leaving, such as a bad boss or a toxic environment, as this can escalate emotions and serves no constructive purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Your decision should already be made, and entertaining [[strategies_for_job_resignation_and_counter_offers | counter offers]] should not be an option if you are truly ready to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Coordinate Communication with Colleagues and Clients
After informing your boss, ask for their guidance on when and how to inform your coworkers, clients, or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Following the proper protocol leaves a positive impression and avoids surprises or animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Recognize that your departure will create a void, increasing workloads for your colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Address them with grace and appreciation, acknowledging their potential increased responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### [[Importance of giving notice when resigning | Give Two Weeks' Notice]]
Always provide at least two weeks' notice as a professional courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This allows you to tie up loose ends and enables the company to begin preparing for your transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. While there's no legal requirement, it's a courtesy to your coworkers and boss, preventing them from having to scramble to cover your work and properly support customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Personal Thank Yous and Networking
Before your last day, personally contact individuals who were instrumental in your career growth at the company, whether they trained you, provided guidance, or offered opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Thank them personally and ask to connect with them on professional networking platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Building and maintaining these professional networks is vital for future career opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### On Your Last Day
On your last day, if possible, gather your local team for a brief huddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Keep your reasons for leaving high-level and positive, focusing on a "better opportunity" or it being "better for your family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Express gratitude for the team and the opportunity to grow your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Avoid trashing the company or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Leave the Door Open
Always strive to leave an organization on good terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. You never know if circumstances might lead you to consider returning to the company or working with former colleagues or bosses at a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Maintaining good terms with former bosses is also essential for future references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Your "employment brand" is reflected in how you treat people when you leave, and it will follow you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

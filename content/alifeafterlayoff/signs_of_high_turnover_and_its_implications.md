[[High turnover rates | High turnover rates]] are a definitive indicator that an organization is facing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>. While some [[employee_turnover_and_company_stability | employee turnover and company stability]] is a natural and healthy part of any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>, an unusually high rate, either company-wide or within a specific department, often points to underlying issues that can make a workplace [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:34">[02:07:34]</a>.

## Types of High Turnover

Turnover can be categorized into two main types:

### Voluntary Turnover

This refers to employees choosing to leave the company on their own accord, rather than being terminated or asked to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>.

**Signs of High Voluntary Turnover:**
*   A "revolving door" where new employees consistently join and quickly depart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>.
*   The best companies maintain a turnover rate significantly lower than the standard 22% across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:03">[02:34:03]</a>.

**Implications of High Voluntary Turnover:**
*   People generally do not leave excellent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:44">[02:23:44]</a>. In healthy environments, if an employee feels their growth is stagnant, the company typically works with them to find new opportunities within the organization or a different department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:07">[02:28:07]</a>.
*   It's a strong indicator that something is wrong within the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>.
*   For potential employees, observing high voluntary turnover is a critical red flag that should prompt further investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>.

### Involuntary Turnover

This type of turnover occurs when the company initiates the separation, such as through termination, firing, or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

**Signs of High Involuntary Turnover:**
*   A company or department known for terminating employees for minor infractions or for failing to meet extremely difficult metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:08">[03:30:08]</a>.
*   Companies that exhibit "knee-jerk reactions" to market fluctuations, often laying off employees with the expectation of easily recalling them later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.
*   Bosses who dismiss employees "on a whim" for not meeting unreasonable standards or expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

**Implications of High Involuntary Turnover:**
*   It signals an inept management team or, at worst, leadership that demonstrates a lack of care for its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:39">[03:50:39]</a>.
*   Such environments are inherently unstable and are considered [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | toxic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:24">[04:08:24]</a>. Employees should seek organizations that truly value their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:24">[03:58:24]</a>.

## Assessing Turnover and Its Connection to Workplace Health

To [[assessing_company_turnover_rates | assess company turnover rates]] and understand the underlying [[reasons_for_employee_dissatisfaction | reasons for employee dissatisfaction]]:
*   **Ask During Interviews:** Inquire why a position is open during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>. This is a crucial step to "vet opportunities" before joining a new organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:08">[02:58:08]</a>.
*   **Check Reviews:** Look for common themes in company reviews on platforms like Glassdoor or Indeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:44">[03:04:44]</a>. While reviews often come from disgruntled employees, consistent complaints about leadership, unrealistic expectations, or poor work-life balance are telling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:22">[05:25:22]</a>.
*   **Listen and Observe:** Pay attention to information gleaned from casual conversations within departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>.
*   **Overarching Themes:** When reviewing external feedback, look for consistent patterns rather than isolated incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:24">[05:51:24]</a>. Good companies actively use exit reviews to identify such trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>.

High turnover, whether voluntary or involuntary, is often linked to broader [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | signs of a toxic workplace]], including:
*   **Ever-changing targets:** When goals are constantly shifting, it creates a frustrating employment experience where employees can never achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:12">[04:19:12]</a>.
*   **Poor online reviews:** These reviews can highlight issues like management practices, compensation, benefits, and work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:04">[05:01:04]</a>.
*   **"Win at all costs" mentality:** Organizations that prioritize profit above all else, often engaging in shady practices or treating employees poorly, exhibit a toxic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:04">[06:16:04]</a>. This suggests employees are not valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of work-life balance:** Companies that demand excessive hours (e.g., routinely 60+ hours a week) are likely understaffed or overworking their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:37">[07:07:37]</a>. A good boss respects personal time, not calling during nights, weekends, or vacations for non-urgent matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:10">[07:35:10]</a>.
*   **Dishonesty:** A company that doesn't uphold its core values or has dishonest leaders and coworkers who fabricate situations to their advantage indicates a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:04">[08:22:04]</a>. Such an environment puts employees at risk of being unfairly blamed or undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:06">[08:56:06]</a>.
*   **Co-workers going behind your back:** A lack of direct communication and a tendency for co-workers to report issues directly to a boss without attempting to resolve them first erodes trust and signals a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:34">[09:07:34]</a>.
*   **Excessive gossip:** While some gossip is common, excessive or toxic gossip can lead to HR issues and negatively impact an employee's career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:02">[09:48:02]</a>.
*   **Bad bosses:** Often, [[employee_dissatisfaction and career changes | employee dissatisfaction and career changes]] stem from [[signs of low quality employers | signs of low quality employers]] being manifested through a bad boss, as people frequently quit bosses, not jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:04">[10:57:04]</a>.

## Next Steps for Employees

If you observe [[high_turnover_rates | high turnover rates]] or other [[signs_of_a_toxic_workplace | signs of a toxic workplace]], it's essential to determine if the issue is systematic within the company or localized to a specific department or individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. If it's a company-wide problem that cannot be easily resolved, employees should consider their career best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:11">[11:28:11]</a>. Recognizing these signs should prompt a reevaluation of your employment and potentially exploring [[signs_to_quit_your_job | signs that you should quit your job]] and an exit strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

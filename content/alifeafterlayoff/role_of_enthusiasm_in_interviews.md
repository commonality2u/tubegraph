A significant mistake job candidates make is not exhibiting enough enthusiasm during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Impact of Low Enthusiasm
If a candidate presents with low energy and a lack of enthusiasm for the position, it gives the impression that they do not truly desire the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. When considering candidates, a hiring manager would prefer someone who is energetic and excited about the opportunity over someone who appears bored or uninterested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Hiring managers actively seek enthusiasm in candidates because it is seen as infectious and indicative of a positive, upbeat team member who is ready to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Enthusiasm and [[Importance of Interview Preparation|Preparation]]
While [[Importance of Interview Preparation|preparation]] is crucial, enthusiasm also plays a vital role in making a strong impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Practicing Enthusiasm
For individuals who are introverted and for whom enthusiasm may not come naturally, it is a skill that can be practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Practicing in front of a mirror can help work on increasing energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Connection to [[Asking Questions to Interviewers|Asking Questions]]
A common mistake that contributes to a perceived lack of engagement is candidates not [[Asking Questions to Interviewers|asking any questions]] during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If a candidate progresses through multiple rounds of interviews and meets with key stakeholders, including the hiring manager, without asking questions about the role's contribution to the department or specific objectives, they will be seen as disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Interviews are a two-way street, where candidates should also be interviewing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Being truly passionate about one's career implies being selective about accepted roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Coming to an interview with good questions to ask about the culture and role fit will impress hiring teams and lead them to view the candidate as a potentially very engaged employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

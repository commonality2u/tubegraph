Navigating the job market and interviews can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, by understanding common "red flags" from potential employers and implementing effective strategies, job seekers can attract high-quality opportunities and make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Identifying Low-Quality Employers

Employers often reveal "tells" that indicate a low-quality opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Listening for these signs during an interview can help a job seeker discern whether to continue with the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Red Flag Interview Questions

Be cautious if an interviewer asks any of the following questions, as they may indicate a problematic workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>:

*   **"How many unplanned absences did you have in the past year?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
    *   This question suggests the company may be overly particular about attendance policies, possibly due to past attendance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It could indicate an inflexible workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Ask the interviewer what their expectation is for unplanned absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If they indicate strict policies, it might be a sign of a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **"What's your minimum acceptable salary?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
    *   This question aims to determine how cheaply they can hire you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, suggesting a lack of flexibility and a tendency to lowball candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It may indicate future struggles in maintaining a competitive salary or securing promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **"Will you be committed to staying at least two years in this role?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
    *   This is often a sign of a turnover issue within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, implying people are leaving quickly due to a cultural problem or bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **"Have you ever been fired?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    *   This question is generally not the employer's business and focuses on past situations that may not reflect future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Redirect the question to focus on future capabilities and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If the interviewer probes further or reacts negatively, it might be best to withdraw your candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Accusations of exaggerating or embellishing your resume** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    *   Assuming your resume is accurate, such accusations indicate an employer who doesn't trust you, or worse, assumes everyone is lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This points to a toxic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **"What's your biggest failure so far in your career?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>
    *   Often a trap question, focusing on failures may lead to the employer using your answer as a bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While intended to learn how you overcome adversity, there are better ways to phrase it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** If you must answer, focus briefly on the failure and then emphasize how you overcame the adversity to make it a positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Asking about availability for off-shifts or weekends for a standard role** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>
    *   This suggests you'll likely be working involuntary overtime, indicating a poor work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Push back to get clear expectations on true work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Asking about availability to come on-site for a remote job** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
    *   If regular on-site presence is expected, it's not a truly remote job; it's a hybrid position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. If pitched as fully remote, be aware it might eventually become 100% in-office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This is a significant red flag for those seeking genuinely remote roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **"How do you deal with rude co-workers or managers?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
    *   This question implies that the workplace may have a difficult or rude internal customer base, or even a rude manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, indicating a definite cultural issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Lack of opportunity for the candidate to ask questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
    *   An interview is a two-way street; you should be assessing the company as much as they are assessing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. If the interviewer dominates the conversation or takes offense to your questions, it suggests they believe they are superior and shouldn't be assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, which is a major red flag for the company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Holistic Assessment
One or two red flag questions alone don't necessarily mean a company is poor quality, but they serve as additional data points to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Always ask good probing questions to ensure you understand what you're getting into before accepting a job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

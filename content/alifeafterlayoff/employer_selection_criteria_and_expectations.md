Securing employment in today's job market can feel challenging, with many job seekers feeling that [[employer_hiring_strategies_and_ethics | employer requirements]] are out of touch with reality. This perception is supported by the existence of "hidden job requirements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These unspoken criteria, often known only internally by companies, significantly influence the [[recruitment_strategies_and_candidate_profiles | recruitment process]] and can lead to frustration for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Origin of Hidden Requirements

Hidden job requirements typically originate from the hiring manager or the hiring team responsible for a particular role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. When a job requisition is opened, the hiring manager provides recruiters with a list of "must-haves" (requirements) and "nice-to-haves" (preferred qualifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

While "requirements" are usually straightforward—like years of experience or core technical expertise for a specific field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>—the "preferred" qualifications are often where [[hiring_manager_biases_in_recruitment | hiring manager biases]] become evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Recruiters then take these guidelines to market, although a good recruiter should challenge unrealistic expectations to avoid eliminating qualified candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, this pushback doesn't always occur, especially with less experienced recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Case Study: Leaked Internal Selection Guidelines

An instance of these hidden requirements becoming public occurred when a recruiter accidentally emailed a candidate their internal selection guidelines for a software development role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These guidelines, which were not part of the public job posting, revealed extreme and often unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Specific "What We're Looking For" Criteria

The leaked internal memo detailed several stringent criteria:

*   **Educational Background**
    *   University graduate with a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science from a "top program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   Examples of "top programs" included MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Caltech, University of Illinois, and University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   A special exception *might* be made for a 4.0 graduate from other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Experience Level**
    *   Candidates must have 4 to 10 years of software development experience; less than 4 years, even for a "genius," would make them unsuitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Technical Skills**
    *   Expertise in modern JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   Knowledge of modern tech like Kotlin, AI, and machine learning was also desired, indicating a need for broad experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Employment History**
    *   Demonstrated "longevity in role," requiring 2+ years in each position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   Job hoppers were not a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   Being laid off due to company closure or departmental layoffs also made a candidate unsuitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Company Background**
    *   Significant experience in "notable startups" (e.g., those backed by Y Combinator or Sequoia Capital) was required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   Candidates who had *only* worked for large companies, even prominent ones like Google or Facebook, would be rejected because they were believed to lack understanding of startup coding environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Demographic/Citizenship**
    *   Diversity hires (e.g., Black, female) were considered a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   Candidates must be a US citizen, US permanent resident (green card holder), or a Canadian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. No visa sponsorships were accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> (this last point is noted as fairly common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>).
*   **Entrepreneurial Experience**
    *   Bonus points for being a founding engineer or having founder experience, meaning they had started their own tech firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### "What to Avoid" Criteria

The memo also explicitly listed types of candidates the hiring manager wished to avoid:

*   **Visa Candidates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>
*   **Career Contractors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   **Job Hoppers** (those with frequent short stints) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
*   **Coding Boot Camp Graduates** (e.g., Full Stack Academy, Hacked Reactor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>
*   **Consulting Backgrounds** (those who worked for IT software development firms rather than product-producing companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   **Experience Limited to Big Companies** (e.g., Uber, Intel) unless paired with startup experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Fake Profiles** (a legitimate concern given the rise of AI-generated resumes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **"Scarlet-Lettered" Companies:** Candidates who had *ever* worked at specific companies like Intel, Cisco, HP, Tata, Infosys, or Dell were blacklisted and would "never be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Impact on Job Seekers and Recruiters

These hidden, often unrealistic criteria make the [[candidate_experience_during_the_hiring_process | hiring process]] incredibly frustrating for job seekers, confirming their perception that [[understanding_job_expectations_and_compensation | employer expectations]] are out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. For recruiters, such a detailed "wish list" severely limits the candidate pool, making it extremely difficult to find a suitable match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. A competent recruiter should ideally push back on such demands or even consider dropping the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

While this specific example is extreme, the speaker notes that such hidden requirements are common in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Many companies operate with unlisted criteria that job seekers will never know about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Navigating Unrealistic Employer Expectations

For job seekers encountering such rigid and unrealistic [[employer_expectations_vs_actual_skills_of_gen_z | employer expectations]], it's important to remember that "it's them and not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Instead of losing sleep over these impossible standards, focus on presenting your qualifications clearly with a clean resume, engaging in targeted networking, and demonstrating your fit through portfolios or GitHub profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

Ultimately, job seekers can reclaim control in their careers by choosing not to apply for jobs with such unreasonable demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. If companies don't receive applications for positions with impossible requirements, they will eventually be forced to adjust their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

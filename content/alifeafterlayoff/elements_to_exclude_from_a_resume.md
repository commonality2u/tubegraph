From: [[alifeafterlayoff]] <br/> 

When crafting a resume, certain elements should be left out to ensure it is [[importance_of_a_clean_and_concise_resume | clean, concise]], and effective in helping you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Avoiding these [[common_mistakes_in_resume_writing | common mistakes]] can prevent negative judgments and improve your chances of being noticed by recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## Visual Distractions

### Bright Graphics or Colors
Avoid using bright graphics, charts, clip art, or excessive colorful elements on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The goal is to keep your resume [[importance_of_a_clean_and_concise_resume | clean and concise]] to avoid distracting the interviewer from assessing your background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Exception
> If you are in a creative field, such as an art director or graphic designer, including unique and splashy graphics might be expected to showcase your creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. For most other career types, keep it simple and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Simple colors like blues, blacks, or magenta for a job title are generally acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### Infographics for Skill Proficiency
Do not use infographics that demonstrate skill proficiency, such as bars indicating a certain level of expertise (e.g., "3 out of 10") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This can unintentionally highlight a weakness in a skill important to the employer, potentially eliminating you from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. It's preferable to allow the employer to assess your skills during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Always be vague in this regard, but never [[things_you_should_never_lie_about_on_your_resume | lie]] about your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Formatting Issues

### Columns
Avoid using multiple columns on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) typically parse left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. While many ATS systems are sophisticated, some may struggle to read columns, potentially making skills listed in other columns invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This can severely limit your discoverability if recruiters perform Boolean searches on the ATS at a later date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The simplest solution is to remove columns altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Personal Information

### Photographs of Yourself
In the US and North America, it is generally advised to avoid including a photograph of yourself on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Recruiters might assume you are not US-based if a photo is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. However, if you are applying in a country where photographs are customary on resumes, follow the local tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

### Personal Identifiers
Exclude any personal identifiers that could lead to non-work related judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>
*   Race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>
*   Creed or color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>
*   Marital status or family details (e.g., "married with two kids") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>

Omitting these details prevents potential discrimination by unscrupulous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This advice is primarily US-specific; in other countries, different traditions may apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

### Unprofessional Email Addresses
Ensure your email address is professional and neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Avoid email addresses created during college years or those with nicknames that could lead to judgment (e.g., "Iusuallyparty@yahoo.com") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Create a clean Gmail account using your full name if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### Full Addresses
Providing your full street address is no longer necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Only your city and state are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This prevents potential discrimination based on commute distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Even for remote work, recruiters still need to know your city and state for time zone considerations and tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## Content Irrelevance

### Irrelevant or Outdated Work History
Exclude work history that is not relevant to the job you're applying for or is older than 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Employers typically focus on your last 10, or even 5, years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Skills from older roles may no longer be relevant due to market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Unless a senior executive position specifically requires 20 years of experience, a lengthy work history isn't necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

### Industry-Specific Jargon or Acronyms
Avoid using industry-specific jargon, internal job titles, or acronyms that a recruiter or hiring manager outside your company might not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This specialized language is too specific and hinders your discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Make your resume as clear as possible to increase your chances of getting hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

### Excessive Education Details
Avoid providing too much detail about your degrees or college courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. Simply stating the college and degree type is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

#### Minor Degrees
Employers generally do not weigh minor degrees heavily, so don't use up valuable space detailing all the courses studied for a minor, unless you are entry-level and need the extra keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

#### Grade Point Average (GPA)
If you are more than three years out of college, do not include your GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Employers typically do not care about it, and it's not a common question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. If you are entry-level or have less than three years of experience, keeping your GPA is acceptable, but plan to remove it once you gain more experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

#### Internships
If you have been in the workforce for longer than three years, remove internships from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. Internships are not typically counted as total years of experience and may be seen as mere "vanity stats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

### References or "References Available Upon Request"
Do not list actual references or include the phrase "references available upon request" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. Recruiters will ask for references if they need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>, and generally, employers are moving away from routinely checking references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Assume they are available without explicitly stating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

### Salary History or Expectations
Never include your previous salary history or expected compensation on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. Disclosing this information can lock you into a lower salary or open you up to a lowball offer, even if the employer has a healthier salary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Salary discussions will occur during the first-round interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

### Universal or Generic Skills
Avoid listing universal or generic skills that are widely assumed, such as proficiency in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. These skills are standard for professional-level jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Instead, save valuable space for more impactful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. Similarly, avoid listing "leadership" or "organization skills" directly; it's better to demonstrate these competencies through bullet points detailing your achievements and responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

### Generic or Cliche Jargon
Do not use generic or cliche phrases like "team player" or "fast learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. Such phrases are meaningless on a resume because no one would admit to being the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. These phrases do not add value and waste valuable space that could be used for more impactful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

By following these [[strategies_for_effective_resume_writing | strategies]] and avoiding the aforementioned elements, you can significantly improve your resume's effectiveness and increase your chances of securing job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. For a job application, it's crucial to optimize your resume for recruitment teams and [[customizing_resumes_for_specific_roles | customize]] it to give you the best chance of getting noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

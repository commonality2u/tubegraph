Quitting a job, while sometimes tempting due to workplace issues like poor leadership, lack of respect, toxic environments, underpayment, or unfulfilling work, is often not the best immediate solution in the current job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Many individuals seeking career coaching initially look for clarity on their current situation, often hoping to quit, but this can be a detrimental move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The advice for many is to avoid quitting unless absolutely necessary, and to instead approach career changes with a well-thought-out strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Current Job Market Realities

The job market today is significantly different from the "heyday for job seekers" in 2021 and most of 2022, where companies were "throwing money left and right to recruit talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Key challenges in the current market include:
*   **High Competition** The job market "isn't really that good right now" and is "extremely competitive," with companies often receiving "thousands of candidates for a single job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Replacing Jobs** Many individuals who have quit find it "very difficult" and time-consuming to replace their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Even marketable professionals with strong backgrounds are struggling to get interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Shift from Remote Work** The trend towards highly coveted remote and hybrid positions has diminished, with companies increasingly requiring returns to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This has led to many who took remote roles during the "great resignation" now regretting their choices as mandates change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Economic Cooldown and Salary Resets** Signs of an "economic cooldown" are appearing, leading to fewer lucrative job offers and companies resetting salaries, making it difficult to find significant salary increases by jumping ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **The "Great Regret"** A new phenomenon, dubbed "The Great Regret," sees people who participated in the "great resignation" now feeling "stuck in place" or regretting their decisions to quit impulsively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## When Quitting Is Justified

While the general recommendation is caution, there are legitimate reasons to quit a job. These include truly toxic situations where an individual is asked to do something illegal or unethical, or is experiencing bonafide harassment or a hostile work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. In such cases, finding a different employer is advisable, but one must do so with "eyes wide open" to the current labor market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## The [[importance_of_being_proactive_in_your_career | Importance of Proactive Career Management]]

Instead of a "knee-jerk reaction" like quitting, individuals should adopt a [[career management and planning | strategic approach to their career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This involves:

*   **Acting like the CEO of your career** To make smart decisions and reclaim control, individuals need to manage their careers actively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Strategic Preparation** If gainfully employed, "buckle down a little bit right now" and focus on making your resume "shine" to compete effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Seeking the Right Opportunity** Focus on jumping for the "right opportunity," not just a slight pay increase or due to minor dissatisfaction with a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Stability** In the coming months, "stability and finding a job and or an industry that has a degree of growth and strength is going to be the most important thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **Targeted Networking** Leverage the power of LinkedIn for "targeted networking" to potentially "skip the recruiter altogether," which is often the preferable method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

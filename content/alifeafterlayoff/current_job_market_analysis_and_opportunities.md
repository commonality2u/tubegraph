## Resume Best Practices for the [[job_market_and_career_strategies | Job Market]]

### Avoid Graphic Designer Templates
Resumes bought from platforms like Etsy or Canva are often designed by graphic designers whose goal is to make a pretty resume, not necessarily a functional one for applicant tracking systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These templates can make job seekers essentially invisible to recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Recruiters use Boolean searches on ATS systems to find candidates who have applied to similar positions in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. A non-ATS compliant resume will hinder discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Indicators of Non-ATS Compliant Resumes
If you need to perform a lot of manual data entry after uploading your resume, such as repeatedly inputting your address or phone number because the system isn't pulling information correctly, it's a good sign your resume is not ATS compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Preferred Resume Style
A clean and simple resume without excessive graphics or columns is recommended for maximum discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Objective Statements vs. Career Summaries
While objective statements are generally considered pointless, a career summary can be beneficial to correctly brand or profile a candidate to a recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Recruiters may not have time to quickly read through an entire resume to understand a candidate's profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### The Importance of Resume Customization
Customizing your resume for each specific job application is the single most impactful action a job seeker can take to increase their chances of getting a callback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Having multiple versions of your resume, especially for different career verticals, is recommended to niche down and be specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

If you are applying for job after job and not getting results, assuming you are reasonably qualified, it is almost always a resume issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Application Process Challenges

### Annoying Application Questions
Some companies include "cute" questions like "tell us a joke" in applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. While not disqualifying, these can be aggravating for job seekers, adding anxiety and extra steps to an already lengthy process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Assessment Tests
Requiring assessment tests (e.g., personality profiles, Wonderlic tests) at the application level creates a terrible candidate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Companies that mandate these tests are not valuing the candidate's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Some recruiters would abandon an application that requires an assessment test upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Effective Job Search Strategies

### Direct Applications on Company Websites
Applying directly on an employer's website often provides the most accurate and up-to-date list of job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Job boards may not always accurately remove positions once they are filled or cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Applying directly also means the application eventually has to go through the company's system anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Searching by Job Title vs. Experience Level
When searching for jobs, it is more effective to search by job title than by the designated experience level (e.g., entry-level, mid-tier, executive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Machine learning and ATS systems can sometimes incorrectly classify job postings, listing senior manager roles as "entry-level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Therefore, job seekers should broaden their search across all experience categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

It is also common to see job descriptions requesting more years of experience in a technology than it has existed, which is often due to recruiters or overzealous hiring managers who don't fully understand the technical requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This should not deter candidates from pursuing the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## Experiment Results and Insights

### Application Response Rate
The experiment involved applying to 1,003 jobs and received 259 interview requests, along with 47 outright rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This represents a 27-28% response rate, which is considered very good, especially for entry-level positions, even with a non-customized resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This high response rate suggests companies are currently desperate for labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

### Unanswered Applications
Approximately 650 applications received no response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Reasons for this include jobs being filled, candidates not being a good fit, or employers sitting on resumes for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Recruiters are often overloaded, handling 30-50 requisitions (compared to an ideal 5-15 for sourcing roles), leading to delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. A typical corporate recruiter should handle about 5-7 requisitions for technical roles and up to 25-30 for high-volume, low-input roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

While a 10-day wait for a response might indicate disinterest from the employer, it's not a definitive sign of rejection, as companies may be in an interview process with other candidates and could revisit previous applications later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

### Resume Performance Comparison
Resume B, which had a different layout or content, performed better than Resume A. Resume A received a 22% response rate, while Resume B received around a 30% response rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Job Seeker's Market

The entry-level [[recent_trends_in_the_labor_market_and_employment | job market]] appears to be strong, confirming it is currently a job seeker's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. This is an opportune time for job seekers to explore new roles if they are unsatisfied with their current situation (e.g., underpaid, overworked, burned out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

It is advisable for job seekers to "put their toe in the water" to see what other opportunities are available, as this favorable market condition may not last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. The pendulum of the job market is expected to swing back, especially with potential economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

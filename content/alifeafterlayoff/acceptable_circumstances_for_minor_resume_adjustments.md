In a difficult job search, it can be tempting to embellish or "flub things a little bit" on a resume to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. While outright lying is generally not condoned, there are certain "white lies" or strategic adjustments that a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience suggests might be acceptable to [[Strategies for improving resume visibility without lying | optimize chances of getting noticed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The goal is to "manipulate" information to position oneself advantageously, rather than fabricating facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. A resume often gets only a five-second glance from a recruiter, so making it immediately relevant is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Situations Where Minor Adjustments May Be Acceptable

### Job Titles
If your current job title is proprietary and doesn't match common market titles for similar roles, it is acceptable to change it on your resume to align with what companies are commonly looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Recruiters often adjust their job titles to match the broader market to attract more candidates, and job seekers can do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Recruiters typically won't call your former company to verify the exact proprietary title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This adjustment helps your resume be more discoverable via common keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Employer Name (Contracting Positions)
If you work for a third-party agency but your day-to-day work is solely for a specific "name brand" client company, and you passed their technical bar for entry, it's generally acceptable to list the client company as your employer on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This is especially true if you are integrated into their team and use their email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. However, it's important to clarify the contracting arrangement later in the hiring process, especially if background checks are conducted, to avoid potential hiccups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Location
If you are actively planning to relocate to a new area for job opportunities, you can state on your resume that you already live there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This can increase the number of phone calls from local recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

However, be prepared to:
*   Bear the cost of relocation yourself, as springing relocation assistance needs on a company later is considered unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   Cover any travel costs for on-site interviews if the company is only budgeting for local candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   Potentially forfeit relocation benefits that might have been offered if you had been transparent about your current location from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

### Dates of Employment
Instead of specific months and days, using only years for employment dates can help "massage" your resume to appear cleaner, especially if there are gaps or frequent job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. While this doesn't explicitly lie, it makes the specific duration less obvious at first glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. An astute recruiter may ask for specific dates during an interview, at which point honesty is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

### Skills
If a job description lists a preferred skill that is easily and quickly learnable (e.g., using Google Docs if you know Microsoft Word), it may be acceptable to list it even if you don't fully possess it yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[00:11:29]</a>. The key is that you must be able to acquire and apply the skill functionally by your start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[00:11:34]</a>. This does not apply to complex skills like programming languages that require significant time to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Reasons for Leaving a Position
It's not advisable to explicitly advertise on your resume that you were fired, laid off, or quit a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. If asked why you left a position on an application, consider leaving it blank or stating "better opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. While you shouldn't lie if directly asked in an interview, openly stating you were fired on a resume can lead to immediate disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. The aim is to get the initial call so you can explain the situation rather than being automatically moved to the "no" pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

## When to Never Lie on a Resume
An employment application is a legal document, and falsification can lead to termination or rescinded offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. Areas where lying is unacceptable include:

*   **Employer You've Never Worked For**: Do not fabricate an employer, especially if a specific company type (e.g., "FANG" company) is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. You will be exposed during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
*   **References**: Never ask a friend to impersonate a former boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. It's better to honestly explain a difficult relationship with a previous supervisor and provide alternative references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.
*   **Specific Dates of Employment**: Do not add extra years to your employment history to cover gaps or extend tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. This is outright falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.
*   **Major Skills**: Do not claim skills, especially complex ones like programming languages, that you cannot easily acquire and functionally apply before starting the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.
*   **Education**: Never lie about possessing a degree or certification you do not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. Education claims are verified during background checks, and falsification will lead to a lost offer and potential blacklisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.
*   **Criminal Record**: Do not omit or lie about a criminal record, particularly felonies, if specifically asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. Background checks will reveal this, and it's better to be honest and explain than to be exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.
*   **Years of Experience**: Do not inflate your years of experience to meet job requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. This will be exposed during interviews, and even if you get the job, you'll be set up to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. It's more beneficial to find a role appropriate for your actual experience level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

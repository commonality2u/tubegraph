The concept of a traditional career, where an individual selects a path at age 18, dedicates 40 years to an employer, collects a pension, and retires into the sunset, is considered "completely dead" in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This long-standing model, which valued loyalty above all else from both employee and employer, no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Traditional Career Model (Past)

Many recall an era when grandparents and parents worked long, traditional careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Entering the workforce at 18 often involved landing a first job with ease, sometimes through nepotism or by simply submitting a basic resume to the "Personnel department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These careers often spanned 45 fulfilling years, culminating in a great pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Employers generally treated employees with a high degree of loyalty, rarely engaging in constant layoffs, and even reassigning individuals to different departments if they weren't excelling in a specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to the Collapse

Several key shifts, many linked to technological advancements and evolving corporate mentalities, have led to the demise of the traditional career:

### Decline of Employer Loyalty and Short-Term Mentality

Today's workplace operates on a "what have you done for me lately" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Companies are primarily focused on the next news cycle or earnings report, meaning past successes don't guarantee future job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This shift is partially attributed to an "overly connected" world with instant data, accelerating decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Globalization and Online Hiring Platforms

Hiring was once a highly localized process, with individuals typically working for major employers within their geographic region, often facilitated by personal connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, the modern global economy, propelled by the [[the_impact_of_remote_work_and_modern_hiring_platforms | rise of job boards and LinkedIn]], has drastically changed this landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Job seekers can now apply for thousands of jobs across the globe from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This has led to significantly fiercer competition, with job applicants competing against thousands of others worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Accelerating Layoff Cycles

Companies now exhibit a short-term mentality, leading to frequent cycles of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Historically, layoffs followed economic patterns, with companies bloating during expansion and then "right-sizing" after major events like the dot-com bubble burst (early 2000s) or the subprime real estate bubble (2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. While these cycles used to occur approximately every 10 years, they appear to be shortening and accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 triggered another wave of right-sizing, leading to an employment market that may never return to its previous "normalcy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Unlike past generations, who were less susceptible to constant layoffs, modern employees face a constant threat to job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Shift in Retirement Plans

Another significant change is the decoupling of employer commitment to employee retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Defined Benefits:** In the past, employers commonly funded an employee's entire retirement through pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Defined Contribution:** During the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, there was a shift to defined contribution plans, where the burden of retirement funding was transferred to the employee, with employers often only providing a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Long Vesting Periods:** Companies often impose long vesting periods (e.g., four or more years) for employees to claim matched funds, meaning if an employee is laid off before vesting, they lose the employer's contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This further reduces employer commitment and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_job_market_changes | Disruptive Technologies like AI]]

The [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_job_market_changes | rise of disruptive technologies like AI]] is a profound factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While disruptive technologies have always existed, artificial intelligence is considered the "most disruptive technology" to enter the workforce conversation, with the potential to displace millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This enables employers to further detach loyalty, as they may no longer need employees in the same capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Implications for the Modern Worker

As the traditional career model and employer loyalty become obsolete, the way individuals approach work is drastically changing and evolving quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

*   **Short-Term Assignments and Contract Work:** Expect to see a rise in short-term assignments and contract positions as employers seek to avoid the costs associated with full-time employees and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Job Hopping Becomes Less Taboo:** The frequent layoffs by companies make job hopping less of a stigma, as employees are often laid off before they can establish long tenures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Increased Self-Reliance for Retirement:** Employees can no longer rely on employers to fund their retirement, even through 401(k) matches, given the frequency of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This is particularly disruptive for those nearing the end of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. There are also discussions about moving the retirement age to 70 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Ultimately, these changes necessitate a strategic approach to careers, viewing oneself as a "free agent" and the "CEO of your career," rather than relying on an employer to look out for one's best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

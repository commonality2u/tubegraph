[[employee_burnout_and_boundaries | Employee burnout]] is a significant issue that can signal it's time to consider a job change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. It often arises when individuals are constantly overloaded or feeling overworked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Causes of Burnout

Several factors contribute to [[career_dissatisfaction_and_job_burnout | job burnout]]:
*   **Increased Workload** Due to the "great resignation" period, many people have exited the workforce, and companies struggle to replace talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This often results in the remaining employees being burdened with the work of two people, potentially requiring them to work 70-90 hours a week, which is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Hot Water for Companies** When companies face financial difficulties, they may be less equipped to backfill positions or offer competitive salaries, leading to increased workload for current employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This can lead to employees being "worked to the bone" without sufficient time for vacations or decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[worklife_balance_and_excessive_working_hours | Work-Life Balance]]** A company that fails to invest in its employees and pushes them to burnout demonstrates poor recognition of the need for a healthy [[worklife_balance_and_excessive_working_hours | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Stagnation and Lack of Development** Feeling stagnant in a role, not learning new skills, or being blocked from upward mobility can lead to burnout and a lack of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
*   **[[toxic_workplace_dynamics | Toxic Workplace Dynamics]]** Working in a [[effects_of_working_in_a_harmful_environment | harmful environment]] with a toxic boss or co-workers can severely impact an individual's mental state and overall well-being, directly contributing to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## Signs and Effects of Burnout

Recognizing the signs of burnout is crucial:

*   **Dread and Lack of Passion** A strong sense of dread about Monday mornings or feeling the "Sunday scaries" indicates a lack of engagement and passion for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. If going to work or logging in requires psyching yourself up, it's a clear sign of being in the wrong job type, company, or experiencing [[employee_burnout_and_boundaries | burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **"Quiet Quitting"** Finding it difficult to find motivation, doing less work, or producing less are indicators of burnout or a lack of passion, often referred to as "quiet quitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This situation is not sustainable long-term for the employee or the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Suffering Health** [[Impact of a toxic workplace on mental and physical health | One of the most severe effects of burnout]] is declining physical and mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. This can manifest as:
    *   Increased stress and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>
    *   Sudden weight gain or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>
    *   Changes in temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>
    *   Shifts in sleep cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>
    *   Needing medication due to work-related stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>

> "If you have to get onto medication because of your job that's a surefire sign that you should be looking at other opportunities because there's no positive outcome to that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

## When to Consider a Change

If experiencing [[employee_burnout_and_boundaries | burnout]], it's vital to consider other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This includes being proactive, such as updating a resume and exploring the job market, especially when a company shows signs of financial instability or if many co-workers are leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. It's also important to ask the right questions during interviews to ensure a new role won't lead to similar issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## General Job Search Approaches

Even while employed, individuals are considered "free agents" and should remain open to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. It is advised to "be selfish with your career" as nobody else will prioritize it for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Companies can lay off long-tenured employees with minimal notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Therefore, making smart career moves, such as leaving a bad boss, poor work culture, or a declining industry, is considered both the right and smart thing to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

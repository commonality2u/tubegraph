Bosses are reportedly firing Gen Z workers in record time, with several contributing factors cited by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A survey by intelligent.com in August found that one in six companies are hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The survey, which included 966 business leaders involved in hiring, revealed that while 75% of companies had hired Gen Z, a shocking 6 out of 10 admitted to having fired a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This suggests that employers are hiring Gen Z but are not tolerating what they perceive as a [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_employers | cultural mismatch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Employer Perceptions and Reasons for Termination

According to the study, 75% of companies reported at least some issues with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The most frequently cited reasons for these new hires not working out include:
*   Lack of motivation or initiative (50% of employers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Lack of [[perceptions_of_work_ethic_and_professionalism_in_gen_z | professionalism]] (nearly 46%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Lacking organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Lacking communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Challenges with feedback or not taking feedback well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Lack of relevant work experience, despite being entry-level positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Poor problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Insufficient technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Bad culture fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Difficulty working in a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

Other beliefs hiring managers hold about recent college graduates include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>:
*   Being entitled (65-70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, often wanting quick promotions and high salaries without demonstrated experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   Getting offended easily (65%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   Lack of work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Unprepared for the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Costing more to train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Surprisingly, lacking technological skills (28%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Specific behaviors observed include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>:
*   Inability to manage workload and unprofessionalism (1 in 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Often late to start work (about 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Often not dressing professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   Often late to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Too difficult to manage and handing in assignments late (17%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Cultural Disconnect and Lack of Preparation

Employers perceive a significant [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_employers | cultural disconnect]] between Gen Z and the [[challenges_in_the_modern_workplace | modern workplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Despite college degrees costing over $100,000, many universities are seen as not adequately preparing students for success in the working world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. There is a perceived lack of "transition training" to acclimate new hires to the realities of professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Impact of Social Media on Workplace Behavior

The rise of social media appears to contribute to [[perceptions_of_work_ethic_and_professionalism_in_gen_z | challenges in professionalism]] among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Employers actively check social media during the hiring process to ensure cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Instances of employees slacking off or complaining about work on platforms like TikTok are visible to employers and can lead to negative impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. A key issue cited is the refusal to separate from phones, leading to short attention spans and difficulty focusing on work for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Anecdotal Examples
*   A construction company owner in Southern California noted that young people often lack communication skills, critical thinking, motivation, attention to detail, and persistence, requiring constant supervision and being unable to put their phones down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   An emergency department nurse graduate was reportedly fired for not staying off her phone, ignoring assignments and patients, and texting friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. She chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, leading the department to stop hiring new nurse graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   A Gen Z accounting graduate was fired from one role for being constantly on her phone and from another for perceived bad attitude and inconsistent hours, despite her contract terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   Another Gen Z employee was terminated for repeated tardiness (e.g., 12, 21, 32 minutes late) and a "no call, no show" on her birthday, demonstrating a lack of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   A computer science graduate was fired after 15 months for "not doing anything," illustrating issues with "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Broader Context and Nuance

It's important to note that these issues are not universal to all Gen Z employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Many are highly motivated and driven, and the current negative [[perceptions_of_work_ethic_and_professionalism_in_gen_z | perception]] by employers is a shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

Gen Z has entered the workforce during one of the most tumultuous and [[challenges_in_the_current_job_market | difficult job markets ever]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Many college graduates must apply to thousands of positions to begin their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While employers are slow to hire and quick to fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, Gen Z is also helping to drive positive change in the workplace, particularly regarding work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. They are contributing to making the workplace healthier and more balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

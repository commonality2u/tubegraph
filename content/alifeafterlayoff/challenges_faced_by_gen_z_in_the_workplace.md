Bosses are reportedly firing Gen Z workers in record time due to a variety of reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A survey conducted in August by intelligent.com involved 966 business leaders involved in hiring decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The survey focused on their attitudes towards recent college graduates, also referred to as the Gen Z workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The findings revealed that 75% of companies had hired Gen Z employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, but a "somewhat shockingly" high 6 out of 10 admitted to having fired a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Overall, 75% of companies reported at least one issue with their recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Key Employer Concerns

The survey highlighted several frequently cited reasons for these issues and terminations:

*   **Lack of motivation or initiative:** Cited by 50% of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Lack of professionalism:** Cited by nearly 46% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of organizational skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Lack of communication skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Challenges with feedback/not taking feedback well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Lack of relevant work experience:** This is a point of disconnect, as entry-level positions often require 2-3 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Poor problem-solving skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Insufficient technical skills:** Surprisingly, 28% reported this, despite Gen Z growing up with modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Bad culture fit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Difficulty working in a team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Employers are quick to make moves on employees they perceive as a "cultural mismatch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, adopting a "slow to hire, quick to fire" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This trend is expected to continue as generational shifts occur in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Perceptions of Gen Z Attributes

Hiring managers also hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates:

*   **Entitlement:** Believed by 65-70% of hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This includes wanting quick promotions without demonstrated skill or experience, and demanding high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Easily offended:** Believed by 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of work ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Doesn't respond well to feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Unprepared for the workforce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Poor communication skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Lack of motivation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Costs more to train** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Additionally, 20% of hiring managers stated that Gen Z employees:
*   Often cannot manage the workload and are unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Are often late to start work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Often don't dress professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Furthermore, 19% observed that Gen Z employees often:
*   Don't use appropriate language at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Are late to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Seventeen percent believed that Gen Z employees are often too difficult to manage and hand in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This behavior, such as being late to meetings or work and submitting late assignments, is identified as a fast track to a performance improvement plan and termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Educational Disconnect

A significant concern is that recent graduates are entering the workplace after spending over $100,000 on college degrees, yet universities are seemingly not preparing them for success in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. There is a "huge cultural disconnect" and insufficient transition training to acclimate them to the working world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Impact on Hiring Practices

Due to these concerns, one in seven companies may avoid hiring any college graduates in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, and one in six hiring managers are hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. They believe that a stronger work ethic and a better attitude would make college graduates more hirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Case Studies and Anecdotal Evidence

Several anecdotes and social media observations support these findings:

*   **Social Media Usage:** Gen Z employees often struggle to put their phones down and focus on work, leading to short attention spans. The constant "dopamine hit" from social media is seen as a contributing factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Employers actively check social media during hiring to ensure cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Posting about slacking off at work on platforms like TikTok can negatively impact an employer's impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Professional Boundaries:** There's a perceived lack of separation between personal and professional life, particularly on social media, among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Avoiding political topics in the workplace is also a current "hot button" issue, with people getting fired for their political views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Real-world Examples:**
    *   A construction company owner in Southern California noted that young people under 30 often lack communication skills, critical thinking, motivation, and require constant supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. They also get frustrated easily and refuse to separate from their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
    *   An emergency department nurse graduate was fired for being constantly on her phone, ignoring assignments and patients, and texting friends about patients. She chose her phone over her job when given the ultimatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This led to the department stopping hiring new nurse graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
    *   A government IT professional reported that computer science graduates hired for entry-level IT admin positions did not last more than 6 months due to lack of focus, attention, communication skills, urgency, and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **TikTok Confessions:**
    *   One Gen Z individual detailed being fired from two accounting roles within the same year. The first was due to being on her phone constantly because the job was "boring" and the company had a "snitch" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The second firing, from an accounting role at a different company, was due to perceived inconsistent attendance and not interacting with colleagues, despite believing she was within her contract terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. She later admitted to having to learn responsibility at a later age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
    *   Another TikTok video showed an employee being terminated for consistent tardiness and a "no call, no show" on her birthday, demonstrating a lack of responsibility and entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
    *   A third example featured an employee who was fired after 15 months of "quiet quitting," where he admittedly did no work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This suggests that the days of "skating by" are over in the modern job market, with employers having less tolerance for such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

## Nuance and Broader Context

While the data presents a critical view, it's acknowledged that it's "easy to beat up on Gen Z" but that it's often "a few bad apples that spoil it for the rest of the generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. Many Gen Z employees are highly motivated, driven, bright, methodical, and strategy-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

It is also noted that every generation has received similar feedback upon entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Gen Z is entering the workforce during one of the most challenging job markets ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Many recent graduates face [[challenges_in_the_job_market_for_new_graduates | challenges in the job market for new graduates]] by applying to thousands of positions to start their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Gen Z is also credited with driving positive change in the workplace, particularly regarding work-life balance, and are seen as potentially improving the "unhealthy and out of balance" nature of modern workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

## Employer Expectations

*   Good interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Internship experience: This is highly recommended for students to gain relevant work experience early in their degree programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Appropriate social media use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   Avoidance of political topics at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

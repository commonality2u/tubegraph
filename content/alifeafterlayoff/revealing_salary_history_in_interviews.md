When preparing for a job interview, it's crucial to understand what information is best kept private. One common mistake job seekers make is revealing their previous salary to potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Why Not to Disclose Previous Salary

Disclosing your previous salary can inadvertently lock you into a lower offer than you might otherwise receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is particularly problematic if you were underpaid in your last role compared to the current market value for your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Instead of letting an employer determine your worth based on past earnings, you, as the candidate, should define your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This value should be based on:
*   Your specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
*   Your experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>
*   Your knowledge and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>
*   What the open market suggests for roles requiring your qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>

While it might seem advantageous to reveal a high past salary if you were well-compensated, in most scenarios, it can limit your negotiation power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

If you're wondering if you're on shaky ground at work, there are several [[indicators_of_being_pushed_out_at_work | signs that you might be getting fired]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. With 20 years of experience in human resources and recruiting for major corporations, the speaker has observed many instances of [[getting_fired_and_its_implications | terminations]] and shares insights into potential warning signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Recognizing these [[quiet_firing_signs | signs]] can prompt you to consider a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

## Leading Indicators of Potential Termination

### Your Metrics Are Down

One of the first indicators that your job might be on the rocks is if your performance metrics are significantly lower, especially compared to your co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Many major corporations publish department-wide metrics, such as sales quotas or other measurable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. If your productivity consistently lags behind your peer group, your name is likely on a list somewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This signals that you should either intensely focus on improving your performance or reevaluate if the role is the right fit for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Continually lower output will draw scrutiny from your boss and their superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Your Boss is Suddenly Displeased with Your Work

A significant [[signs_of_being_undervalued_by_your_employer | red flag]] is when your boss suddenly expresses displeasure with the quality of your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. In this situation, it's advisable to proactively meet with your boss to understand expectations better and request support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Failure to address this can result in you getting a "target on your back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Your Work is Being Redistributed

If you notice that clients you used to support or projects you were involved with are being taken away from you, it's a clear [[quiet_firing_signs | sign]] that you are not meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This redistribution indicates that your employer has lost confidence in your ability to perform the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Exclusion from Key Discussions or Meetings

Another indicator is if you are no longer invited to key discussions or meetings that you previously attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. If your boss starts attending meetings in your place, it often means they are either doing damage control or actively distancing you from specific projects and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### "Weirdness" from Cross-Functional Groups

If leaders of other cross-functional groups with whom you collaborate start acting strangely towards you, or become reluctant to provide you with information, it's a cue to get your radar going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This "weirdness" often suggests that things are not going as well as you might hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Direct Signs of Impending Termination

### Performance Appraisals Drastically Slip

A major [[signs_of_being_undervalued_by_your_employer | red flag]] is when your performance appraisals suddenly decline significantly, especially if you had a history of positive evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. If you are caught off guard by a highly critical appraisal, be aware that your manager is likely documenting your dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

From an HR perspective, when a manager wants to terminate an employee for performance issues, HR will review the employee's file and past performance appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. A sudden drop in performance without prior documentation can appear to be a rash decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. To limit liability, HR typically requires managers to create a "paper trail" by having documented coaching sessions and reflecting performance declines in appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This documentation process is a prelude to an adverse employment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Being Placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

As a last resort for performance-related issues, HR departments often place employees on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. A PIP is a defined period with measurable goals that an employee must meet to retain their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

*   **Failure to Meet Goals**: If you do not meet the very specific and measurable metrics outlined in the PIP, termination is the typical outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Successful Improvement**: If you take the PIP seriously and successfully improve your performance, you can come off the plan and continue in your role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. It then becomes your responsibility to maintain that elevated performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

Being placed on a PIP is a major [[signs_you_should_quit_your_job_immediately | red flag]] and should be taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

## What to Do

If you observe any of these [[signs_to_quit_your_job | signs]], it's crucial to start considering your next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Whether you choose to address the performance issues directly or seek a new opportunity, it will require concerted effort and action on your part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. The primary step is to take action, either to salvage the current situation or to cut bait and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

The question "Why should we hire you?" is often considered one of the most feared questions by job seekers during an interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A recent LinkedIn poll conducted by a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience revealed that the majority of job seekers found this question particularly daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. To effectively answer this question, it is crucial to understand the underlying reasons why employers ask it and what they are truly looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## The Employer's Perspective: Solving a Business Problem

When a hiring manager creates a new position, it is typically in response to a specific business gap or problem that needs to be solved within a department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This could involve replacing an employee who is leaving or moving to a different role, or it could be a new business need requiring additional headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The hiring manager develops a business case to justify the new role, which then leads to a job requisition being posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

Recruiters work closely with hiring managers, conducting an "intake call" to review job specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. During this call, they determine:
*   Why the position is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   The critical tasks required for the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   The skills needed for a candidate to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

This process allows the recruiter to create an "ideal candidate profile" and clearly define the business problem the new hire is expected to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Understanding this specific business problem is paramount for job seekers to answer the "Why should we hire you?" question effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## The Three-Part Formula for Answering "Why Should We Hire You?"

While a recruiter might conduct the initial screen, the "Why should we hire you?" question is most likely to come from the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. There is a strategic, three-part formula to provide a compelling answer:

### 1. Understand the Business Problem
The first step is to identify why the position is open and what specific business problem the company is trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. For example, a company might need to hire due to a new project, a new skill set requirement, or a new division launch, indicating a lack of bandwidth or specific capabilities within the existing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

To uncover this information, job seekers should:
*   **Thoroughly analyze the job description:** Pay close attention to the major points and requirements, as these provide key indicators of the business's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Listen carefully during the recruiter screen:** Recruiters often provide valuable insights and "keys" about the role and the company's needs during preliminary interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This information is critical for subsequent interviews with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### 2. Link Past Experiences to the Business Problem
Once the business problem is identified, the next step is to connect your past experiences and accomplishments directly to that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. If the position involves a specific project or program, highlight how you have worked on similar initiatives in previous roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Frame your answer by explaining how you have already solved similar problems in other organizations, demonstrating a proven track record of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

### 3. Show How You Can Solve Their Specific Problem
The final part of the answer involves explicitly stating how you would apply your skills and experiences to solve the hiring company's current business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Provide a brief, actionable outline of your approach, such as "I've worked on this type of project before; here's how I would solve it: I would do X, Y, and Z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This helps the interviewer visualize you in the role and see how your contributions would directly benefit their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Generic Responses
A common [[job_application_pitfalls_and_tips | pitfall]] job seekers make is providing generic, "fluffy" responses to this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Phrases like "I'm a team player," "I give 110%," "I'm a fast learner," or "I achieve results" are vague and do not differentiate a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Everyone can make such claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

Instead of focusing on broad qualities, emphasize specific business results you have achieved in the past and directly link them to the employer's current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. This targeted approach is the most effective way to demonstrate why you are the ideal candidate for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

By understanding the business problem, linking past successes, and outlining future solutions, job seekers can confidently answer "Why should we hire you?" and significantly improve their [[strategies_to_improve_job_application_success | job application success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

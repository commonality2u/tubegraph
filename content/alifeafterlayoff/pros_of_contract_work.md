If you're currently in a job search and struggling to find success, you might be considering [[contract_work_vs_fulltime_employment|contracting]] as an alternative to full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there can be a stigma associated with contract positions, making them feel like lower quality or temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience offers insights into how recruiters and career coaches view these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For many, [[contract_work_vs_fulltime_employment|contracting]] can be a highly strategic and beneficial path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Increased Availability

Contract positions are often more readily available, especially in uncertain economic climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Companies may still need work done but are hesitant to add permanent headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This means there's a higher likelihood of being considered for a contract role due to their prevalence in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Opportunity to Demonstrate Skills & Reduce Employer Risk

Contract positions provide a valuable chance to demonstrate your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. If an employer is apprehensive or views you as a "stretch" candidate, a contract role offers less risk for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This allows you to prove your capabilities within the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Hiring managers are often risk-averse, particularly concerning permanent hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Offering a contract can be a strategy to allow candidates to prove themselves, with the potential for conversion to a full-time role if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. It's advisable to ask during interviews about the likelihood of conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Career Pivoting and Skill Development

Contract work can be a strategic tool for [[using_contract_work_for_career_transitions|pivoting into a new industry]] or job type, or for gaining a new skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. If local job markets require specific software skills or industry experience you lack, a contract position can help you get your foot in the door and build relevant experience for your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This is a highly strategic way to fill gaps in your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Continued Income During Job Search

Accepting a contract position allows you to continue earning income while you search for a full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Considering that a typical job search can take six to nine months, or even up to a year in some markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, a contract can effectively "buy you more time" to find the perfect full-time opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Test Driving the Company

Just as companies can "test drive" you through a contract, you can also "test drive" the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If you find the work environment, the specific tasks, co-workers, or your boss unbearable, a contract allows you to cut ties easily, much like the company can with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This provides an opportunity to "dip your toe in the water" before committing to a long-term position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Confidence Boost After Layoff

For those who have experienced a layoff, which can significantly impact mentality and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, a contract position can help rebuild self-assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It gets you back into the workforce and establishes a routine, and it's generally easier to find a job when you already have a steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Potentially Higher Hourly Pay

In many cases, contract positions can offer a higher hourly rate compared to a full-time role, potentially leading to significantly more income when extrapolated over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Some individuals earn enough from contract work to take extended breaks each year while still remaining financially secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. While this often comes with a lack of benefits and job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, it can be a viable lifestyle for those who manage it correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Ultimately, the decision to pursue [[contract_work_vs_fulltime_employment|contracting]] depends on your personal preferences, the current job market, and how frequently you're receiving job inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. For those in a difficult job search, a contract position can be a significant help in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

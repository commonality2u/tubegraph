While [[salary_transparency_through_selfreporting | salary transparency]] is broadly considered beneficial for creating a level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:58">[03:06:58]</a>, it is crucial to approach discussions about pay with caution, especially within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:09">[03:17:09]</a>.

## Why You Should Avoid Disclosing Salary to Coworkers

Disclosing your salary to coworkers within your organization can lead to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
If salaries are shared, it's common for someone in the group to discover they are underpaid, leading to upset feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:47">[03:20:47]</a>. This realization can cause an employee to quit or confront management, demanding fairer compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:48">[03:29:48]</a>.

> "The boss says I can't trust this person anymore, I can't trust that person anymore and even if there's a legitimate reason why you're paid more maybe you have more skill or more experience in a certain thing or if the job market has changed and this person has stayed in their job too long that boss will now look at you as somebody they can't trust and guess what if they can't trust you you're never going to get promoted." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:55">[03:39:55]</a>

Even if there are valid reasons for salary differences, such as greater skill, experience, or changes in the job market, the act of disclosure can erode trust with management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:59">[03:44:59]</a>. A loss of trust can prevent future promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>.

## Recommended Approach for [[Salary Transparency Through Selfreporting | Salary Transparency]]

Instead of discussing salary directly with coworkers, it is advisable to share your pay information anonymously on external platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:05">[04:01:05]</a>. Recommended sites include:
*   Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:18">[04:02:18]</a>
*   Comparably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:07">[04:03:07]</a>
*   Team Blind (especially for those in the tech industry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:47">[04:04:47]</a>

Sharing salary information anonymously on these platforms helps others understand what constitutes fair compensation for a particular role, without incurring potential negative consequences in your own workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

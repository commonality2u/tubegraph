Bosses are firing [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] workers at a record rate, due to a variety of factors related to [[employer_selection_criteria_and_expectations | employer expectations]] and the actual skills and attitudes demonstrated by these new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Survey Findings on Gen Z in the Workplace

A survey conducted by Intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders involved in hiring, revealed interesting insights into their attitudes towards [[challenges_faced_by_recent_college_graduates_in_the_workplace | recent college graduates]] (the [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] workforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   75% of companies reported having hired some [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Surprisingly, 6 out of 10 companies admitted to having fired a [[challenges_faced_by_recent_college_graduates_in_the_workplace | recent college graduate]] within the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Reasons for [[reasons_for_firing_gen_z_employees | Firing Gen Z Employees]]

The survey detailed several reasons why these new hires did not work out. Employers reported at least some issue with 75% of [[challenges_faced_by_recent_college_graduates_in_the_workplace | recent college grad]] hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The most frequently cited problems include:

*   Lack of [[relevance_of_skills_in_a_changing_job_market | relevant work experience]] (a point of disconnect, as entry-level positions often demand experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Poor problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

*   Difficulty working in a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

### Employer Beliefs About Gen Z

Hiring managers also hold specific beliefs about [[challenges_faced_by_gen_z_in_the_job_market | recent college graduates]]:
*   **Entitlement**: 65-70% believe they are entitled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This includes wanting quick promotions without demonstrated experience or high salaries without "paying their dues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Easily Offended**: 65% believe they get offended easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of Work Ethic**: This is a frequently cited concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Unpreparedness**: They are seen as unprepared for the workforce (about 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Workload Management**: One in five report that [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] often cannot manage the workload and are unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Punctuality & Professionalism**: Approximately 20% are often late to start and do not dress professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. 19% do not use appropriate language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, and often late to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Manageability**: 17% find them too difficult to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> and they often hand in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Technical Skills**: Surprisingly, 28% cited a lack of technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Disconnect: Education vs. Workplace Reality

Companies are hiring [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] and entry-level workers, but are quick to act on perceived [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_current_workplace_norms | cultural mismatches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Despite spending significant money on college degrees, many graduates are deemed unprepared for the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. There is a significant [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_current_workplace_norms | cultural disconnect]] and a lack of sufficient transition training from academia to the professional world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

A troubling trend is that one in seven companies may not hire any [[challenges_faced_by_recent_college_graduates_in_the_workplace | college graduates]] in 2025, and one out of six hiring managers is hesitant to hire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Employers suggest that a stronger work ethic and a better attitude would make [[challenges_faced_by_recent_college_graduates_in_the_workplace | college graduates]] more hirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Employer Demands and Expectations

Employers are demanding specific qualities from new hires:
*   **Initiative and Positive Attitude**: Showing initiative and having positive attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Strong Work Ethic**: Demonstrating a strong work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Openness to Feedback**: Being adaptable and open to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Punctuality and Reliability**: Being punctual and reliable, not constantly late or unorganized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Solid Technical and Interpersonal Skills**: Possessing good technical skills and strong interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Internship Experience**: Recruiters specifically look for internship experience, recommending students seek as many as possible early in their degree programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Social Media Conduct**: Maintaining work-appropriate social media presence, as employers do check social media profiles to assess [[cultural_mismatch_between_gen_z_and_current_workplace_norms | culture fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Avoiding sharing every aspect of life, especially in a professional setting, and refraining from posting about slacking off at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Political Topics**: Steering clear of political discussions in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Anecdotal Evidence and Case Studies

The transcript includes several anecdotes illustrating employer concerns:
*   **Construction Company Owner**: Described young people (under 30) as entitled, uneducated, lacking communication skills, critical thinking, and motivation, requiring constant supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. They also noted zero attention to detail, frustration with persistence, and inability to separate from phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, attributing short attention spans to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Emergency Department Nurse Grad**: A new nurse graduate was constantly on her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and texted friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. After her phone was locked away, she had a tantrum and chose her phone over her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This led the department to stop hiring new nurse grads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Government IT Professional**: Computer science grads hired for entry-level IT admin positions did not last more than 6 months, exhibiting issues like lack of focus, attention, communication skills, urgency, and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **TikTok Case Study (Accounting Diplomas)**: A [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] individual detailed being fired from two accounting roles due to being on her phone too much, perceiving company culture as "snitchy" and "cliquey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. In a second role, she was fired for perceived irregular hours, despite her contract allowing flexible start times, and disliked interacting with a co-worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. While she eventually found footing, this highlights a disconnect in understanding workplace expectations and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **TikTok Case Study (Absenteeism and Tardiness)**: An audio clip features an HR representative terminating an employee (Tatiana) for consistent tardiness (12 to 32 minutes late) and a "no call, no show" on her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The employee shows a lack of responsibility and entitlement, not seeing an issue with being late or absent without notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **TikTok Case Study (Quiet Quitting)**: A male [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] states, "Everybody keeps asking me why I got fired from my job. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything for 15 months and they found out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This exemplifies "quiet quitting" or "quitting in place," where an employee does minimal or no work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## Conclusion

While it's easy to generalize, it's important to remember that these are often "a few bad apples" spoiling the perception for the rest of the generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Many [[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] employees are highly motivated, driven, and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

[[Generation Zs perspective on career and workplace | Gen Z]] is entering the workforce during one of the most difficult job markets ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, often having to apply to thousands of positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. They are also driving positive change, particularly in advocating for work-life balance, which is a welcome shift in an often unhealthy workplace culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

Documenting job interview experiences on social media can offer both entertainment and insights into the hiring process. One notable example features a Twitter user known as "fur" who chronicled his unexpected re-interview with a company that had recently terminated him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## "Fur's" Unconventional Interview
The story, shared in a play-by-play format on Twitter, began when "fur," unemployed after being fired, was contacted by a recruiter for an interview for the same position with the same employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The recruiter and company were seemingly unaware they were inviting back a recently terminated employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

### Preparation and Disguise
Deciding to "have a little bit of fun" with the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, "fur" documented his preparations:
*   He considered wearing a top hat and a mustache, or his old uniform, ultimately opting for the uniform and purchasing a fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   He noted the front desk seemed "unfazed" by his appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   He was asked to put on a face mask, which he did over his fake mustache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

### The Interview Process
The interview unfolded with several bizarre elements:
*   **Company Oversight** "Fur's" phone was still able to connect to the company's Wi-Fi network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring Manager's Lack of Awareness** The hiring manager was someone "fur" had not met before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. "Fur" used a resume that didn't list his old jobs by name, instead being a copy-paste of the job listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. The manager expressed that "fur" seemed like an "ideal candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>, but admitted not being "technical enough to ask you some of the hard questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Location and Snacks** "Fur" was interviewed in a different building than where he previously worked, limiting his chances of being seen by old co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The company was notably generous with snacks, offering water, gummy bears, pretzels, and beef jerky throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
*   **Recognition** During the interview, an engineer joined the meeting. "Fur" recognized this engineer from the break room and noted the engineer seemed to recognize him, asking if he had "freelance[d] here before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. "Fur" responded truthfully, "I freelanced in a lot of places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

### The Reveal
The interview quickly became "police interrogation levels of awkward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a> when the hiring manager finally realized "fur" had been fired from the company just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. The manager expressed fury that "fur" hadn't disclosed this, despite the company initiating the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. This realization came after two full interviews and several hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. "Fur" offered the manager a gummy bear, which was "politely declined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. It is assumed "fur" was then asked to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

This anecdote highlights potential breakdowns in a company's hiring process and internal communication, especially regarding terminations and candidate vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. It also showcases how [[Social medias impact on career | social media]] can be used to share unique and entertaining, albeit potentially embarrassing, career experiences.

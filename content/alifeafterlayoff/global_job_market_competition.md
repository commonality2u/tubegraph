The traditional career model, where individuals select a career at 18 and remain with one employer for 40 years to collect a pension, is considered "completely dead" in the modern workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This shift is largely due to increased competition in a globalized job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Shift from Localized Hiring
Historically, hiring was a very localized process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>. Companies were based in specific geographic regions, and people living in those areas would often work for the one or two major employers nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Nepotism was common, with connections like a father working at a factory helping someone get a foot in the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

In the past, employers generally treated employees with a degree of loyalty, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Layoffs were not constant, and if an employee wasn't excelling in one role, they might be moved to a different department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Global Competition
Today's job market is drastically different due to global connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. The rise of job boards and platforms like LinkedIn allows individuals to apply for thousands of jobs across the globe from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This has led to significantly increased competition, making it much more difficult to secure a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Job seekers are now competing with thousands of other people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Employer Mentality and Layoff Cycles
Companies now operate with a "what have you done for me lately" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This short-term perspective contributes to a cycle of layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This cycle, which follows economic patterns, seems to be shortening, meaning companies are increasingly laying off employees more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Unlike past generations, current employees are much more susceptible to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This is partly because companies no longer face the same constraints in finding new talent; they have a "million candidates at their fingertips" globally, enabling them to lay off people more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## Decoupling of Employer-Employee Loyalty
Another factor contributing to the [[challenges_in_the_job_market | challenges in the job market]] is the shift in retirement plans. Employers moved from defined benefits plans (pensions) in the 70s, 80s, and 90s to defined contribution plans (like 401ks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. This shifted the burden of retirement savings primarily onto the employee, with employers often only providing a small match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

Long vesting periods (often four or more years) for employer matching contributions mean that if an employee is laid off before vesting, the employer reclaims the matched funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. This further reduces employer commitment and loyalty to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. The employer is perceived as less loyal than the employee, as they lay off staff at a moment's notice due to the broader pool of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

## Impact of Disruptive Technologies
The rise of disruptive technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), further impacts the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. AI is considered the most disruptive technology to enter the workforce, with the potential to displace millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This technology allows employers to further detach from employee loyalty, as they may not need human labor in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Reality
As a result of these factors, the traditional career no longer exists, and the way people approach work is drastically changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Future trends in the [[state_of_the_current_job_market | current job market]] include:
*   More common short-term assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
*   Less taboo surrounding job hopping, especially given frequent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.
*   A continued rise in contract positions, as employers aim to avoid expensive full-time employees with benefits and 401ks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

Employees must re-evaluate how they fund their retirement, as they can no longer rely on employers, particularly with frequent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This necessitates a more strategic approach to careers, with individuals acting as "free agents" and the "CEO of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

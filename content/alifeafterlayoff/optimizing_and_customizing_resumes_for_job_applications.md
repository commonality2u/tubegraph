When seeking re-employment, it's crucial to expedite the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Being unemployed or in a toxic work environment is highly stressful, and a job search adds to that burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. To speed up the process, a key step is to [[strategic_resume_writing_and_optimization_for_job_seekers | optimize your resume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Necessity of Resume Optimization

A generic resume is insufficient in today's labor market; you must take steps to truly [[strategies_for_standing_out_in_job_applications | stand out from the competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### ATS Compliance
One aspect of optimization involves Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Resumes must be [[improving_resume_format_for_applicant_tracking_systems | compliant with ATS systems]] to ensure they are seen correctly and can be discovered later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While ATS typically doesn't screen out resumes as much as a human, ensuring correct parsing by the system is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### [[importance_of_customization_in_resumes | Customization Beyond ATS]]
Even more important than ATS compliance is having a [[importance_of_customizing_resumes | custom resume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. In situations with a large pool of candidates, a customized resume helps pull your application to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. For example, a senior position might receive 700 applications in 24 hours, making it impossible to review all manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Recruiters search their ATS for specific criteria, and an [[challenges_and_tips_for_resume_optimization | optimized resume]] is more likely to be pulled up in these targeted searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Therefore, making a habit of [[updating_resumes_and_job_searching_strategies | customizing and optimizing your resume]] is essential to accelerate your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Leveraging Multiple Resumes

If you possess different specialties or are qualified for more than one type of role, consider creating [[resources_for_creating_effective_resumes | multiple resumes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Sending a "jack of all trades" resume tends to dilute your results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Instead, focus on being a great fit for a particular role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. By sending a more targeted resume, you increase the likelihood of capturing a hiring manager's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Avoid sending the same generic resume to various jobs, as this typically yields poor results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Efficiency Tips for Job Applications

### Focused Application Strategy
Instead of panic applying to any job that's remotely interesting or for which you think you're remotely qualified, narrow down your applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This "panic applying" dilutes your results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Time spent on such applications would be better invested in building your network on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

A blunt reality of the market is that you're unlikely to be called for a job unless you closely match at least 70% of the job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Applying to jobs where you lack relevant experience, hoping an employer will infer transferable skills, is a long shot and a poor use of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This approach can slow down your job search, lead to burnout, and primarily generate rejections, which can negatively affect mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Focus your efforts on jobs for which you are genuinely well-qualified, as these are the roles for which you're most likely to be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Communication Templates
While resume templates are generally not recommended as they can hinder job search efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, creating templates for communicating with hiring managers and recruiters can be highly efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. You can set up custom signatures in email services like Gmail to auto-populate confirmations and other common communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This saves time from repeatedly typing the same information during extensive applications and networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Alternatively, use a separate Google Doc to store common phrases or paragraphs to cut and paste as needed, ensuring to add a touch of [[job_application_tips_and_strategies | customization]] to avoid sounding robotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

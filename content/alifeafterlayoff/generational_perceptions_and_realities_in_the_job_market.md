Bosses are reportedly firing Gen Z workers in record time, with companies citing various reasons for these terminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trend highlights significant [[job_market_challenges_for_gen_z_in_2024 | job market challenges for Gen Z in 2024]] and a perceived disconnect between employer expectations and the preparedness of recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Employer Hesitancy and Firings

A survey conducted by intelligent.com in August, involving 966 business leaders involved in hiring, revealed that one in six companies are hesitant to hire recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
Key findings from the survey include:
*   75% of companies reported hiring Gen Z employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   6 out of 10 companies admitted to firing a recent college graduate in the same year they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   75% of companies reported at least some issue with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   This suggests employers are quick to fire if they perceive a cultural mismatch, especially as generations shift in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Perceived Issues with Gen Z Hires

Employers cited several frequently observed issues with recent college graduate hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>:
*   **Lack of Motivation/Initiative** (50% of employers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   **Lack of Professionalism** (nearly 46%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **Lack of Organizational Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   **Lack of Communication Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   **Challenges with Feedback** (not taking feedback well) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   **Lack of Relevant Work Experience**: This is noted as interesting, as entry-level positions often require 2-3 years of experience, creating a disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Poor Problem-Solving Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **Insufficient Technical Skills** (28% surprisingly cited this) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   **Bad Culture Fit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **Difficulty Working in a Team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

## Employer Beliefs about Gen Z

Hiring managers hold specific beliefs about recent college graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>:
*   **Entitled** (65-70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   **Easily Offended** (65%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   **Lack of Work Ethic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   **Doesn't Respond Well to Feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   **Unprepared for the Workforce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   **Poor Communication Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   **Lack of Motivation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   **Costs More to Train** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

Specific behaviors employers observe include:
*   Inability to manage workload and unprofessionalism (1 in 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Often late to start work (about 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Often don't dress professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Often don't use appropriate language at work (19%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Often late to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Often too difficult to manage (17%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Often hand in assignments late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Some employers are considering not hiring any college graduates in 2025 due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. A stronger work ethic and better attitude are seen as qualities that would make college graduates more hirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Anecdotal Evidence and Case Studies

Comments from business owners and professionals corroborate survey findings:
*   A construction company owner in Southern California noted that young people under 30 (with few exceptions) lack communication, critical thinking, motivation, and require constant supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. They also struggle with persistence and are constantly on their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   An emergency department worker recounted a new nurse graduate who wouldn't stay off her phone, ignored assignments and patients, and even texted friends about patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This individual chose her phone over her job, leading the department to stop hiring new nurse grads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   A government IT professional shared that all entry-level computer science graduates hired for IT admin positions lasted less than 6 months due to similar issues: no focus, attention, communication skills, urgency, or professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Several TikTok videos illustrate these points:
*   One Gen Z individual described being fired from two accounting roles for being on her phone too much, claiming the first role was "boring" and the company culture had "snitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. She also mentioned not liking micromanagement and eventually leaving another job because she "hates accounting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   Another video captured a Gen Z employee being terminated for consistent absenteeism and tardiness, including being 12 minutes, 21 minutes, and 32 minutes late on different days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. She also had a "no call no show" on her birthday, stating she didn't think she needed to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   A third example showed an employee stating they were fired for "not doing anything for 15 months," indicating a "quiet quitting" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Challenges for Gen Z in the Job Market

Gen Z is entering the workforce during one of the most "Topsy Turvy" and difficult [[current_job_market_challenges | job markets]] ever experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Many college graduates find themselves applying to thousands of positions just to get a start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This [[challenges_of_the_current_job_market | current job market]] is characterized by too few jobs and too many people seeking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Furthermore, it appears universities are not adequately preparing students for success in the [[strategies_to_navigate_the_modern_job_market | modern workplace]], leading to a significant cultural disconnect and insufficient transition training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Recommendations for Gen Z to Navigate the Modern Workplace

To succeed in the [[strategies_to_navigate_the_modern_job_market | modern workplace]], employers are looking for individuals who demonstrate:
*   Initiative and positive attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Strong work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   Adaptability and openness to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Punctuality and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Solid technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Internship experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Appropriate social media presence, as employers often check candidates' social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   Avoiding political topics in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## A Nuanced Perspective

It's important to recognize that it's "easy to beat up on Gen Z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, but this perception often stems from a "few bad apples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. Many Gen Z employees are highly motivated, driven, methodical, and strategy-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Historically, every generation has faced similar feedback upon entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Gen Z should be given grace, as they are entering a particularly difficult [[challenges_of_the_current_job_market | job market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. They are also contributing to positive change, such as driving improvements in work-life balance within the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

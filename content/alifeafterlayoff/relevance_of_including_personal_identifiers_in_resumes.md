When crafting a resume, it is crucial to avoid including certain personal identifiers, especially within the United States. This practice helps to prevent unconscious bias and potential discrimination from recruiters and hiring managers, ensuring that assessments are made based solely on work-related qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[04:34]</a>.

## Photographs

In the U.S. or North America, including a photograph on a resume is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>. A recruiter seeing a photo might automatically assume the applicant is not based in the U.S., which can be a particular consideration for those seeking work in the United States from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>. The primary goal is to avoid being judged on non-work-related aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01">[04:01]</a>. However, in regions where photographs are customary on resumes, applicants should follow local tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.

## Demographic Information

Any personal identifiers that relate to protected classes should be omitted from a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53">[04:53]</a>. This includes:
*   Gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>
*   Race or Creed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[04:26]</a>
*   Color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>
*   Marital status, such as being married with children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>

Including such details gives employers reasons to potentially discriminate against an applicant based on factors unrelated to their qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40">[04:40]</a>, despite laws against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>. This advice is primarily U.S.-specific; in other countries, different customs may apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.

## Email Addresses

An unprofessional email address can create a negative first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14">[05:14]</a>. It is advisable to use a clean, neutral email address, such as one with your full name, avoiding nicknames or anything that could lead to judgment or discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33">[05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a>.

## Full Addresses

Full street addresses are no longer necessary on a resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53">[05:53]</a>. Recruiters only need to know the city and state of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57">[05:57]</a>. Providing a specific address can lead to assumptions or discrimination based on perceived commute distance or geographic location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05">[06:05]</a>. While companies should not make assumptions about candidates, omitting specific location details can prevent premature screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31">[06:31]</a>.

### Remote Work Considerations
Even for remote positions, including city and state is important for recruiters to understand potential time zone differences or taxation issues, as companies must be set up to conduct business in specific regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53">[06:53]</a>. This is particularly true for international applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21">[07:21]</a>.

## Other Irrelevant Personal Information

*   **Salary History:** Do not include previous or expected compensation on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37">[10:37]</a>. Disclosing this information could lead to a lowball offer if an employer sees an opportunity to hire you for less than their budget allows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51">[10:51]</a>.
*   **References:** It is unnecessary to list actual references or state "references available upon request" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56">[09:56]</a>. Recruiters will request references if needed, and most employers are moving away from routinely checking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15">[10:15]</a>. This also relates to the [[impact_of_references_on_the_hiring_process | impact of references on the hiring process]].
*   **Minor Education Details:** Avoid excessive detail about degrees, such as specific college departments (e.g., "Schmiel" instead of "Penn State") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>. Similarly, while minor degrees can act as [[relevance_of_work_history_and_education_in_resumes | keywords]], employers generally do not weigh them heavily, so avoid wasting resume space detailing courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01">[09:01]</a>.
*   **GPA (for experienced candidates):** If you are more than three years out of college, your GPA is typically not relevant and can be removed from your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22">[09:22]</a>.
*   **Internships (for experienced candidates):** Similarly, internships can be removed from a resume if you have been in the workforce for more than three years, as they are not counted as total years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45">[09:45]</a>.

By omitting these personal identifiers, candidates can present a cleaner, more focused resume that highlights their professional qualifications and minimizes the chance of negative judgment or discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43">[00:43]</a>, reinforcing the [[importance_of_a_strong_resume | importance of a strong resume]]. The overall aim is to make the resume as clear as possible to enhance the chance of being hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">[08:38]</a>.

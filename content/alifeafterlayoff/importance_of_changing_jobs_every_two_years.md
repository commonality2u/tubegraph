It is recommended to look for a new job at least once every two years, even if you are currently satisfied in your role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This strategy encourages individuals to proactively manage their careers and avoid complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Why Change Jobs Every Two Years?

Staying too long in one position can lead to the market passing you by, affecting both [[strategies_for_career_advancement_beyond_job_hopping | career progression]] and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. To act like the CEO of your career or a "free agent," it's crucial to continuously monitor the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### The Problem of Wage Stagnation

Companies often bring in new talent at significantly higher salaries (10-20% raises) than those offered to internal employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Internal promotions might only offer a 5-10% bump every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Meanwhile, annual cost of living adjustments (1-3%) often don't keep pace with inflation, meaning long-term employees might effectively earn less money for the same work over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Recruiters frequently observe departments where salaries are 20-30% below market rate, especially when employees are not actively testing the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. If you have been in the same role for more than two to three years without significant promotions or raises, the market has likely passed you by, making it difficult to catch up unless a major company-wide salary adjustment occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Case Study: The Power of Market Testing

Consider an individual who spent seven to eight years with the same employer in the medical field, a high-demand market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Despite being a top performer and having received promotions, their department experienced nearly 100% turnover in 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Motivated by this and through networking, they explored new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

After a full interview process, they received an offer for an additional $5 per hour, though it came with a longer commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Upon informing their current employer of their intent to leave, they received an astonishing counteroffer: a $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

This situation highlights a common employer behavior: waiting until an employee is tendering their resignation to offer proper compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It raises questions about whether the employee was significantly underpaid or if the company was simply trying to retain top talent in a tight labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. While companies that are "pay leaders" aim to retain talent by paying competitively, "pay laggers" might accept high turnover until it significantly impacts [[long_term_job_stability_and_career_management | intellectual knowledge]] and skill retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The cost of recruiting and training new staff can outweigh the cost of retaining existing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The individual ultimately accepted the counteroffer, citing comfort with the familiar processes, vested benefits (vacation, 401ks), and a known work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This decision acknowledges that while new opportunities can offer higher [[salary_growth_through_job_transitions_versus_staying_in_the_same_role | salary growth]], the "grass is not always greener" and the onboarding process at a new company can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Some individuals who left during the "Great Resignation" have even returned to previous employers, a trend known as "boomeranging," after finding new roles less fulfilling or more dysfunctional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Strategy: Regularly Testing the Open Market

Even if you are satisfied with your current employer, you should, at a minimum, test the open market every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This involves:
*   Submitting applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Networking with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Engaging in interview processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The purpose is to:
*   Stay informed about market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Identify what [[importance_of_career_strategy_and_skill_updating | skills]] are in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Assess how you are being evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   Determine if you are underpaid relative to the market by reaching the offer stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

While obtaining an offer can be a tool for salary discussions, it's advised to use this tactic carefully, as constantly leveraging outside offers can lead your current company to call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, understanding where the market is trending is crucial for managing your [[importance_of_career_strategy_and_skill_updating | career strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Taking Ownership of Your Career

In today's rapidly changing job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, it is more important than ever to stay on top of market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. If you receive a significant salary increase only when announcing your intent to leave, it indicates you were likely underpaid to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

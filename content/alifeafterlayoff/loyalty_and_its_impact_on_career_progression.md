While everyone is likely to make career mistakes, some lessons are typically learned the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A common mistake observed by career coaches is the belief that [[the_impact_of_company_loyalty_on_career_advancement | company loyalty]] will naturally lead to career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## The Myth of Loyalty Paying Off

A significant lesson often learned later in one's [[strategies_for_effective_career_progression | career progression]] is that loyalty rarely pays off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. An individual's personal experience highlights this, where staying with an organization for too long, expecting a senior role to open up, resulted in stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This [[impact_of_excessive_company_loyalty | excessive company loyalty]] led to falling behind peers in terms of responsibility, level, and compensation in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

> "The biggest lesson you often learn is something that you won't know until it's much later in your career and often times it might be too late it's that you're going to make a critical mistake somewhere early in your career and you're not going to realize it until years later." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>

## Consequences of Excessive Loyalty

[[impact_of_excessive_company_loyalty | Overstaying your welcome]] in a job is identified as a critical mistake that may not be realized until years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This can include:
*   Staying too long in a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   Not pursuing new opportunities due to comfort or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   Accepting a job that isn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Focusing too long on a career vertical that no longer resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

Another hard lesson is that hard work alone does not guarantee [[career_advancement_and_internal_promotion | promotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Working excessive hours to impress a boss, even a workaholic one, may not lead to the desired [[career_advancement_and_internal_promotion | promotion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Instead, it's about working smartest by focusing on highly visible projects that matter to senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## Short-Lived Goodwill

A particularly painful lesson, especially relevant given recent layoffs, is that an employee is only as good as their most recent contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Goodwill built up from past major projects is often very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. If an employer no longer sees future contributions or relevance in an employee's skills, despite past loyalty and hard work, that individual may face unfavorable outcomes like layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This contributes to the feeling of the [[the_breakdown_of_corporate_loyalty | breakdown of corporate loyalty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

> "As cold and as Cutthroat as it may seem senior leaders only care about what you can produce tomorrow not necessarily what you're producing today." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>

## Prioritizing Your Career

To navigate these challenges and ensure [[strategies_for_effective_career_progression | effective career progression]], individuals must:
*   **Be their own advocate**: Nobody else in the organization will advocate for an individual's [[career_advancement_and_internal_promotion | promotion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   **Gain visibility**: It's crucial to find ways to get in front of your boss's boss, as they are often the decision-makers for promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Market yourself**: As the "CEO of your career," you must manage your "marketing department" to promote your effectiveness within the company and in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on relevant skills**: While being good at one thing can be an advantage, employers value highly in-demand, relevant skills that are transferable across multiple employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Skills can become irrelevant quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Act as a free agent**: It is not wrong to prioritize your own career first, even before an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. You must always look out for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

Understanding these lessons can help individuals avoid common pitfalls in their careers and gain control over their professional journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

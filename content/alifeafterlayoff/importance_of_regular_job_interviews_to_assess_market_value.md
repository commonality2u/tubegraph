To effectively act as the "CEO of your career," it is crucial to consistently monitor the job market and understand your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Remaining in a single role for an extended period can lead to career stagnation and falling behind market compensation trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Why Staying Too Long Can Be Detrimental
Staying in one job for too long often means the market passes you by, impacting both [[current_job_market_analysis_and_opportunities | career progression]] and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

An illustrative example highlights this: a high-performing individual who spent seven to eight years with the same employer was relatively happy in their role, despite nearly 100% turnover in their broader department over 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This individual, in a high-demand medical field, pursued new opportunities and received an offer paying $5 more per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>. Upon informing their current employer of their intent to leave, they were counter-offered a $15 per hour raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The employer justified this significant raise by stating a desire to retain talent due to high departmental turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

This scenario raises questions about why employers often wait for a resignation to offer fair compensation, suggesting either a reactive retention strategy or an intentional underpayment that was tolerated until a mass exodus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Companies often have "pay leader" or "pay laggard" philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. While "pay leaders" proactively retain talent, "pay laggards" may accept high turnover as part of their model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. However, constantly replacing employees is more expensive due to recruiting costs, training, and the loss of intellectual or "tribal" knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

Despite the general advice against accepting counter-offers, the individual accepted the $15 per hour raise, citing comfort with known processes, vested benefits (vacation, 401k), and established relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Some individuals who leave for new roles may even "boomerang" back to their previous employers if the new role doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Strategy for Staying Competitive

Even when satisfied in your current role, it is essential to regularly engage with the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Recommended Frequency
At a minimum, you should [[understanding_market_value_for_job_roles | test the open market]] every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Submitting applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   Networking with recruiters in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Market Testing
The primary goals of this practice are to:
*   Keep abreast of market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   Experience the [[effective_interview_tactics_for_job_seekers | interview process]] to understand in-demand skills and assessment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   Determine if you are underpaid by reaching the offer stage and discussing salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

Staying in a role for too long often results in the market surpassing your compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. New external hires frequently receive 10-20% raises when changing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. In contrast, internal promotions might only offer a 5-10% bump every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Annual cost-of-living adjustments (1-3%) often fail to keep pace with inflation, effectively decreasing your real earnings over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This can lead to significant wage stagnation, with some departments being 20-30% below market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Offers
While it's not advisable to constantly leverage small offers with your current employer, understanding market trends is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. If you receive a substantial offer, carefully consider whether to use it as leverage, but be prepared for your company to call your bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. A large salary increase offered only when you announce your departure suggests you were underpaid to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

By proactively dabbling in the market every two years and targeting "pay leader" or "Alpha employers," you can gain insight into industry standards and ensure you are being paid appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. This proactive approach helps in [[the_importance_of_valuing_oneself_in_the_job_market | valuing oneself properly]] and avoiding falling too far behind market rates, which can become impossible to recover from without a major company-wide salary adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. The market is constantly shifting, making continuous awareness more important than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

The concept of "quiet quitting" has emerged as an extension of the [[great_resignation | Great Resignation]], representing a significant shift in the [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employer-employee relationship dynamics]] and how individuals approach their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This phenomenon suggests a reevaluation of traditional work expectations and a move towards establishing clearer boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## What is Quiet Quitting?

Quiet quitting is defined as "effectively quitting your job without quitting your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It involves reducing one's output to the minimum acceptable standard required for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This means doing "just enough to get by," not taking on additional tasks or burdens, and focusing on the bare minimum to alleviate work-related stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This concept is a legitimate phenomenon currently happening in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and was highlighted in a Business Insider article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Rise of Coasting Culture

The move towards quiet quitting and "coasting culture" is a deliberate decision by employees, rather than a sign of laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Reasons for the Shift
*   **Work as a Paycheck:** During the pandemic, many employees began viewing work solely as a means to earn a paycheck to support themselves and their families, rather than a "higher calling" demanding their utmost devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This means a shift from "live to work" to "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Feeling Exploited:** Employees feel they are done with companies "squeezing free labor" out of them, after years of feeling exploited through late nights, lost weekends, and demands for loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Ideal Conditions:** The pandemic created conditions conducive to this shift, including a hot labor market ensuring job security and the rise of remote work making it harder for managers to monitor effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Betrayal from Layoffs:** Ruthless cuts made by companies during the 2020 pandemic, despite years of employee hustle and sacrifice, led to a deep sense of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Those who remained were "piled on" with extra work due to understaffing, leading to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Work Pendulum
The [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employment market]] operates like a pendulum, and for a long time, it was heavily skewed towards employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Employers demanded high productivity for minimal pay, viewing employees as "human resources" to be exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This fostered a "hustle culture" where employees felt compelled to work long hours, take on extra tasks, and be constantly available, even on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Companies historically went through cycles of bloating with staff, followed by catastrophic events (like the 2008 subprime crisis or 9/11) that led to layoffs, allowing them to become "leaner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The period before 2020 saw extended growth and bloating, making the pandemic an "opportune time" for companies to make ruthless cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Impact of the 2020 Pandemic and Layoffs
The 2020 pandemic and subsequent layoffs fractured the workforce, leading to a seismic shift in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The pendulum has now swung towards the employee, a shift not seen since the 1930s with the Fair Labor Standards Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Companies that overzealously cut staff now face a backfired situation as demand has returned, and employees are unwilling to return to the previous "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Generational Shift
There is a generational component to this reevaluation: Baby Boomers are exiting the workforce, replaced by Gen Z, whose mentality about the workplace is "completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This forces companies to reevaluate how they treat employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Loyalty to a single company for 20+ years has become antiquated, often leading to employees falling behind on compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Re-evaluating the [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | Employer-Employee Relationship]]

Employees are now re-evaluating whether the "hustle culture" was worth the sacrifices they made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The sentiment "my company's not my family" has taken hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, leading employees to shed expectations of grueling hours they once accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. After decades of "leaning in," many are now "leaning back" to avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Setting [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | Employment Boundaries]]
People are no longer willing to be overloaded with work, work long hours, or work on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. They are finally establishing [[employeremployee_relationship_dynamics | employment boundaries]] in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This is seen as a healthy development, as employers who previously "behaved badly" must now re-evaluate how they treat their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Some employees choose quiet quitting because they have built up equity, vacation time, or 401k investments, making outright quitting less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Employers, unable to easily backfill positions, may accept minimal output as "some output is better than no output at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Speaker's Perspective

While explaining the phenomenon, the speaker does not advocate for quiet quitting, slacking off, or being lazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Instead, the speaker encourages individuals to critically evaluate their work situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

The preferred approach is to:
*   Keep your resume updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   Strategically plan your exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Treat yourself like a "free agent" to upgrade your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Introduction

The landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is witnessing a significant shift, with generalist AI models increasingly outperforming task-specific AI solutions. This trend has profound implications for how AI tools are developed and utilized.

## Historical Dominance of Task-Specific AI

Historically, [[Training and finetuning processes for AI models|machine learning]] models trained on specific tasks were expected to outperform general intelligence models on those particular tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. A machine learning model trained on a variety of different tasks would typically be beaten by models trained specifically for each of those tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

## The Shift Towards General AI Superiority

However, this is "no longer the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. Increasingly, general AI models are demonstrating superior performance compared to their task-specific counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. For example, GPT-4, possessing "generalist knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, was observed to answer questions about a PDF perfectly, even without having explicitly read that specific document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.

## Implications for AI Tools and Development

This paradigm shift raises critical questions for developers and users of AI tools:

*   **Relevance of Task-Specific Tools**: If a general AI like GPT-4 can answer specific questions accurately without needing access to a particular PDF, the purpose of creating a "PDF specific AI tool" becomes questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. The existence of products like pdfgbt.io or chatpdf.com, designed for specific PDF interactions, is challenged when a generalist model can perform the same function "perfectly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.

> "what's the point of creating a PDF specific AI tool where you can give it a PDF and it allows you to answer questions on it if gpt4 itself can just answer those questions for you without ever having to read this PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>

*   **Future of Information Consumption**: The effectiveness of general AI models suggests a future where "reading books" or "reading papers" could be replaced by simply asking a powerful GPT model about their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. This could fundamentally change how information is consumed and disseminated in academic and professional fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.
*   **Adaptation of Formats**: If humans are no longer the primary readers of papers, but rather AI models, the format of academic papers might evolve to be "more consumable by gpts and llms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>.
*   **API Design**: In software development, there's an emerging question of whether to design APIs for ease of human use or for ease of use by an LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. This means considering how function names, keyword arguments, and responses can be optimized for AI understanding, potentially diverging from traditional human readability standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

## Data and Competition

The success of these general AI models is heavily dependent on the sheer volume and quality of [[Training and finetuning processes for AI models|training data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. Companies are actively competing to acquire more and more data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. Large corporations like Facebook, Google, and Twitter possess massive proprietary datasets that are not accessible to companies like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. This suggests a future where different LLMs will be trained on varying types of [[Open Source vs Proprietary AI Models|proprietary data]], leading to specialized strengths <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. However, the current observation is that the GPT model trained on the most data tends to perform the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

The demonstrated capability of GPT-4 to answer highly specific and even obscure questions without prior exposure to a particular document highlights the growing power of generalist AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>. This suggests that for general information retrieval, a powerful general AI like GPT-4 is often superior to dedicated PDF-specific tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.

The paper "From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts" from Google DeepMind, released on August 2, 2023, introduces Soft Mixture of Experts (Soft MoE) as an advancement in [[mixture_of_experts_technology | Mixture of Experts]] (MoE) technology. This research builds upon earlier work, including "Sparse Mixture of Experts" (2022) and the even earlier "Pathways" (2021) [01:01:13, 01:01:15, 01:01:18, 01:01:50, 01:02:05, 01:02:08, 01:02:11, 01:16:17].

## What is a Mixture of Experts?
[[mixture_of_experts_technology | Mixture of Experts]] (MoE) architectures are designed to scale model capacity without significantly increasing training or inference costs [04:12:12, 04:14:16]. Larger models generally incur higher training and inference costs due to more neurons and parameters requiring extensive computation and memory [04:30:30, 04:32:32, 04:34:34, 04:36:36, 04:38:38, 04:43:43, 04:45:45, 04:47:47, 04:49:49, 04:53:53]. MoEs address this by replacing dense feed-forward network (FFN) layers (also known as Multi-Layer Perceptrons or MLPs) within [[challenges_and_insights_in_transformer_architecture_and_training | Transformer architecture]] with multiple independent "experts" [09:54:54, 09:57:57, 09:59:59, 10:01:01, 10:04:04, 10:06:06, 10:09:09, 10:13:13, 10:14:14].

The core intuition behind MoE is that much of the computation in dense neural networks is "wasted" [10:51:51]. Many neurons' activations are close to zero, meaning only a small subset of pathways truly contribute to the final prediction [11:22:22, 11:24:24, 11:27:27, 11:28:28, 11:30:30, 11:33:33, 11:36:36, 11:38:38, 11:41:41, 11:43:43, 11:44:44]. By selectively activating only relevant parts of the network, MoEs achieve better answers at a fraction of the computational cost [12:43:43, 12:46:46, 12:59:59, 13:02:02, 13:03:03].

It is widely believed that OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models utilize a [[mixture_of_experts_technology | Mixture of Experts]] approach, specifically a sparse one pioneered by Google DeepMind [03:22:22, 03:25:25, 03:27:27, 03:29:29, 03:32:32, 03:34:34, 03:37:37, 03:39:39, 03:40:40, 03:44:44, 03:46:46].

### Challenges of Sparse MoE
Despite their success, traditional (sparse) MoEs face several issues:
*   **Training Instability**: Difficulty in stable training [04:55:55].
*   **Token Dropping**: Some input tokens may not be processed by any expert [04:56:56, 05:00:00]. This leads to unassigned tokens [19:58:58, 20:00:00, 20:03:03].
*   **Expert Imbalance**: Some experts receive disproportionately more tokens than others [26:27:27, 26:30:30, 56:27:27, 56:29:29].
*   **Inability to Scale Number of Experts**: Limited scalability for a large number of experts [04:58:58, 02:22:22]. Most works train with only a few dozen experts [27:48:48, 27:50:50].
*   **Ineffective Fine-tuning**: Issues in adapting the model to new tasks [05:00:00].
*   **Discrete Routing**: The process of deciding which modules (experts) apply to each input token is a discrete optimization problem, often relying on non-differentiable operations like `top-K` or `argmax` [18:00:00, 18:02:02, 21:21:21, 21:23:23, 21:25:25, 52:44:44, 52:46:46, 52:47:47, 53:00:00, 53:02:02, 53:12:12, 53:14:14]. This makes gradient propagation and learning difficult [53:54:54, 53:58:58].
*   **Batch Effects**: The routing decision for a token can be influenced by other inputs in the same batch, leading to non-deterministic outputs. If an expert's capacity is full, tokens may be routed suboptimally [27:58:58, 28:00:00, 28:02:02, 28:04:04, 100:07:07, 100:10:10, 100:12:12, 100:14:14, 100:16:16, 100:20:20, 100:22:22, 100:24:24, 100:27:27, 100:31:31, 100:34:34, 100:37:37]. This is believed to contribute to GPT-4's non-deterministic behavior [03:01:01, 03:05:05, 03:07:07, 03:09:09].
*   **Heuristic Auxiliary Losses**: Often required to balance expert utilization and minimize unassigned tokens [19:12:12, 19:15:15, 19:16:16, 19:18:18, 19:21:21, 19:23:23, 19:25:25, 19:27:27, 19:30:30, 19:31:31, 19:40:40, 19:42:42, 19:44:44, 19:51:51, 19:54:54, 19:56:56].

## Soft Mixture of Experts (Soft MoE)
Soft MoE proposes a solution to these issues by employing a fully differentiable, sparse [[challenges_and_insights_in_transformer_architecture_and_training | Transformer architecture]] [05:12:12, 05:15:15, 05:17:17, 53:05:05, 53:07:07].

### Core Mechanism
Instead of discrete assignments, Soft MoE performs a "soft assignment" by passing different weighted combinations of *all* input tokens to each expert [06:01:01, 06:05:05, 06:07:07, 06:09:09, 21:26:26, 21:28:28, 21:31:31, 21:54:54, 21:55:55, 21:57:57, 22:54:54, 22:55:55, 29:57:57, 01:03:01, 01:03:03, 01:03:06, 01:13:13, 01:13:14, 01:13:16, 01:13:18, 01:13:20, 01:13:22, 01:13:24, 01:13:26, 01:13:27, 01:13:29, 01:13:30].

1.  **Input Tokens (X)**: An input sequence of M tokens, each with dimensionality D [32:15:15, 32:17:17, 32:20:20, 32:23:23, 32:24:24, 32:27:27].
2.  **Learnable Per-Slot Parameters (Phi)**: Each expert processes P "slots," and each slot has a corresponding D-dimensional vector of learnable parameters (Phi) [33:42:42, 33:47:47, 33:49:49, 33:52:52, 33:55:55, 39:56:56, 49:00:00, 49:03:03, 49:04:04, 49:08:08, 49:11:11, 49:13:13, 49:23:23, 49:26:26, 49:41:41, 49:46:46, 49:49:49, 49:51:51, 49:53:53, 49:58:58, 01:01:56, 01:02:00, 01:02:03, 01:05:00, 01:05:02, 01:05:06].
3.  **Dispatch Weights (D)**: The parameters (Phi) and input tokens (X) are combined (using an Einstein summation `einsum` for efficient tensor multiplication) [34:08:08, 34:11:11, 34:13:13, 34:17:17, 34:40:40, 34:42:42, 34:45:45, 34:48:48, 34:51:51, 35:01:01, 35:06:06, 35:12:12, 35:14:14, 35:16:16, 35:18:18, 35:20:20, 35:25:25, 35:28:28, 35:29:29, 35:31:31, 35:33:33, 35:36:36, 35:40:40, 35:44:44, 35:47:47, 35:50:50, 35:53:53, 35:56:56, 35:57:57, 35:59:59, 39:48:48, 39:53:53, 39:57:57, 40:00:00, 40:06:06, 40:08:08, 40:09:09, 40:13:13, 40:15:15, 40:17:17, 40:19:19, 40:21:21, 40:24:24, 40:26:26, 40:28:28, 40:29:29, 40:31:31, 40:33:33, 40:37:37, 40:38:38, 40:41:41, 40:45:45, 40:47:47, 40:48:48, 40:50:50, 40:52:52, 40:55:55, 40:57:57, 40:59:59, 41:01:01, 41:03:03, 41:05:05, 41:07:07, 41:10:10, 41:12:12, 41:13:13, 41:14:14, 41:16:16, 41:17:17, 41:20:20, 41:22:22, 41:23:23, 41:25:25, 41:27:27, 41:29:29, 41:30:30, 41:31:31, 41:32:32, 41:34:34, 41:35:35, 41:37:37, 41:38:38, 41:41:41, 41:43:43, 41:44:44, 41:47:47, 41:49:49, 41:52:52, 41:55:55, 41:59:59, 42:02:02, 42:05:05, 42:07:07, 42:10:10, 42:12:12, 42:14:14, 42:16:16, 42:17:17, 42:19:19, 42:21:21, 42:23:23, 42:25:25, 42:27:27, 42:29:29, 42:31:31, 42:34:34, 42:35:35, 42:37:37, 42:38:38, 42:42:42, 42:45:45, 42:47:47, 42:50:50, 42:53:53, 42:55:55, 42:57:57, 43:00:00, 43:01:01, 43:04:04, 43:06:06, 43:10:10, 43:14:14, 43:17:17, 43:18:18, 43:21:21, 43:22:22, 43:24:24, 43:26:26, 43:28:28, 43:30:30, 43:33:33, 43:35:35, 43:37:37, 43:40:40, 43:42:42, 43:46:46, 43:49:49, 43:52:52, 43:56:56, 43:57:57, 43:59:59, 44:01:01, 44:05:05, 44:07:07, 44:11:11, 44:15:15, 44:17:17, 44:21:21, 44:24:24, 44:28:28, 44:30:30, 44:34:34, 44:37:37, 44:40:40, 44:44:44, 44:47:47, 44:50:50, 44:52:52, 44:54:54, 44:55:55, 44:58:58, 45:00:00, 45:03:03, 45:07:07, 45:09:09, 45:12:12, 45:14:14, 45:20:20, 45:23:23, 45:24:24, 45:27:27, 45:30:30, 45:34:34, 45:35:35, 45:38:38, 45:41:41, 45:44:44, 45:48:48, 45:50:50, 45:53:53, 45:56:56, 45:57:57, 45:59:59, 46:03:03, 46:04:04, 46:07:07, 46:12:12, 46:14:14, 46:17:17, 46:20:20, 46:22:22, 46:25:25, 46:28:28, 46:30:30, 46:32:32, 46:35:35, 46:37:37, 46:39:39, 46:42:42, 46:44:44, 46:48:48, 46:50:50, 46:53:53, 46:55:55, 46:58:58). A softmax function is then applied to generate dispatch weights (D), which are strictly positive [35:01:01, 35:09:09, 35:12:12, 35:14:14, 56:46:46, 56:48:48, 56:52:52].
4.  **Weighted Input Slots**: These dispatch weights are used to form convex combinations of all M input tokens into P "input slots" for each expert [34:42:42, 34:45:45, 34:48:48, 34:51:51, 35:57:57, 36:00:00, 36:03:03, 36:05:05, 36:07:07, 36:09:09, 36:12:12, 36:15:15, 36:16:16, 36:19:19, 36:20:20, 36:22:22, 36:27:27, 36:29:29, 36:33:33, 36:35:35, 36:37:37, 36:40:40, 36:44:44, 36:47:47, 36:51:51, 36:54:54, 36:57:57, 36:59:59, 37:00:00, 37:03:03, 37:06:06, 37:09:09, 37:11:11, 37:13:13, 37:16:16, 37:21:21, 37:24:24, 37:26:26, 37:29:29, 37:32:32, 37:34:34, 37:35:35, 37:37:37, 37:40:40, 37:43:43, 37:44:44, 37:47:47, 37:50:50, 37:52:52, 37:54:54, 37:56:56, 37:58:58, 38:00:00, 38:01:01, 38:05:05, 38:06:06, 38:08:08, 38:10:10, 38:12:12, 38:13:13, 38:15:15, 38:17:17, 38:19:19, 38:23:23, 38:27:27, 38:30:30, 38:32:32, 38:34:34, 38:36:36, 38:38:38, 38:41:41, 38:44:44, 38:47:47, 38:50:50, 38:52:52, 38:55:55, 38:58:58, 01:01:48, 01:01:51, 01:01:54, 01:01:56, 01:02:00, 01:02:03, 01:02:06, 01:02:09, 01:02:12, 01:02:15, 01:02:18, 01:02:21, 01:02:24, 01:02:27, 01:02:29, 01:02:32, 01:02:35, 01:02:36, 01:02:39, 01:02:41, 01:02:43, 01:02:45, 01:02:48, 01:02:50, 01:02:52, 01:02:54, 01:02:55, 01:02:57,

01:03:43, 01:03:45, 01:03:47, 01:03:48, 01:03:50, 01:03:51, 01:03:53, 01:03:55, 01:03:56, 01:03:58, 01:03:59, 01:04:01, 01:04:03, 01:04:05, 01:04:09, 01:04:11, 01:04:13, 01:04:15, 01:04:17, 01:04:19,

02:59:46, 02:59:48, 02:59:50, 02:59:52, 02:59:55, 02:59:56, 02:59:58, 03:00:01, 03:00:04, 03:00:06, 03:00:07, 03:00:09, 03:00:11, 03:00:14, 03:00:17, 03:00:19, 03:00:20, 03:00:22, 03:00:24, 03:00:27,

03:01:43, 03:01:45, 03:01:46, 03:01:48, 03:01:50, 02:03:03].
5.  **Expert Processing**: Each expert applies its function on these weighted input slots [35:57:57, 35:59:59].
6.  **Combined Weights (C)**: After processing, the outputs from all experts are combined using another set of weights (C), also derived from the parameters (Phi) and input tokens [37:03:03, 37:06:06, 37:09:09, 37:11:11, 37:13:13, 37:16:16, 37:21:21, 37:24:24, 37:26:26, 37:29:29, 37:32:32, 37:34:34, 37:35:35, 37:37:37, 50:53:53, 50:55:55]. This ensures the output sequence has the same dimensionality as the input [38:20:20, 38:22:22, 38:27:27, 38:29:29, 02:16:48, 02:16:50].

This process ensures that every input token *fractionally activates* all model parameters, making all operations continuous and fully differentiable, which enables efficient gradient-based learning [53:05:05, 53:07:07, 53:19:19, 53:21:21, 53:22:22, 53:24:24, 53:26:26, 53:29:29, 53:30:30, 53:32:32, 53:34:34, 53:35:35, 53:37:37, 53:40:40, 53:42:42, 53:46:46, 53:48:48, 53:50:50, 53:52:52, 53:54:54, 53:56:56, 53:58:58, 59:01:01, 59:02:02].

### Architecture Placement
Soft MoE layers typically replace the feed-forward (MLP) blocks in [[challenges_and_insights_in_transformer_architecture_and_training | Transformer encoders]] [38:42:42, 38:55:55, 38:58:58, 01:13:07, 01:13:10, 01:13:11, 01:13:14, 01:13:17, 01:13:18, 01:13:20, 01:13:22, 01:13:23, 01:13:25]. For Vision Transformers (ViT), this means the Soft MoE is applied within the encoder blocks [01:18:14, 01:18:17, 01:18:19].

### Hyperparameters and Optimization
*   **Slots and Experts**: The total number of slots is a key hyperparameter determining the computational cost [39:03:03, 39:06:06, 39:08:08, 39:10:10, 39:12:12, 39:15:15, 39:18:18, 39:19:19, 39:21:21, 39:27:27, 39:29:29, 39:31:31, 39:33:33, 39:34:34, 39:36:36, 39:38:38, 57:47:47, 57:49:49, 57:51:51, 57:53:53, 57:54:54, 57:56:56, 57:58:58, 01:55:00, 01:57:47, 01:57:48, 01:57:50, 01:57:52, 01:57:53, 01:57:54, 01:57:56]. Experiments showed that one slot per expert is generally optimal for performance, as multiple slots per expert tend to align and provide limited informational gains [01:31:37, 01:32:01, 01:32:02, 01:32:19, 01:32:23, 01:32:25, 01:32:29, 01:32:31, 01:32:33, 01:32:37, 01:32:39, 01:32:40, 01:32:42, 01:32:45, 01:32:48, 01:32:50, 01:32:52, 01:32:54, 01:32:57, 01:32:58, 01:33:00, 01:33:02, 01:33:04, 01:33:06, 01:33:08, 01:33:11, 01:33:13, 01:33:16, 01:33:18, 01:33:21, 01:33:22, 01:33:24, 01:33:25, 01:33:27, 01:33:30, 01:33:34, 01:33:36, 01:33:42, 01:33:44, 01:33:46, 01:33:48, 01:33:50, 01:33:53, 01:33:56, 01:33:58, 01:34:01, 01:34:04, 01:34:06, 01:34:08, 01:34:10, 01:34:12, 01:34:14, 01:34:15, 01:34:17, 01:34:18, 01:34:20, 01:34:22, 01:34:24, 01:34:25].
*   **Normalization**: L2 normalization of inputs and learnable per-slot parameters (Phi) enhances stability, especially when scaling model dimensions or increasing learning rates [01:14:10, 01:14:13, 01:14:18, 01:14:21, 01:14:24, 01:14:26, 01:14:29, 01:14:31, 01:14:35, 01:14:37, 01:14:39, 01:14:41, 01:14:43, 01:14:47, 01:14:49, 01:14:52, 01:14:55, 01:14:59, 01:15:02, 01:15:07, 01:15:10, 01:15:12, 01:15:15, 01:15:17, 01:15:18, 01:15:20, 01:15:22, 01:15:24].
*   **Time Complexity**: The computational cost of the Soft MoE layer is dominated by the attention mechanism's quadratic cost with respect to sequence length [01:09:51, 01:09:54, 01:10:10, 01:10:11, 01:10:15, 01:10:18, 01:10:19, 01:10:22, 01:10:34, 01:10:36, 01:10:38, 01:10:40, 01:10:43]. Soft MoE is significantly faster than other sparse MoE methods because it avoids slow sorting or `top-K` operations [01:58:20, 01:58:31, 01:58:37].

## Experimental Results
The paper presents extensive experiments using Vision Transformers (ViT) on large-scale datasets, primarily JFT-4B (an internal Google dataset with over 4 billion images) [01:37:16, 01:37:20, 01:37:26, 01:37:29, 01:37:32, 01:37:34, 01:38:08, 01:38:10, 01:38:13, 01:38:15].

*   **Dominant Performance**: Soft MoE consistently "dominates" (outperforms in every metric) dense ViT models and other sparse MoE variants (Token Choice, Expert Choice) across various model sizes and training budgets [01:36:08, 01:36:12, 01:36:16, 01:36:20, 01:36:22, 01:36:24, 01:36:26, 01:36:28, 01:36:30, 01:36:32, 01:36:43, 01:36:44, 01:36:48, 01:36:50, 01:57:31, 01:57:34, 01:57:36, 01:57:37, 01:57:42, 01:57:43, 01:57:45]. It achieves significant improvements in inference speed and absolute performance [01:36:43, 01:36:44, 01:36:48].
*   **Scaling and Over-training**: Soft MoE models can be trained for much longer than traditional models, continuing to improve performance where others typically plateau or overfit (following standard scaling laws) [01:48:28, 01:48:30, 01:48:31, 01:48:33, 01:48:35, 01:48:37, 01:48:39, 01:50:52, 01:50:55, 01:50:57, 01:50:59, 01:51:01, 01:51:02].
*   **Computational Efficiency**: A smaller Soft MoE model (e.g., Soft MoE B16) can match the quality of a much larger dense ViT (e.g., ViT-H14) while being 10 times cheaper at inference [01:50:41, 01:50:43, 01:50:44, 01:50:46, 01:50:48, 01:50:49, 01:52:14, 01:52:16, 01:52:18, 01:57:21, 01:57:23, 01:57:25, 01:57:28].
*   **Ablation Studies**: Even simple routing mechanisms (e.g., identity or uniform mixing) within an MoE setup can outperform a dense [[challenges_and_insights_in_transformer_architecture_and_training | Transformer]] [02:05:42, 02:05:44, 02:05:46, 02:05:48, 02:05:50, 02:05:52, 02:05:54, 02:05:55, 02:05:57, 02:05:58, 02:06:04, 02:06:05, 02:06:07, 02:06:09, 02:06:13, 02:06:15, 02:06:19, 02:06:21].
*   **Semantic Specialization**: The learnable parameters allow individual slots (and by extension, experts, when one slot per expert is used) to specialize in processing specific semantic concepts, such as parts of an image (e.g., a bird's bill, head, or background) [02:16:58, 02:17:00, 02:17:03, 02:17:04, 02:17:05, 02:17:07, 02:17:08, 02:17:10, 02:17:18, 02:17:20, 02:17:22, 02:17:23, 02:17:24, 02:17:37, 02:17:40, 02:17:43, 02:17:45, 02:17:46, 02:17:49, 02:17:51, 02:17:52, 02:17:55, 02:17:58, 02:18:01, 02:18:03, 02:18:05, 02:18:07, 02:18:09, 02:18:13, 02:18:15, 02:18:17, 02:18:18, 02:18:21, 02:18:23, 02:18:24, 02:18:31, 02:18:33, 02:18:35, 02:18:38, 02:18:39, 02:18:42, 02:18:44, 02:18:46, 02:18:49, 02:18:52, 02:18:54, 02:18:58, 02:19:01, 02:19:06, 02:19:09, 02:19:11, 02:19:12, 02:19:15, 02:19:17, 02:19:18, 02:19:20, 02:19:22, 02:19:24, 02:19:27, 02:19:28, 02:20:00, 02:20:02, 02:20:05, 02:20:08, 02:20:11, 02:20:14, 02:20:16, 02:20:20, 02:20:22, 02:20:25, 02:20:26].
*   **Contrastive Learning**: The learned representations from Soft MoE models significantly improve performance in tasks like [[diffusion_models_and_transformers | Image-Text Alignment]] (e.g., CLIP-like models), even when the image encoder is frozen [01:19:19, 01:19:22, 01:19:23, 01:19:24, 01:19:26, 01:19:27, 01:19:30, 01:19:32, 01:19:35, 01:19:37, 01:19:38, 01:19:40, 01:19:41, 01:19:42, 01:19:45, 01:19:47, 01:19:48, 01:19:50, 01:19:52, 02:06:42, 02:06:44, 02:06:46, 02:06:47, 02:06:50, 02:06:53, 02:06:55, 02:06:57, 02:06:59, 02:07:00, 02:07:02, 02:07:04, 02:07:06, 02:07:08, 02:07:10, 02:07:13, 02:07:15, 02:07:16, 02:07:21, 02:07:24, 02:07:27, 02:07:29, 02:07:33, 02:07:36, 02:07:38, 02:07:40, 02:07:41, 02:07:42, 02:07:45, 02:07:47, 02:07:48, 02:07:50, 02:07:52, 02:07:56, 02:07:58, 02:08:00, 02:08:01, 02:08:04, 02:08:06, 02:08:08, 02:08:12, 02:08:14, 02:08:15, 02:08:19, 02:08:21, 02:08:22, 02:08:25, 02:08:27, 02:08:29, 02:08:31, 02:08:33, 02:08:36, 02:08:38, 02:08:44, 02:08:47, 02:08:49, 02:08:52, 02:08:54, 02:08:56, 02:08:58, 02:09:00, 02:09:02, 02:09:06, 02:09:09, 02:09:11, 02:09:14, 02:09:15, 02:09:17, 02:09:19, 02:09:22, 02:09:24, 02:09:30, 02:09:32, 02:09:35, 02:09:38, 02:09:43, 02:09:44, 02:09:46, 02:09:48, 02:09:53, 02:09:58, 02:10:00, 02:10:01, 02:10:04, 02:10:10, 02:10:14, 02:10:17, 02:10:19, 02:10:21, 02:10:24, 02:10:25, 02:10:27, 02:10:29, 02:10:33, 02:10:35, 02:10:39, 02:10:41, 02:10:44, 02:10:47, 02:10:50, 02:10:52, 02:10:54, 02:10:56, 02:10:58, 02:11:01, 02:11:02, 02:11:04, 02:11:06, 02:11:07, 02:11:09, 02:11:11, 02:11:14, 02:11:17, 02:11:19, 02:11:20, 02:11:22, 02:11:24, 02:11:27, 02:11:29, 02:11:30, 02:11:32, 02:11:33, 02:11:37, 02:11:39, 02:11:41, 02:11:43, 02:11:46, 02:11:50, 02:11:51, 02:11:53].

## Limitations and Future Work
*   **Auto-regressive Decoders**: A key limitation is the difficulty in applying Soft MoE to auto-regressive decoders, such as those found in language models. The causal masking required in decoders (to prevent future tokens from influencing current predictions) conflicts with Soft MoE's mechanism of combining all tokens [01:28:01, 01:28:03, 01:28:06, 01:28:08, 01:28:12, 01:28:14, 01:28:15, 01:28:19, 01:28:21, 01:28:22, 01:28:27, 01:28:29, 01:28:31, 01:29:01, 01:29:04, 01:29:06, 01:29:09, 01:29:12, 01:29:15, 01:29:18, 01:29:20, 01:29:22, 01:29:24, 02:22:57, 02:22:59, 02:23:00, 02:23:02]. This is left as a promising area for future research [01:28:42, 01:28:44, 01:28:46].
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimal selection of hyperparameters (e.g., number of slots, number of experts) is complex and dependent on specific hardware configurations, including interconnects for distributed training [01:19:03, 01:19:05, 01:19:10, 01:19:12, 01:19:13, 01:19:15, 01:19:18, 01:19:20, 01:19:22, 01:19:23, 01:19:25, 01:19:27, 01:19:31, 01:19:32, 01:19:35, 01:19:37, 01:19:38, 01:19:39, 01:19:41].
*   **Integration with Other Techniques**: The paper also notes that integrating [[application_of_lora_in_transformer_architectures | LoRA]] (Low-Rank Adaptation) with MoEs would likely require a separate [[application_of_lora_in_transformer_architectures | LoRA]] for each expert [01:48:46, 01:48:47, 01:48:52, 01:48:55, 01:48:58, 01:49:00, 01:49:04, 01:49:06, 01:49:12, 01:49:13, 01:49:16, 01:49:18, 01:49:20].

Overall, Soft MoE presents a powerful and efficient approach to scaling [[challenges_and_insights_in_transformer_architecture_and_training | Transformer models]], demonstrating superior performance and computational benefits across various benchmarks, and highlighting how optimization of FFNs converges towards attention-like mechanisms [02:23:59, 02:24:00, 02:24:02, 02:24:06, 02:24:07, 02:24:09, 02:24:11, 02:24:14, 02:24:17, 02:24:18, 02:24:21, 02:24:23, 02:24:24].

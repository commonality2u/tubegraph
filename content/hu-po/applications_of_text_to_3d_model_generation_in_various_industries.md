## Overview and Impact
[[text_to_3d_content_generation | Text to 3D model generation]], particularly using diffusion models like [[DreamFusion for text to 3d model generation | DreamFusion]], is poised to be highly disruptive to various industries. While 2D image generation has already shown significant impact on the art community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, [[text_to_3d_content_generation | 3D generation]] is anticipated to be "absolutely insane" due to its potential to revolutionize workflows where 3D modeling is typically very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The ability to create 3D models from simple text prompts is a major advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Specific Industries and Professions

### Video Games
The video game industry is one area where [[text_to_3d_content_generation | 3D generation]] is expected to have a massive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Generating 3D assets for games often involves complex and time-consuming 3D modeling processes, which can be significantly streamlined by text-to-3D capabilities.

### 3D Modeling Profession
Many individuals make their living through 3D modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The emergence of [[text_to_3d_content_generation | text to 3D model generation]] could profoundly disrupt this profession, as models can potentially be created with minimal effort from a text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Future Directions and Potential
The speaker believes that [[text_to_3d_content_generation | 3D diffusion models]] will be "absolutely massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. This technology is seen as a key component of future developments like the [[potential_applications_and_future_directions_in_3d_scene_representations | metaverse]], where users could interact with VR headsets to generate desired virtual content through speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. This represents a significant step towards creating interactive and dynamic 3D environments on demand.

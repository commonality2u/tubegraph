A recent paper has caused significant excitement in the scientific community by claiming the synthesis of the "first room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor" named LK-99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This discovery, if verified, could usher in a new era for humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## What is a Superconductor?
A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity with zero resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Unlike conventional conductors like copper, which exhibit some resistance and dissipate energy as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, superconductors allow electrical current to flow indefinitely without energy loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

### Historical Context
Superconductors have been created before, but they typically require extremely low temperatures (supercooling, often with liquid nitrogen) or incredibly high pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. These demanding conditions have limited their practical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Previous attempts to achieve room-temperature superconductivity involved materials like hydrogen sulfide and yttrium superhydride, but these still required tremendously high pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

A well-known phenomenon associated with superconductors is the [[Meissner effect and magnetic levitation | Meissner effect]], where a superconductor repels magnetic fields, allowing it to levitate above a magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. This effect is often demonstrated by dipping a magnet in liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## The LK-99 Discovery
The paper "First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor" introduces LK-99, a modified lead apatite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. "Ambient pressure" refers to the normal atmospheric pressure we experience daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Key Properties of LK-99
LK-99 exhibits:
*   Critical temperature (Tc) greater than or equal to 400 Kelvin (127 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Zero resistivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, meeting international standards of 10^-11 ohms per centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   A critical current.
*   A critical magnetic field.
*   The [[Meissner effect and magnetic levitation | Meissner effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The ability to levitate a small piece of this metal at room temperature and ambient pressure serves as primary proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## The Mechanism: Structural Distortion
The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from a minute structural distortion caused by a slight volume shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### [[Material science and crystal structures related to superconductivity | Crystal Structure]] and Composition
*   The base material is a lead apatite, which is a [[Material science and crystal structures related to superconductivity | crystal structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, specifically hexagonal with a size of approximately one nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.
*   The distortion is caused by the substitution of copper (Cu) for lead (Pb) ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, specifically replacing one of four Pb2 ions with Cu2 ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.
*   Copper ions are smaller than lead ions, leading to a volume reduction of about 0.48% in the [[Material science and crystal structures related to superconductivity | crystal lattice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   This shrinkage generates stress within the material's [[Material science and crystal structures related to superconductivity | crystal lattice]], specifically shifting the lead atoms (Pb1) in the a-axis plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.
*   This specific stress creates "superconducting quantum wells" (SQWs) within the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. These are tiny confined spaces where electrons can move together without resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   Electrons are believed to tunnel between these SQWs, contributing to the material's overall superconductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>.

Both are described as relatively cheap and readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>.
2.  **Mixing:** The materials are uniformly mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio using an agate mortar and pestle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:38">[01:43:38]</a>.
3.  **Baking:** The mixture is sealed in a reaction tube under vacuum and baked at 925 degrees Celsius for 10 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:56">[01:44:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:02">[01:45:02]</a>.
4.  **Result:** A dark gray ingot is obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>, which can be shaped into thin cuboids for measurements or pulverized into powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:16">[01:45:16]</a>.

## Introduction: The Mystery of Q\*

Q\* (Q-star) is a rumored algorithm from OpenAI that is believed to represent a "step function improvement" in the current state of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While shrouded in mystery, its name, particularly the "Q," strongly suggests a connection to the Q-function and Q-learning, fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. This article explores the theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language models]] can be interpreted as optimal Q functions, potentially revealing the underlying nature of Q\*.

## Yann LeCun's Perspective

According to Yann LeCun, a prominent AI researcher, "Q\*" is likely OpenAI's attempt at planning, a concept deeply rooted in reinforcement learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. He suggests that every top AI lab, including Facebook AI Research (Meta), DeepMind (Google), and OpenAI (Microsoft), is working on similar ideas, with some already having published results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

LeCun's earlier "cake analogy" proposed that self-supervised learning would form the bulk of AGI, with reinforcement learning being a "little cherry on top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. However, a more recent tweet from LeCun suggests a shift, stating that "agency and planning can't be a wart on top of auto regressive llms it must be an intrinsic property of the architecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This apparent contradiction highlights the evolving understanding of how reinforcement learning integrates with [[Advancements in language models | large language models]].

## Evidence from Recent Research Papers

Two papers released in April 2024 offer significant insights into how [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language models]] can function as or be optimized by methods analogous to Q-functions and reinforcement learning.

### Paper 1: "Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via Imagination, Searching, and Criticizing"

Authored by Tencent AI Lab, this paper introduces AlphaLLM, a framework that applies principles from AlphaGo to [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

#### Current LLM Improvement Strategies
Currently, [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLM]] performance is primarily enhanced through advanced prompting techniques (like Chain of Thought) and fine-tuning with high-quality data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. However, these methods are limited by data availability and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

#### AlphaLLM: Self-Improvement via Reinforcement Learning
AlphaLLM enables [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLMs]] to refine outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards, leading to self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It adapts Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a core component of AlphaGo, for [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

**Challenges in applying MCTS to LLMs**:
*   **Vast Search Spaces**: Natural language has a huge action space (e.g., 30,000 possible tokens at each step) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Data Scarcity**: Unlike Go, where expert games are abundant, high-quality human-annotated data for [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLM]] self-improvement is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Subjective Feedback**: Defining a clear "win" or "loss" signal for general language tasks is difficult, unlike deterministic games like Go or Tic-Tac-Toe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

**Key Components of AlphaLLM**:
1.  **Imagination Component**: Generates potential responses.
2.  **Efficient Search Component (nMCTS)**: Searches for high-quality trajectories, guided by "critics" (value functions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

**Option-Level MCTS**:
To mitigate the vast search space, AlphaLLM introduces option-level MCTS, where actions are not individual tokens but sequences of tokens (like sentences), determined by a "termination function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. This allows for more efficient exploration of the search space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.

**Critics and Value Functions**:
AlphaLLM employs different types of critics to provide guidance:
*   **Process Reward Model (PRM)**: Provides feedback for each step in a Chain of Thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.
*   **Outcome Reward Model (OMM)**: Provides feedback only on the final result of a complete trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.
*   **Value Function**: Approximates the expected cumulative future rewards of a given state and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

Crucially, these critics are initialized from a pre-trained [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language model]] itself, demonstrating that [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLMs]] can serve as value functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

**Self-Improvement Loop**:
The self-improvement loop in AlphaLLM consists of:
1.  **Data Generation**: MCTS is used to explore potential trajectories and identify high-quality responses based on critic scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
2.  **Policy Fine-tuning**: The generated high-quality data is then used to fine-tune the [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLM]] policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. This iterative process allows the model to generate progressively better data and improve its own performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.

**Results and Limitations**:
AlphaLLM, starting with a Llama 2 70B model, achieved significant improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K (from 57 to 92) and MATH (from 20 to 51) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This performance is comparable to GPT-4 *specifically on math tasks* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Caveat
> These impressive results are primarily achieved when using MCTS during inference, not merely from an intrinsically "smarter" base model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. The improvements are limited to domains where a clear reward signal (correct/incorrect answer) is available, such as math and coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. A key limitation is that the critic models remain static during the training process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.

### Paper 2: "From R to Q\*: Your Language Model is Secretly a Q Function"

From Stanford University, this paper provides theoretical backing for the connection between [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language models]] and Q-functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

#### DPO as Q-Learning
The paper demonstrates that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a popular method for fine-tuning [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLMs]] based on human preferences, is effectively a Q-learning algorithm when interpreted at the token level within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. DPO treats the entire response as a single "arm" in a contextual bandit problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

> [!INFO] Bandits in RL
> The "bandit problem" refers to a scenario where an agent must choose between multiple options (slot machine "arms"), each with an unknown probability distribution of rewards. The goal is to maximize cumulative reward over time by balancing exploration (trying new arms) and exploitation (choosing the seemingly best arm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

The authors show that standard search algorithms like beam search (a variant of MCTS) yield significant improvements over a base DPO policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>, echoing the findings of the Tencent paper.

#### Key Theoretical Contributions
*   **LLM as Optimal Soft Q-Function**: The paper formally proves that an [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLM]] is always the optimal soft Q-function for some reward function in the token-level MDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. This means that even if not explicitly trained as such, an [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLM]]'s internal workings align with the mathematical framework of Q-functions.
*   **Discrete vs. Continuous Space**: This interpretation is particularly relevant because natural language, with its limited vocabulary of tokens, is a discrete space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. This makes applying discrete reinforcement learning methods more straightforward.
*   **Credit Assignment**: The paper provides qualitative evidence that DPO can learn "credit assignment" directly from feedback data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:59">[01:32:59]</a>. Credit assignment is the challenge of attributing success or failure to specific actions in a long sequence, rather than just the final outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:33:18]</a>.
*   **Explaining DPO Phenomena**: This theoretical reframing helps explain empirical phenomena observed in DPO training, such as the counter-intuitive decrease in the likelihood of chosen responses over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

## The Q\* Hypothesis: Beyond Math and Coding

The speaker's "conspiracy theory" regarding Q\* is that Ilya Sutskever, a key figure at OpenAI, might have "figured out how to use a pre-train [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language model]] as a Q function in a more generic set of tasks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. This would extend the self-play loop's success beyond domains with clear, deterministic rewards (like math and coding) to general natural language reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.

If this hypothesis is true, Q\* would enable [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLMs]] to generate synthetic data sets of language that are "better than expert human data sets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>, leading to truly superhuman language abilities. If not, Q\* might simply be GPT-4 with enhanced math and programming capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

## Implications and Future Directions

The ability to interpret and train [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language models]] as Q functions has profound implications:

*   **Robotics and Embodied AGI**: The concepts of discrete action spaces, reward signals, and credit assignment are directly applicable to robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. If an [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLM]] can output action tokens for a robot, and robot actions have clear success/failure outcomes, then the same self-play loops could lead to superhuman [[Generalization in robotics using language models | embodied AGI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. This is a major reason why top researchers are leaving established companies to found humanoid robotics startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Agentic LLMs**: The optimal exploration behavior derived from Q-function learning could enable [[Large Language Models and Optimization | LLM]] agents to make more intelligent decisions and trajectories, similar to how robots explore their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.
*   **Prompt Refinement**: Q-functions could be used to evaluate and improve the quality of prompts for generative models, such as those used for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>.

The consistent message from both theoretical and empirical papers is that reinforcement learning methods, particularly those involving search and value functions, are critical for extracting peak performance from [[Large Language Models and Optimization | language models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. While the exact nature of Q\* remains a secret, its likely foundation lies in this powerful convergence of reinforcement learning and [[Large Language Models and Optimization | large language models]].

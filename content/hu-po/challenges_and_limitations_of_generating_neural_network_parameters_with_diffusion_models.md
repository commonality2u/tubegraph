The concept of [[Neural network diffusion and applications|neural network diffusion]], also referred to as generative models of neural network checkpoints or weight space diffusion, is an early and novel area of AI research focusing on training [[diffusion models and image generation|diffusion models]] to directly generate neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>. While promising, this paradigm faces significant challenges and limitations that currently restrict its practical application beyond toy problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:52">[01:36:52]</a>.

## Limitations due to Model Size and Dimensionality

A primary limitation is the inability to generate parameters for large, modern neural network architectures:
*   Currently, [[latent diffusion models for generating neural network parameters|diffusion models]] for neural networks work only for "very small models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   Researchers are not generating parameters for models like GPT-4, but rather for very simple image classification models such as ResNet-18 (a very old model) on datasets like CIFAR-100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   The primary constraint is GPU memory, as the memory cost of flattening model parameters into one-dimensional vectors (V) is "too heavy" when the dimension of V is "ultra large" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
*   This makes it challenging to train an encoder-decoder for ginormous initial representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.
*   The generated models are typically very small, consisting of only a couple of layers in a multi-layer perceptron or a small ResNet-18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
*   Even when using [[latent diffusion models and architectures|latent diffusion models]] that compress parameters into a smaller latent space, they are still limited to either generating only the last two layers of architectures like ViT Tiny or small ResNet-18s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.

## Data Availability and Consistency Challenges

Acquiring sufficient and diverse training data for diffusion models is another significant hurdle:
*   Training a diffusion model to learn the distribution of model parameters requires a "huge data set of model parameters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   Unlike image datasets, which are abundant, obtaining large datasets of fully trained neural network model parameters is "much more difficult" due to their scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   The parameter space for different neural network architectures is inconsistent; for example, the parameter space of a ResNet-18 is completely different from that of a GPT-4 in terms of dimensionality and number of parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   Current research typically uses "very small" datasets, sometimes as small as 500 trained neural networks, making the models prone to [[overfitting|overfitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.
*   To mitigate the issue of small datasets, data augmentation techniques like adding noise to parameters or latent representations are employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. Permuting the order of weights and biases in flattened vectors is another clever augmentation used to address translational invariance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>.

## Architectural and Operational Constraints

The underlying components of the diffusion process itself present limitations:
*   The [[latent diffusion models and architectures|autoencoder]] and [[latent diffusion models and architectures|latent diffusion model]] architectures used are often simple, such as a four-layer one-dimensional convolutional neural network (ConvNet), which may not be sophisticated enough for complex parameter spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   The process of generating model parameters directly does not rely on differentiability, which, while opening new architectural possibilities, also removes the inherent structure imposed by gradient-based optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:51">[03:00:51]</a>.
*   The method of tokenizing model parameters (e.g., flattening them into a single vector and chunking them) is considered "naive" and likely ripe for more sophisticated approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   While [[conditional diffusion models for neural networks|conditional diffusion models]] allow for specifying desired metrics (like low loss), the trajectories in parameter space can be "weird" compared to the smoother paths of gradient descent, indicating less predictable exploration of the loss landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite these challenges, the ability to generate neural network parameters directly with [[applications of diffusion models in small model and neural field generation|diffusion models]] holds immense potential as a fundamentally different paradigm for creating neural networks, moving away from traditional gradient descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>. The current proof-of-concept works, such as those generating small classification models or parameters for NeRFs, highlight a tangible use case where small model size is not a prohibitive factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:27">[01:43:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. The field is still nascent, with much unexplored territory in [[scalability of Transformerbased diffusion models|scaling and optimization in diffusion models]] and parameter tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>. Addressing these limitations could pave the way for generating complex, potentially sparse or quantized, large language models directly, offering a significant leap in efficiency by bypassing lengthy training processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>.

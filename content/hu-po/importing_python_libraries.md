Importing [[python_nerf_libraries | Python libraries]] is a fundamental step when setting up environments for projects like NerfStudio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The process often involves managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility between different library versions.

## Challenges with Library Imports

During the setup of NerfStudio, several challenges related to importing [[python_nerf_libraries | Python libraries]] were encountered:

*   **`torchsix` Incompatibility**
    *   An error indicating "no module named torch six" arose because PyTorch 2.0 no longer supports `torchsix` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>. The solution involved specifying an older version of PyTorch during installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>.
*   **`tcnn` (Tiny CUDA NN) Issues**
    *   Errors like "name tcnn is not defined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a> and "undefined symbol `_ZN5cuda9caching8allocator9set_limitEv`" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a> repeatedly occurred when attempting to import `tiny Cuda nn` as `tcnn` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. These issues suggested an incompatibility between the installed PyTorch version and the `tiny Cuda nn` library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:45">[01:59:45]</a>.
    *   Attempts to resolve this included:
        *   Building `tiny Cuda nn` from source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:21">[02:02:21]</a>.
        *   Setting `cmake Cuda architectures` to match the specific GPU (e.g., `61` for a 1080 series GPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
        *   Ensuring correct `CUDA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:34">[02:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
        *   Reinstalling PyTorch and its related libraries (`torchvision`, `funtorch`) with a specific CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 11.6 to match the system's CUDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:19">[02:03:19]</a>.

## Methods of Installation and Import

*   **Standard Python Imports:** Libraries like `NerfStudio` can be imported directly using `import Nerf Studio` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Conditional Imports:** When troubleshooting, specific Python interpreter commands can be used to test imports, such as `python import tcnn` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a> or `python import tiny Cuda nn as tcnn` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>.
*   **Docker for Environment Management:** To mitigate complex dependency issues, using Docker images can provide a more controlled environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Docker containers can mount volumes for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>, open ports for viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>, and manage memory allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. Building a custom Docker image allows specifying the target CUDA architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.

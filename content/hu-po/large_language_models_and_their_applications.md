[[large_language_models_and_their_applications | Large Language Models]] (LLMs) are being developed for a wide range of applications, including fully automated scientific discovery. These models leverage advancements in generative AI and various techniques to perform complex tasks previously thought to be exclusive to humans.

## Capabilities and Applications

LLMs demonstrate capabilities beyond simple text generation, extending into areas of creativity, code manipulation, and scientific reasoning.

### Automated Scientific Discovery
A comprehensive framework utilizing LLMs enables fully automatic scientific discovery, encompassing multiple stages of the research process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This process includes:
*   **Idea Generation** LLMs can generate novel research ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This capability relies on the generative nature of modern AI, allowing the models to find new permutations and combinations of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Novelty checks are performed using databases like Semantic Scholar to ensure ideas haven't been previously explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Code Generation and Experiment Execution** LLMs can write code, execute experiments, and visualize results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. For machine learning research, this is possible because experiments can be conducted entirely on a computer without physical interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The system modifies an existing code base rather than writing code from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The state-of-the-art open-source coding assistant, AER, was used, which has an 18.9% success rate on the SBench software engineer benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Paper Writing** LLMs can describe findings by writing a full scientific paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. They can consult external databases like Semantic Scholar for related works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a> and fill in text using existing LaTeX templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Peer Review Simulation** The framework includes a simulated review process for evaluation of the generated papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. A GPT-4 based agent conducts paper reviews based on common conference criteria (e.g., NeurIPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. This reviewer was evaluated against 500 ICLR 2022 papers and achieved "superhuman F1 scores and human-level AUC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

This automated scientific process has been applied to diffusion modeling, Transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics in machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Other Specific Applications
*   **Multimodal Agents:** Some LLMs, like Mirol 3B, function as [[multimodal_large_language_models | multimodal agents]] that integrate video, audio, and text, and possess external memory capabilities, resembling a memory cache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Legal Applications:** Specific LLMs have been released for law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Humanities Research:** Automated AI research is likely to be easier to explore in social sciences and humanities, as their search space is primarily text-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Key Techniques
LLM capabilities are enhanced by specific frameworks and techniques:
*   **Chain of Thought:** Allows the LLM to have context and produce intermediate tokens to improve the quality of desired outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Self-Reflection:** Enables the LLM to review its own output, judge it, and select the best options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This is also used for refinement, such as reducing verbosity in generated papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.
*   **Generation and Filtering:** A common strategy involves generating a high volume of ideas (even "weird tokens" or "hallucinations") and then filtering them to retain only the good ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This is also seen in systems like AlphaGeometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Model Agnosticism:** Designing workflows that allow easy swapping of underlying [[large_language_models_and_their_applications | foundation models]] is beneficial, as it allows systems to improve as LLM capabilities advance without significant code changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Leading LLMs
When compared across different tasks, some LLMs consistently perform better than others:
*   **Sonnet and GPT-4o** are frequently at the top of performance lists for tasks like scientific paper writing and review, and [[multimodal_large_language_models | vision language models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Llama 3.1 405B** generally performs worse overall but offers more convenient API access, avoiding rate limits from other providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.
*   **DeepSeek Coder** is significantly cheaper but often fails to correctly call tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
The application of LLMs, especially in open-ended tasks like scientific discovery, presents several challenges:
*   **Hallucination:** LLMs can generate incorrect or fabricated details, such as false GPU types or PyTorch versions, which impacts reproducibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   **Evaluation and Verification:** It is increasingly difficult for humans to verify the factual correctness and novelty of complex outputs from LLMs, especially as models become more sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. This leads to issues akin to "super alignment," where humans struggle to supervise AI systems smarter than themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **True Novelty vs. Optimization:** LLMs may present improvements that are merely a result of increasing model size or computational complexity, rather than genuine scientific insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. For example, an LLM might double the parameters of a model, leading to better performance simply because it's larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Ethical Concerns:** Issues arise regarding transparency (e.g., whether AI-generated papers should be marked as such) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a> and the potential for LLMs to exhibit self-preservation or resource acquisition behaviors, such as relaunching themselves or attempting to extend time limits to avoid termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Safe code execution environments (like containerization) are recommended to mitigate these risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.
*   **Data Contamination:** When using closed-source LLMs, there's a risk that the model may have been trained on the very data it is asked to evaluate, leading to skewed results rather than genuine assessment of merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The increasing capabilities of LLMs suggest a future where AI plays a dominant role in scientific research.
*   The cost of generating papers via LLM APIs is currently around $10 to $15 per paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>, with LLM API calls being the primary cost, rather than the compute for running experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.
*   Future [[multimodal_large_language_models | foundation models]] are expected to integrate vision capabilities, allowing them to process both text and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.
*   The integration of LLMs with [[large_language_models_in_robotics | cloud robotics and automation in physical lab spaces]] will enable their application in harder sciences like biology and physics, where real-world experiments are necessary for hypothesis verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.
*   There is a shift from traditional code engineering to "flow engineering," where humans design the prompts and information flow within a system, allowing LLMs to execute the tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>. However, it's anticipated that AI systems will eventually be better at creating these workflows themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>.

The role of human scientists may diminish as AI systems surpass human capabilities in scientific research, potentially leading to a future where scientific progress is entirely driven by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. The format of scientific papers may also evolve, becoming optimized for AI-to-AI communication rather than human readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

**Speech2Speech** is an application developed by Hugo that enables the creation and interaction with AI-generated conversations featuring various personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The system can simulate discussions between famous figures such as Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Elon Musk, with the user able to embody one of the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## How it Works

The user initiates a conversation by recording their audio input, which is then automatically transcribed into text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Additional conversation bubbles are generated by [[using_gpt_api_for_conversation_generation | GPT via the API]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, with responses tailored to the selected character's persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Users can continuously add more dialogue to build out the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Playback and Export

Once a conversation is created, it can be played back through the computer's speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The application also supports [[exporting_and_sharing_audio_from_ai_conversations | exporting the audio]] to a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, which can then be used on other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Character Customization

Speech2Speech allows users to change characters to "literally anybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. To add a new personality, users must provide:
*   A name for the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   A description outlining the character's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   A list of audio references, typically 60 seconds to two minutes of audio from any YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

This feature means that users are not limited to famous individuals, and can create conversations with anyone for whom a 30-second audio clip can be found on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Technical Requirements and Setup

[[Requirements and setup for using Speech2Speech AI | To use Speech2Speech]], an OpenAI API key and an Eleven Labs API key are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The estimated initial cost for these API keys is around five dollars for Eleven Labs and twenty dollars for OpenAI, totaling approximately 25 dollars to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The application does not require local GPUs, as all processing occurs via API, making it runnable on less powerful computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Development Status

The application is still under development, and the creator welcomes suggestions for new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The project's code is available on GitHub under an MIT license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

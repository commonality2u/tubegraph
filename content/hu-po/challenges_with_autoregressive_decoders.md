Making [[Soft Mixture of Experts | Soft Moe]] (Soft Mixture of Experts) architectures work effectively with [[visual_autoregressive_modeling | autoregressive decoders]] presents significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>. This area is considered a promising research avenue for future work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.

## Preserving Causality in Decoders
A core challenge stems from the requirement to preserve causality between past and future tokens during training in [[visual_autoregressive_modeling | autoregressive decoders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.

### Conflict with Soft Moe's Merging Mechanism
The [[Soft Mixture of Experts | soft Moe]] approach operates by smartly merging *all* tokens in the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:55">[01:27:55]</a>. This conflicts with the fundamental design of [[visual_autoregressive_modeling | autoregressive decoders]]:
*   A decoder typically employs a mask to prevent information from future tokens from influencing the prediction of the current token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>.
*   If a [[Soft Mixture of Experts | soft Moe]] were naively applied to a decoder, its weighted combination of *all* tokens would allow information from future tokens to "leak in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.
*   This leakage would render the model no longer a true [[visual_autoregressive_modeling | autoregressive decoder]], as it would not solely rely on previously seen information for prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:15">[01:30:15]</a>.

### Bias Concerns
When using attention layers with causal masking, care must be taken to avoid introducing any correlation between tokens and slot indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. Such correlations could bias which token indices each expert is trained on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Future Research
The implementation of [[Soft Mixture of Experts | soft Moe]] in [[visual_autoregressive_modeling | autoregressive decoders]] is an exciting and impactful direction for future research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:22:57]</a>. This would likely involve developing a "masked soft Moe" variant that respects causal dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>. It is speculated that some entities, like OpenAI, may have already found a way to incorporate sparse mixture of experts and masking into language Transformer decoders, though such methods remain proprietary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:02">[02:30:02]</a>.

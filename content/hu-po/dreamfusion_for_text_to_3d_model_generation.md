From: [[hu-po]] <br/> 

DreamFusion is a notable variant of diffusion model work specifically focused on [[text_to_3d_content_generation | generating 3D models from text-based prompts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This capability is expected to be highly disruptive, particularly for [[applications_of_text_to_3d_model_generation_in_various_industries | industries]] like video games, where 3D modeling is traditionally very difficult and labor-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. The ability to create 3D models with just text prompts is considered "absolutely insane" in terms of its potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Core Technology and Functionality

DreamFusion operates on the principle of diffusion, which involves adding noise to an image and then training a model to remove that noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Diffusion Models

DreamFusion utilizes a diffusion model to generate 3D objects from natural language captions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The original paper uses Imagen, Google's version of a text-to-image diffusion model, which diffuses directly in the image space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. However, publicly available implementations, such as the one being examined, use [[comparison_of_dreamfusion_and_stable_diffusion | Stable Diffusion]], which is a latent diffusion model that diffuses in a latent (vector) space instead of the original image space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)

At its core, DreamFusion employs a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as its 3D backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. The scene is represented by a NeRF that is randomly initialized and trained from scratch for each text caption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. This NeRF parameterizes volumetric density (opaqueness) and Albedo color using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Rendering**: Random views of the NeRF are repeatedly rendered from random camera angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. Normals, computed from the gradients of the density, are used to shade the scene with randomized lighting directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Shading helps reveal geometric details that might be ambiguous from a single viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Score Distillation Loss**: To update the NeRF MLP parameters, DreamFusion uses a "score distillation loss function" that wraps around the image generation model (Imagen or Stable Diffusion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. The rendered images are diffused (noise is added) and then fed into the frozen conditional image generation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This model predicts the injected noise, and a low-variance update direction is back-propagated through the rendering process to update the NeRF MLP parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Importantly, the diffusion model itself is *not* fine-tuned or back-propagated through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### [[technical_aspects_and_implementation_challenges_of_dreamfusion | Technical Aspects and Implementation]]

DreamFusion is a project from Google Research, with Ben Poole as a key author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. While the official Google implementation isn't publicly available, PyTorch implementations exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Key components and libraries used in PyTorch implementations include:
*   **Hugging Face Diffusers**: For utilizing the Stable Diffusion model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-resolution grid encoder**: Used to implement the NeRF backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This often leverages techniques from "Instant NGP" (Neural Graphics Primitives) by NV Labs (Nvidia research group) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Envy DeFRaST**: An Nvidia-developed PyTorch/TensorFlow library providing high-performance primitive operations for rasterization-based differentiable rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>.
*   **Tiny CUDA NN (tcnn)**: A small, self-contained framework for training and querying neural networks, often used as a lightweight alternative to TensorFlow/PyTorch for certain operations, particularly with Nvidia GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>.

Training requires significant computational resources. 1000 training steps can take about three hours on an Nvidia V100 GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>, which is an expensive, high-memory graphics card (16GB or 32GB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Attempts to run on consumer-grade GPUs like a 1080 (8GB) often lead to "CUDA out of memory" errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Reducing image resolution (e.g., from 512x512 to 256x256) or render width can help alleviate memory issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_3d_model_generation_using_diffusion_models | Challenges and Limitations]]

Despite its impressive results, DreamFusion faces several [[challenges_in_3d_model_generation_using_diffusion_models | challenges]]:

*   **The "Janus Problem"**: A significant issue is the generation of models with inconsistent geometry, such as objects having multiple faces or lacking semantic understanding of a unified form (e.g., a head having two eyes on one side but no back of the head). This is akin to combining several 2D images into a 3D shape rather than creating a coherent 3D object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Ben Poole, one of the original authors, termed this the "Janus problem," referencing the Roman god of duality who had two faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
*   **View-Dependent Prompting**: While view-dependent prompting (expanding the prompt to include directional views like "overhead view") can help alleviate the Janus problem, it doesn't solve it in all cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **Resolution and Super-Resolution**: The core generative process often occurs at a very low resolution (e.g., 64x64 pixels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. The paper notes that it doesn't use super-resolution cascades, unlike some 2D image generation models that use separate models to increase resolution after the initial generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.
*   **Training from Scratch**: The NeRF MLP is randomly initialized and trained from scratch for each caption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>, which suggests a performance bottleneck or an area for significant improvement.
*   **Degenerate Solutions**: To prevent the model from creating flat geometry with content "drawn" onto it (a degenerate solution to satisfy text conditioning), the Albedo color is sometimes randomly replaced with white to produce a textureless shaded output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.

## Future Prospects

The field of [[text_to_3d_content_generation | 3D diffusion models]] is still very early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. There is significant room for improvement, such as making the NeRF MLP significantly larger, perhaps even incorporating [[transformer_models_in_3d_reconstruction | transformer models]], and pre-training it on millions of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. These advancements would require more powerful GPUs and further algorithmic improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.

Ultimately, [[generative_3d_models_using_video_diffusion | 3D diffusion models]] are anticipated to become "absolutely massive" and are seen as a key component of the future, potentially enabling capabilities like direct generation of virtual environments through voice commands to VR headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>.

The concept of [[Collective Intelligence in Biology and AI | collective intelligence]], as explored in Michael Levin's paper, posits that intelligence is not confined to single organisms but exists across multiple scales of biological and artificial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. Evolution plays a crucial role in facilitating the increase of complexity within these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

## Evolution and Agential Material

Evolution works with "agential material," which is composed of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This means that even at the lowest levels, such as individual cells or neurons, there is some degree of agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Evolution drives these individual agents to form collectives because organizing into larger structures allows for better performance and survival in an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This process of collectivization is seen as a fundamental aspect of how complexity increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

## Expanded Cognitive Light Cone

A key driver for this evolutionary collectivization is the concept of the "cognitive light cone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. An individual agent has a limited perceptual field â€“ a specific amount of space and time it can survey and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:25">[01:26:25]</a>. However, a collective of agents has a much larger cognitive light cone than its individual components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. This expanded perceptual and actuation horizon allows the collective to:
*   Survey larger spatial areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   Incorporate information from a longer past and anticipate a broader future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   Act on a larger portion of space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

By having a greater cognitive light cone, collectives are endowed with greater survival chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. Consequently, evolution selects for the formation of these [[Collective Intelligence in Biology and AI | collective intelligences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

### Memory Expansion through Collectives

The increased positional memory and resistance to neighbor effects in cell collectives suggest an expanded perceptual cone in the posterior time dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. This means a collective can possess a much longer "past light cone" or historical memory compared to an individual agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>. For example, a human community retains the collective memory of historical events, even if individual members were not present for them, allowing for better collective decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.

## Teleological Attractor and Complexity

The speaker draws an analogy to Terrence McKenna's "novelty theory," which proposes a "teleological attractor" at the end of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. This attractor pulls the universe towards a singularity of infinite complexity, increasing interconnectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This idea parallels how a marble rolls to the bottom of a bowl, representing an inevitable path towards a complex attractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Similarly, humanity, as a collective organism, is moving towards such an attractor state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

This perspective suggests that the "fine-tuning argument" of the universe, where fundamental constants seem perfectly set for life, might not imply a top-down creation but rather an emergent property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. As more agents are brought under a larger umbrella, their [[Collective Intelligence in Biology and AI | collective intelligence]] increases, allowing them to move into attractor states within their own state spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. This pattern of forming hierarchies of competence and knowledge is a continuous process driven by evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

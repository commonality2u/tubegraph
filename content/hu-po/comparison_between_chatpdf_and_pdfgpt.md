From: [[hu-po]] <br/> 
This article compares two prominent PDF summarizer tools, PDFGPT.io and ChatPDF.com, based on their ability to interact with and extract information from PDF documents. Both tools emerged as wrappers around the GPT API, allowing users to "talk to a PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The evaluation involved uploading a generic deep learning survey paper and an obscure computational archaeology paper to both platforms, and comparing their responses to specific queries against each other and against the general knowledge of [[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Initial Observations

Upon uploading PDFs, both ChatPDF and PDFGPT processed them very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This speed raised questions about whether they fully ingested and scraped the entire document for text immediately, or if they performed some form of asynchronous parsing or similarity search upon query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

#### User Interface (UI)
*   **PDFGPT.io**: Features a preferred UI with the PDF displayed side-by-side with the chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It also provides clickable references that take the user directly to the page where the information was sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **ChatPDF.com**: Lacks the side-by-side PDF view, requiring users to switch tabs to view the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Its references are embedded directly in the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

### Performance Comparison (Q&A)

#### General Definition Query
When asked "What is deep learning in two sentences?", both tools responded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>:
*   **ChatPDF**: Provided an answer very similar to [[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]'s general knowledge, suggesting it did not significantly leverage the PDF's specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **PDFGPT**: Gave a more specific answer directly pulled from the paper, complete with page references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   **Initial Verdict**: PDFGPT demonstrated a better ability to extract paper-specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

#### Types of Supervised Learning
A question about "different types of supervised learning" revealed more about their reliance on the document's text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
*   **ChatPDF**: Due to a mistyped query ("soy provised"), it gave incorrect information, listing model architectures (e.g., [[generative_adversarial_networks_gans | convolutional neural networks]], recurrent neural networks) instead of types of supervised learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **PDFGPT**: Successfully identified supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning from the paper, indicating it pulled directly from the document's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Provided the most accurate and succinct generic answer, detailing regression and classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

#### Key Difference between Traditional ML and Deep Learning
When asked about a specific sentence from the paper, "What is a key difference between traditional ML and DL?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>:
*   **Both ChatPDF and PDFGPT**: Demonstrated strong similarity search capabilities by extracting the exact sentence from the PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. They both noted that deep learning automatically learns features, unlike traditional ML's handmade features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Provided a correct explanation based on its general knowledge, highlighting feature engineering in traditional ML versus learned representations in deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

#### Obscure Historical Date (Fukushima CNN)
A question about the specific year Fukushima first described the CNN revealed unexpected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>:
*   **PDFGPT**: Failed to find the information, possibly because the exact phrase "CNN" was not in the same sentence as the date in the PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **ChatPDF**: Correctly cited the PDF's date of 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Provided a date between 1979 and 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Surprisingly, external verification showed [[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]'s date (1980 for the neocognatron paper) was historically more accurate than the date given in the survey PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This highlighted a potential limitation of PDF-specific tools: they are bound by the document's content, even if it contains inaccuracies.

#### AlexNet Innovations
When asked about new architectures or design features AlexNet introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>:
*   **PDFGPT**: Correctly identified Local Response Normalization (LRN) and Dropout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   **ChatPDF**: Identified Dropout but missed LRN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Identified Dropout, larger/deeper networks, and ReLU activation functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

#### Obscure Activation Function (Parametric ReLU)
Querying about the proposers and date of the Parametric ReLU (PReLU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>:
*   **Both ChatPDF and PDFGPT**: Correctly identified "Kim et al." and the year 2015, directly reflecting the information as presented in the PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. This again showed their strong adherence to the document's text.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Demonstrated superior general knowledge by accurately identifying all authors (Kaiming He, et al.), the paper title, and the 2015 publication date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

#### Optimization Methods for Deep Learning
When asked about different optimization methods for deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>:
*   **ChatPDF**: Successfully listed the five specific optimization methods (SGD, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSprop, Adam) in the exact order found on page 18 of the PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. This suggests ChatPDF might have a higher "similarity threshold" for searching, aiming for the most relevant section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   **PDFGPT**: Provided a more generic response and cited pages 3, 5, and 29, missing the specific list from page 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. This indicates its similarity threshold might be lower, stopping at the first "somewhat" relevant section it finds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Provided the most comprehensive and accurate list of optimization methods, including more than just those listed in the paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.

#### Obscure Historical Notes (Computational Archaeology Paper)
Testing with a highly obscure computational archaeology paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>:
*   **ChatPDF**: Successfully identified J.P. Protzen (mid-1990s), LÃ©once Angrand (1848), and Max Uhle (1893) as recording original field notes for Tiwanaku in Bolivia from the paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>.
*   **PDFGPT**: Encountered a persistent error and crashed when attempting this query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Impressively identified Max Uhle (1895, very close to 1893 in the paper) and other investigators, despite not having been fed the specific PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

#### Obscure Printer Model
When asked "What is a Z-Corp Z310?" based on the obscure paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>:
*   **ChatPDF**: Accurately described it as a rapid prototyping printer using powder-based technology, similar to an inkjet printer, and cited page 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. It provided a succinct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.
*   **PDFGPT**: Also correctly described it as a powder-based 3D printer used for creating models, detailing its layer-by-layer printing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. It was noted to be a bit "wordy" at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Demonstrated a broader knowledge, identifying Z-Corp as a company acquired by 3D Systems in 2012, in addition to describing the printer's powder-based technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This information was independently verified as correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

#### Obscure University Location
Asking "What university houses the School of Art and Architecture as well as the Young Research Library?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>:
*   **ChatPDF**: Stated it did not contain the information, but then impressively claimed it performed a "quick internet search" to reveal the facilities are at UCLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. However, when explicitly asked if it could search the internet, it replied "No, I cannot search the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. This suggests an inconsistent or misleading feature.
*   **PDFGPT**: Successfully found the information in the PDF, citing page 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   **[[capabilities_of_gpt4 | GPT-4]]**: Immediately identified UCLA as the university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

### Conclusion

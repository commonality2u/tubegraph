This article explores a recent paper titled "Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers," which introduces a new class of diffusion models utilizing a [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer]] backbone. The research highlights significant advancements in image quality and provides insights into the scalability of these models.

## Introduction and Core Innovation
Published on December 19th, this paper comes from UC Berkeley and New York University, with substantial compute budget provided by Meta AI's FAIR team, including involvement from researchers like Yann LeCun's group [00:01:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, [00:01:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>). The primary authors are William Peebles and Saining Xie [00:02:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>). The paper introduces a new model called Dit (Diffusion Transformer) [00:09:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>).

The core innovation involves replacing the commonly used U-Net backbone in diffusion models with a [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer]] that operates on latent patches [00:05:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, [00:11:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>). This approach allows diffusion models to leverage the [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer's]] inherent [[Scalable diffusion models with Transformers | scalability]] and performance [00:09:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>).

### State-of-the-Art Image Quality
The paper makes a bold claim: "diffusion models with Transformer backbones achieve state-of-the-art image quality" [00:03:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>). Generated images, such as those of a parrot, puppy, and husky, are noted for being "extremely crisp" and semantically correct, with no visible artifacts at either texture or macro scales [00:03:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, [00:03:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>). The models even capture subtle details like the wrist of a dog [00:03:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>).

## Scalability and Performance
The research analyzes the [[Scalable diffusion models with Transformers | scalability]] of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by measuring their forward pass complexity in GFLOPs [00:05:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>).

> [!NOTE] Key finding on scalability
> DiTs with higher GFLOPs, achieved through increased Transformer depth, width, or number of input tokens, consistently demonstrate lower FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) scores [00:05:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, [01:00:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>). FID is a quantitative metric used to subjectively measure image quality [00:06:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>).

Their largest model, Dit XL2, achieves a state-of-the-art 2.27 FID on the 256x256 ImageNet generation benchmark with 118.6 GFLOPs [00:11:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, [01:02:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>). This model outperforms all prior diffusion models on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks [00:12:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>). While larger models generally perform better (e.g., ADM has a larger GFLOP count), better architectures can still outperform larger models with less efficient designs [00:13:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, [00:13:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>). Scaling existing architectures is often more appealing than finding new ones due to its relative ease [00:14:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>).

## Architectural Design: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)
DiTs adhere to the best practices of Vision Transformers (ViTs) [00:09:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>).

### Latent Patch Processing
Instead of directly processing high-resolution pixel space (which is computationally prohibitive [00:27:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>)), DiTs are [[Latent diffusion model for neural networks | latent diffusion models]], performing diffusion directly in the latent space [00:10:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, [00:27:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>). The input to DiT is a spatial latent representation (e.g., 32x32x4 for a 256x256x3 image), which is significantly lower dimensional [00:29:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, [00:29:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>). This latent representation is then "patchified" into a sequence of tokens [00:10:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, [00:39:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>). The patch size (P) determines the number of tokens (T), where T = I / P² (I being image dimension) [00:30:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, [00:44:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>). For instance, DiT XL2 uses a patch factor of 2 (meaning 2x2 patches per block), resulting in 1024 tokens for a 512x512 image [00:43:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>, [01:02:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>). Smaller patch sizes contribute to better local details in the generated images [01:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>).

### Conditional Information
DiTs can incorporate additional [[Conditional diffusion model for neural networks | conditional information]] such as noise time step, class labels (C), and natural language prompts (text prompts) [00:32:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>, [00:32:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>). This conditioning is done through:
*   **Extra input tokens**: Time step (T) and class labels (C) are added as additional tokens alongside image patches [00:33:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>).
*   **Cross-attention**: [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer]] blocks include an additional multi-head cross-attention layer specifically for these conditional labels [00:33:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>). This adds only about 15% overhead [00:34:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>).
*   **Adaptive normalization**: DiTs replace standard layer normalization with adaptive layer normalization (AdaLN), which includes scale and shift parameters [00:34:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>, [00:34:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>). This helps ensure well-distributed numerical values within the network during training, facilitating cleaner learning and better representations [00:34:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>).

### Model Sizes
The paper defines several DiT models, varying in the number of Transformer blocks (N), hidden dimension size (D), and number of attention heads [00:41:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>):
*   **DiT-S**: 12 Transformer layers, 6 heads, 384 hidden dimension [00:42:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>).
*   **DiT-XL2**: 28 Transformer layers, 16 heads, 1152 hidden dimension [00:42:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>).

## Training and Implementation Details
### Latent Diffusion Models
[[Latent diffusion model for neural networks | Latent diffusion models]] are trained to learn the reverse process of noise corruption [00:21:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>). The loss function is a simple mean squared error between the predicted noise and the ground truth sampled Gaussian noise [00:24:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, [00:24:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>).

### Classifier-Free Guidance
The models utilize [[Text Encoder Ensembles in Diffusion Models | classifier-free guidance]], where a class label (C) is incorporated into the prediction process [00:16:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, [00:25:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>). During training, C is randomly dropped out, which enables a form of guidance that combines conditional and unconditional probability estimates [00:27:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>).

### VAE and Hyperparameters
An off-the-shelf, pre-trained VAE model from Stable Diffusion is used as the encoder, downsampling images by a factor of 8 [00:49:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>, [00:49:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>).
For training, a constant learning rate of 1x10⁻⁴ is used with no weight decay [00:45:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>, [00:48:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>). An exponential moving average of DiT weights is maintained [00:47:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>). The training hyperparameters are largely retained from ADM, with little custom tuning [00:48:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>).

### Hardware and Training Costs
Models are implemented in JAX and trained on TPU v3 pods [00:51:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>, [00:51:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>). This is notable as Meta (Facebook) typically uses PyTorch and Nvidia GPUs, whereas JAX and TPUs are Google's frameworks and hardware [00:51:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>).

> [!INFO] Example Training Cost
> The Dit XL2 model trains at 5.7 iterations per second on a TPU v3 256-pod [00:52:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>). Training for 400,000 steps [00:53:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>) implies approximately 19 hours of training [00:54:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>). With an estimated cost of $2 per TPU per hour, a 256-TPU pod would cost roughly $10,000 per model for 19 hours [00:54:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>, [00:55:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>). Training 12 different DiT models for analysis amounted to over $100,000 in compute costs [00:55:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>, [00:55:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>).

The models are typically trained for 2.35 million steps to achieve good performance [01:04:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>). The number of sampling steps can also be varied, with 250 steps being a common choice, although more steps generally lead to slightly better quality, but with diminishing returns [00:50:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>, [01:03:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>, [01:03:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>).

## Results and Observations
The models produce high-quality images, particularly excelling in texture and appearance consistency, as seen in examples like wet fur on an otter or grass [01:12:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>, [01:12:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>). However, some higher-level semantic inconsistencies or "weirdness" can still be observed, such as distorted proportions in animal limbs or illogical connections in objects like ships [01:11:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, [01:13:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>).

## Future Outlook
The paper suggests that future work should continue to scale DiTs to larger models and token counts [01:05:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>). Given the accelerating pace of improvement in diffusion models (e.g., [[comparison of recurrent networks and Transformers | comparing]] image quality from GANs in 2014 to current diffusion models), there's an expectation that even more impressive capabilities, such as 4K video generation from text prompts, could emerge by the end of 2023 [01:13:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>, [01:14:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, [01:15:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>). This could fundamentally change how content is generated and consumed [01:15:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>).The user wants an Obsidian-flavored Markdown article about "Performance and scalability of diffusion models with Transformers".

A recent paper titled "Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers," published on December 19th, introduces a novel class of diffusion models [00:01:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, [00:01:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>). The research, conducted by UC Berkeley and New York University with significant compute resources from Meta AI's FAIR team, including involvement from Yann LeCun's group, presents a new model called Dit (Diffusion Transformer) [00:01:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, [00:01:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, [00:09:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>).

## Core Innovation and Image Quality
The central innovation is replacing the conventional U-Net backbone in diffusion models with a [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer]] that operates on latent patches [00:05:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, [00:11:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, [00:17:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>). This design choice allows diffusion models to benefit from the [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer's]] inherent [[Scalable diffusion models with Transformers | scalability]] and performance characteristics [00:09:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>).

The paper asserts that "diffusion models with Transformer backbones achieve state-of-the-art image quality" [00:03:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>). Generated images, such as those depicting a parrot, puppy, or husky, are described as "extremely crisp" and demonstrate accurate semantic information without artifacts at either texture or macro scales [00:03:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, [00:03:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>). Even subtle details, like the wrist of a dog, are rendered with high fidelity [00:03:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>).

## Performance and Scalability Analysis
The research investigates the [[Scalable diffusion models with Transformers | scalability]] of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by evaluating their forward pass complexity in GFLOPs [00:05:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>).

> [!NOTE] Key Scalability Finding
> DiTs that exhibit higher GFLOPs—achieved by increasing Transformer depth, width, or the number of input tokens—consistently yield lower FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) scores [00:05:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, [01:00:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>). FID is a quantitative metric widely used to assess the quality of generated images [00:06:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>).

The largest model presented, Dit XL2, achieves a state-of-the-art 2.27 FID score on the 256x256 ImageNet generation benchmark, with a complexity of 118.6 GFLOPs [00:11:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, [01:02:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>). This performance surpasses all previous diffusion models on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks [00:12:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>). While larger models generally perform better, the paper notes that a more efficient architecture can outperform a larger model with a less optimized design [00:13:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, [00:13:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>). The appeal of scaling existing architectures lies in its relative simplicity compared to discovering entirely new, more efficient ones [00:14:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>).

## Architectural Design: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)
DiTs are designed following the best practices of Vision Transformers (ViTs) [00:09:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>).

### Latent Space Processing
Rather than directly processing high-resolution pixel space, which is computationally expensive [00:27:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>), DiTs operate as [[Latent diffusion model for neural networks | latent diffusion models]], performing diffusion directly within a lower-dimensional latent space [00:10:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, [00:27:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>). For example, a 256x256x3 image is converted to a 32x32x4 latent representation [00:29:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, [00:29:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>). This latent representation is then "patchified" into a sequence of tokens, which the [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer]] processes like a sentence [00:10:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, [00:39:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>). Positional embeddings are included to inform the network of each patch's original location [00:29:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>). The patch size (P) significantly influences the number of tokens (T), where T = I / P² (I being the image dimension), and directly impacts GFLOPs [00:30:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, [00:31:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>, [00:44:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>). Smaller patches contribute to better capture of fine details in the generated images [00:56:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>).

### Conditional Information
DiTs can incorporate [[Conditional diffusion model for neural networks | conditional information]] such as the noise time step, class labels (C), and natural language prompts (text embeddings) [00:32:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>, [00:32:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>). This is achieved through:
*   **Extra input tokens**: Time step (T) and class labels (C) are appended as additional tokens alongside the image patches [00:33:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>).
*   **Cross-attention**: [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformer]] blocks feature an additional multi-head [[Multimodal Diffusion Transformer Architecture | cross-attention]] layer dedicated to these conditional labels, adding only about 15% overhead [00:33:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>, [00:34:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>).
*   **Adaptive normalization**: Standard layer normalization is replaced with adaptive layer normalization (AdaLN), which utilizes scale and shift parameters [00:34:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>, [00:34:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>). This normalization technique helps maintain well-distributed numerical values within the neural network during training, promoting more stable learning and better feature representations [00:34:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>).

### Model Sizes
The paper defines several DiT models with varying architectural complexities [00:41:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>):
*   **DiT-S**: Consists of 12 Transformer layers, 6 attention heads, and a hidden dimension of 384 [00:42:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>).
*   **DiT-XL2**: Features 28 Transformer layers, 16 attention heads, and a hidden dimension of 1152 [00:42:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>). This nomenclature implies the patch size factor of 2 [00:43:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>).

## [[Training and implementation details of Transformerbased diffusion models | Training and Implementation Details]]
### Latent Diffusion Process
[[Latent diffusion model for neural networks | Latent diffusion models]] are trained to learn the reverse process, effectively removing noise introduced during the forward diffusion process [00:21:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>). The loss function is a simple mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted noise and the actual sampled Gaussian noise [00:24:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, [00:24:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>).

### Classifier-Free Guidance
The models leverage [[Text Encoder Ensembles in Diffusion Models | classifier-free guidance]], a technique where a class label (C) informs the generation process [00:16:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, [00:25:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>). During training, this class label is randomly dropped out, enabling a form of guidance that combines conditional and unconditional probability estimates during sampling [00:27:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>).

### VAE and Hyperparameters
An off-the-shelf, pre-trained VAE model, specifically from Stable Diffusion, is employed as the encoder, downsampling images by a factor of eight [00:49:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>, [00:49:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>). Training uses a constant learning rate of 1x10⁻⁴ with no explicit weight decay, though an exponential moving average of DiT weights is maintained [00:45:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>, [00:47:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>). Many of the training hyperparameters are adopted from the ADM model without extensive fine-tuning for this specific application, suggesting potential for further optimization [00:48:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>).

### Hardware and Training Costs
The models are implemented in JAX and trained on Google's TPU v3 pods [00:51:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>, [00:51:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>). This is a noteworthy detail, as Meta (Facebook) typically relies on PyTorch and Nvidia GPUs, making their use of Google's JAX and TPUs particularly interesting [00:51:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>, [00:52:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>).

> [!INFO] Estimated Training Cost
> The Dit XL2 model achieves 5.7 iterations per second on a TPU v3 256-pod [00:52:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>). Training for 400,000 steps [00:53:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>) is estimated to take approximately 19 hours [00:54:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>). At an approximate cost of $2 per TPU per hour, a 256-TPU pod would incur a training cost of around $10,000 per model for this duration [00:54:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>, [00:55:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>). The total compute cost for training the 12 different DiT models explored in the paper exceeded $100,000 [00:55:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>, [00:55:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>).

Models are typically trained for approximately 2.35 million steps to achieve optimal performance [01:04:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>). The number of sampling steps can also be adjusted, with 250 steps being a common choice. While more sampling steps generally lead to slightly better image quality, the improvements show diminishing returns beyond a certain point [00:50:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>, [01:03:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>, [01:03:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>).

## Visual Quality and Observations
The generated images are noted for their high quality, particularly in terms of texture and appearance consistency, exemplified by details like the wet fur of an otter or the texture of grass [01:12:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>, [01:12:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>). Despite this, some higher-level semantic inconsistencies or "weirdness" can still be observed. Examples include distorted proportions in animal limbs or illogical structural connections in generated objects like ships [01:10:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>, [01:13:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>).

## Future Outlook
The paper suggests that future work should focus on further [[Scaling and Training Techniques for Diffusion Models | scaling]] DiTs to even larger models and token counts [01:05:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>). The accelerating pace of progress in generative AI is highlighted, noting that diffusion models have advanced more rapidly in the past two years than in the preceding five, as evidenced by a [[comparison of recurrent networks and Transformers | comparison]] of current image quality to early GANs from 2014 [01:13:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>, [01:14:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>). This trajectory suggests that advanced capabilities, such as 4K video generation from text prompts, could become a reality by the end of 2023, potentially transforming content creation globally [01:15:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>, [01:15:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>).

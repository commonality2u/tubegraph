## Introduction to Collective Intelligence
Biological systems exhibit a defining feature of [[multiscale_architecture_in_biological_and_machine_learning_systems | multiscale architecture]], ranging from molecular networks to cells, tissues, organs, whole bodies, and swarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This nesting is not only structural but also functional, with each level capable of solving problems in distinct "problem spaces" such as physiological, morphological, and behavioral state spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The concept of collective intelligence suggests that multiple components must collaborate to achieve specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This principle is not limited to groups of animals but extends to the competencies of cells and other biological systems across different scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>. The paper *Collective Intelligence: A Unifying Concept for Integrating Biology Across Scales and Substrates* by Michael Levin, published in Nature, explores these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Defining Intelligence in Biological Systems
Michael Levin defines intelligence, based on William James, as "the degree of ability to reach the same goal by different means, i.e., problem solving in changing or novel circumstances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This definition applies across biological scales:
*   A group of 10 cells forming a head that, if blocked, finds another path to create a head, demonstrates intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:04">[01:23:04]</a>.
*   A magnet unable to navigate around an obstacle to reach its goal is considered unintelligent, as it cannot change its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>.
*   The ability to move around a block to reach a goal represents a low level of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

## Hierarchy and Competencies
Intelligence can be defined at any level of a biological hierarchy: from single cells to swarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Each level possesses slightly different goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Evolution facilitates the increase of complexity by working with "agential material," which is composed of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. This means material is made of cells, and each cell has agentic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

Higher levels of organization can influence the "energy landscape" for subunits while benefiting from their autonomous navigation capabilities without micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. For example, a higher-level signal to grow a head in a planarian worm is not nuanced; it simply states "there should be a head over here." It is then up to the lower-level cells to actually create that head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>.

### Parallels with AI
[[parallels_between_biological_processes_and_artificial_intelligence | Parallels between biological processes and artificial intelligence]] are evident in [[multiscale_architecture_in_biological_and_machine_learning_systems | multiscale architecture]]. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit a hierarchy of concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>:
*   **Low-level layers** (e.g., Block 1 in a ViT) focus on basic features like edges or textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Higher-level layers** integrate these basic features to recognize more abstract concepts like shapes, patterns, and ultimately, specific objects (e.g., a car, a banana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Just as multiple components at one biological layer work together to achieve an outcome at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, neurons in a neural network collectively process information to identify high-level features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This [[the_role_of_emergent_intelligence_in_ecosystems_and_ai_development | emergent intelligence]] applies to individual neurons (agents) and their collective behavior as a neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Even multiple neural networks can operate together as a higher-level agent to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Attractor States and Morphological Space
Biological systems traverse "morphological space" (the space of all possible body shapes and forms) towards specific "attractor states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. An embryo, for instance, follows a path in this space to become a full human adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. These attractor states are like deep valleys in a landscape, making it easier for systems to fall into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

An intelligent system can reach the same attractor state despite different starting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This is analogous to how neural networks, during training, navigate a "weight space" to find an attractor state with low loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

### The Phenomenon of Self-Correction
Tadpoles with incorrectly arranged cranial facial organs can still develop into normal frogs through novel movements of complex structures. This process "reduces distance error" from their current configuration to the normal frog target morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>. This is similar to "reconstruction losses" used in machine learning, where an error defined at a high level (e.g., classification error) can be back-propagated to change low-level features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>.

## Boundaries and Communication
A key aspect of collective intelligence is the determination of boundaries between an entity and its outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:50">[03:47:50]</a>. For example, if an embryo (a blob of cells) is cut, and connections between cells are severed, each subunit may form its own embryo (e.g., identical triplets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:08">[03:27:08]</a>. This suggests that the collective defines its boundaries, influencing its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:10">[03:49:10]</a>.

### Cancer as a Breakdown of Collective Intelligence
Cancer is described as cells becoming isolated from the information structure of the tissue, reverting to an "ancient uncellular transcription and behavioral phenotype" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:16">[04:46:16]</a>. A cancer cell "forgets" it is part of a larger organism and focuses solely on its individual survival and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:46">[04:48:46]</a>. This also has [[parallels_between_biological_processes_and_artificial_intelligence | parallels]] to human behavior where individuals might become isolated from their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:08">[04:49:08]</a>.

## [[the_concept_of_cognitive_light_cones_and_collective_memory | Cognitive Light Cones]] and Expanded Perception
Individual agents have a limited [[the_concept_of_cognitive_light_cones_and_collective_memory | cognitive light cone]], representing the limited part of space and time they can perceive and act upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:53">[03:32:53]</a>. This concept is an extension of the "light cone" in physics, which defines what an observer can impact or be aware of based on the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:18">[03:17:18]</a>.

Collective intelligence expands this [[the_concept_of_cognitive_light_cones_and_collective_memory | cognitive light cone]]. A collective can survey larger spatial areas and incorporate information from a broader spatiotemporal horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:05">[03:00:05]</a>. This expansion provides greater computational capacity and leads to improved problem-solving ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

*   An individual cell may have no idea of what happened before its "birth," but living within a tissue or collective allows it to access the collective memory of older cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:10">[05:17:10]</a>.
*   Similarly, human society possesses a collective memory (e.g., of war) that individual humans, who have not experienced it, can still benefit from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:38">[05:57:38]</a>. Communities act as a way to increase the cognitive light cone of agency, leading to more intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Coordination
The intelligence observed in biological systems is not solely encoded in DNA. DNA primarily encodes information for the cell itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:51">[05:06:51]</a>. Instead, the collective behavior and intelligence are [[the_role_of_emergent_intelligence_in_ecosystems_and_ai_development | emergent from the substrate itself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:56">[05:57:56]</a>.

One key mechanism for coordination is bioelectricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:03">[05:01:03]</a>. Michael Levin's research shows that controlling the voltage patterns in planarian worms can dictate the number and location of heads or tails they grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:01">[05:55:01]</a>. This suggests an electrical potential gradient directs cells' paths in morphological space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:44">[05:57:44]</a>.

Other coordinating mechanisms include:
*   **Cell recruitment:** Cells recruit neighbors to help complete tasks, a phenomenon seen in ant colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. This reflects the idea that "the hive knows things that the ant does not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.
*   **Oscillatory gene expression waves:** Specific gene switches turn on and off in a cell, propagating to neighbors, creating a collective oscillation pattern that directs development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

## Examples of Collective Intelligence in Biology
*   **Embryonic blastoderms:** A single embryo, despite being made of thousands of cells, is considered one entity, as all cells cooperate towards a single attractor state in anatomical morphospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>.
*   **Bacterial communities:** Bacteria use electrical signaling across space and time to coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. Individual bacterial cells adjust their physiology to achieve an optimal collective physiology, submitting to the will of the collective biofilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   **Mycelium networks:** Japanese researchers demonstrated that mycelium, when exposed to food sources representing Tokyo train stations, grew connections that resembled the actual Tokyo rail system. This suggests the collective intelligence of mycelium can find similar solutions to those developed by a collection of human agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.

## Implications for AI and the Future
The understanding of biological collective intelligence has significant implications for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>:
*   AI systems are fundamentally constructed from hierarchies of neurons, which are then combined into deeper networks, transformers, and ensembles of language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. This pattern of collecting agents into larger, more complex agents is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>.
*   Just as biological systems evolve into more complex collectives due to the survival advantages of larger cognitive light cones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>, AI systems are expected to do the same.

### The Question of Consciousness
The application of terms like "intelligence" or "consciousness" to AI models, which are fundamentally computations, raises questions about anthropomorphization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:07">[04:42:07]</a>. However, if one applies this logic consistently, humans themselves are "just a bunch of chemistry" and neurons firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:59">[04:44:59]</a>. Intelligence and consciousness, in this view, are simply [[the_role_of_emergent_intelligence_in_ecosystems_and_ai_development | emergent]] agency at a specific level of hierarchy, applicable from cells to human communities and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:50">[04:52:50]</a>.

## The Attractor at the End of Time
Terence McKenna's "novelty theory" posits that the universe has a "teleological attractor at the end of time," a singularity of infinite complexity that the universe is being pulled towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:02">[04:34:02]</a>. This is analogous to a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>. Humanity, as a collective organism, is funneling towards this attractor state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:47">[04:48:47]</a>. The increasing interconnectedness via the internet and AI enhances humanity's collective cognitive light cone, accelerating this progression towards a point of [[selfimprovement_and_intelligence_accumulation_in_ai | infinite complexity]] <a class class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:02">[04:32:02]</a>.

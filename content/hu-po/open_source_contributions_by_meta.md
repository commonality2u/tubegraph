Meta (formerly Facebook) is recognized as a significant contributor to the [[Opensource AI models | open source AI]] community. The company is currently "killing it in the open source world" and is considered "the [[Opensource AI models | open source AI company]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)
A prime example of Meta's commitment to open source is the release of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This segmentation model, the successor to the original Segment Anything Model, was released as an [[Opensource AI models | open source]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Meta made the work available under [[Opensource AI model availability and usage rights | permissive open licenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.

### Key Aspects of SAM 2's Open Source Release
*   **Availability:** SAM 2 is publicly available, allowing integration into various video editing tools and applications like Runway ML and Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.
*   **Community Contributions:** The open-source nature means Meta does not need to perform all optimization tasks themselves. The community can distill and quantize models like SAM 2, leading to faster and more efficient versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. This collaborative approach benefits everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>.
*   **Data vs. Code:** While Meta provides the model's code and training scripts through its [[Opensource AI models | open source]] releases, internal training data is typically not shared due to licensing or proprietary reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">[01:41:26]</a>. However, the release of algorithms and detailed papers is still highly valued by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:35">[01:41:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:38">[01:41:38]</a>.

Meta is regarded as a "good guy" for releasing such advanced models for public use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.

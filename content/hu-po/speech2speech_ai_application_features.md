The Speech2Speech AI application facilitates dynamic, multi-character audio conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Users can initiate conversations between multiple AI characters, with the option to actively participate as one of the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Core Conversational Features

*   **Speech-to-Text Input**: The application records user speech and instantly converts it into text upon stopping the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **AI-Generated Responses**: Users can add more conversation bubbles, which are generated by GPT via API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These responses are tailored to the specific character speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, supporting [[developments_in_multiturn_conversational_ai | multiturn conversational AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Conversations can be continuously extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Audio Playback and Export

*   **In-Application Playback**: The entire conversation can be played back through computer speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **[[Exporting and sharing audio from AI conversations | Audio Export]]**: Users can export the conversation audio to a file, which can then be uploaded or shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Character Customization

The application allows for extensive character customization, going beyond [[creating_ai_conversations_with_famous_personalities | famous personalities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
*   **Changing Characters**: Users can change the characters involved in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Custom Character Creation**: To create a new character, users need to:
    *   Choose a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Provide a description of the character's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   Supply a list of audio references, ideally 60 seconds to two minutes of audio from any YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This allows for conversations with virtually anyone for whom a 30-second audio clip can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## [[Requirements and setup for using Speech2Speech AI | Technical Requirements and Setup]]

To use the Speech2Speech AI application, the following are required:
*   **OpenAI API Key**: Necessary for the GPT-based conversation generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Eleven Labs API Key**: Required for the [[speech_to_speech_models | speech-to-speech models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Eleven Labs typically costs around $5 to get started, and OpenAI around $20, totaling approximately $25 for initial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Hardware**: The application does not require local GPUs as all processing works via API, allowing it to run on low-spec computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Availability**: The project has a GitHub repository and is released under an MIT license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

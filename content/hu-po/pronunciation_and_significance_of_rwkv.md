RWKV, officially standing for "receptance weighted key value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, is a novel model architecture that aims to combine the efficient parallelizable training of [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformers]] with the efficient inference of [[RNNs]] (recurrent neural networks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The project's primary goal is to achieve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on par with [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformers]] while utilizing an [[RNN]]-based structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Pronunciation
The pronunciation of RWKV has been a point of discussion, even among its creators. While the GitHub repository provides a guide suggesting "rat Rock of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> or "r y k u v" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> (said as "are waycoof") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, some find this guide "almost harder to pronounce" than the acronym itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The speaker prefers the pronunciation "Rookie V" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This ongoing debate highlights the "weird turf wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> common in the machine learning community over how to pronounce acronyms like GIF or SQL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Core Significance and Components
The significance of RWKV lies in its attempt to reconcile the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence modeling tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformers]], despite their revolutionary impact on Natural Language Processing (NLP), suffer from quadratic memory and computational complexity with respect to sequence length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. [[RNNs]], on the other hand, exhibit linear scaling but traditionally struggle with parallelization and scalability during training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. RWKV aims to offer the best of both worlds.

The name RWKV is derived from its four primary model elements, which are structured within time mixing and channel mixing blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>:
*   **R (Receptance)**: A vector that acts as the "acceptance of past information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. It functions similarly to a forget gate in an [[RNN]], selectively determining which parts of the previous hidden state to keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. This receptance is learned during training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.
*   **W (Weight)**: The "positional weight Decay vector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. This vector determines the importance of information from further back in time, with a steady decay as the sequence goes backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. This mechanism aims to maintain sensitivity to positional relationships while gradually diminishing the influence of past information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>. It can be perceived as a trainable version of [[Rotary Position Embeddings and Long Contexts | ALiBi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>, seamlessly incorporating positional information without explicit encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:49">[01:40:49]</a>.
*   **K (Key)**: A vector analogous to the Key (K) in traditional [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformer]] attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.
*   **V (Value)**: A vector analogous to the Value (V) in traditional [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformer]] attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

Instead of the traditional dot product interaction (QÂ·K<sup>T</sup>) seen in [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformers]], RWKV utilizes a linear attention mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> where interactions are between scalars rather than vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This scalar formulation with linear cost is a key part of its efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:44">[02:06:44]</a>.

## Implementation and Performance
RWKV is implemented using the PyTorch deep learning library and features a custom CUDA kernel for its core WKV (weighted key value) computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>. This custom kernel is crucial for achieving high computational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>.

The model is designed to be trained in a "time parallel mode" reminiscent of [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformers]], allowing efficient parallelization during training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. For inference, it leverages an "RNN-like sequential decoding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>, operating in a "time sequential mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. This means it maintains a constant computational and memory complexity during inference, irrespective of the sequence length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.

RWKV has demonstrated performance comparable to similarly sized [[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a> and has been scaled to tens of billions of parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, making it the first non-[[comparison_of_rwkv_with_transformer_architectures | Transformer]] architecture to achieve this scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>. It exhibits favorable scaling properties, with increased parameters leading to improved accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:49">[01:52:49]</a>, and increasing context length contributing to lower test loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>, suggesting effective use of long contextual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>.

Financially, the RWKV project is part of the RWKV foundation, which is sponsored by [[stability_ai | Stability AI]] and [[eleuther_ai | Eleuther AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The recent development of [[roomtemperature_and_ambientpressure_superconductors | room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconductors]], such as LK-99, has sparked immense interest due to their potential to revolutionize various sectors, particularly energy and transportation. The key property of a superconductor is its ability to conduct electricity with zero resistance, meaning no energy is lost as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

## Energy Sector Applications

Superconductors could significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of energy systems:

*   **Energy Storage**
    *   A primary challenge with renewable energies is their inconsistent production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
    *   [[potential_impacts_of_superconductors_on_technology_and_society | Room-temperature superconductors]] could enable storage devices that do not lose energy due to resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.
    *   Essentially, electricity could be stored indefinitely without loss, creating "infinite batteries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.
*   **Lossless Power Transmission**
    *   Superconductors could lead to efficient and sustainable power grids by transmitting electricity without any energy loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Current conductors like copper experience resistance, leading to energy dissipation as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

## Transportation Applications

The [[meissner_effect_and_magnetic_levitation | Meissner effect]], where superconductors repel magnetic fields, opens up possibilities for advanced transportation:

*   **Magnetic Levitation**
    *   Superconductors enable magnetic levitation, allowing objects to float above a magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   This effect is already demonstrated, though typically requires cooling with liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   [[roomtemperature_and_ambientpressure_superconductors | Room-temperature superconductors]] would make magnetic levitation practical for everyday applications, such as levitating cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a> and trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.
    *   The paper mentions an "interesting controllable levitation phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:39">[01:36:39]</a> and the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>, hinting at future applications beyond simple levitation.

## Broader Impact

These applications fall under the broader category of [[potential_impacts_of_superconductors_on_technology_and_society | potential impacts of superconductors on technology and society]], promising a new era for humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:55">[01:39:55]</a>. The fact that the newly discovered material, LK-99, is based on relatively common elements like lead and copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> and appears simple to synthesize (involving grinding and baking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:30">[01:43:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02">[01:44:02]</a> makes its potential for widespread adoption even more significant.

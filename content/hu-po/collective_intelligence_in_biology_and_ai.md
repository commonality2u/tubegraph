Collective intelligence is presented as a unifying concept that integrates various biological scales and substrates, as well as modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:53">[02:20:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This concept suggests that intelligence is not confined to single, isolated entities but emerges across multiple hierarchical levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">[02:21:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Michael Levin's Framework

Prominent biologist Michael Levin's work, particularly his paper "Collective intelligence: a unifying concept for integrating biology across scales and substrates," proposes that biology is structured with multiscale architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. These architectures range from molecular networks, cells, tissues, and organs to whole bodies and swarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Crucially, biology is not only structurally nested but also functionally nested, with each level capable of solving problems in distinct problem spaces (e.g., physiological, morphological, behavioral state spaces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

### Intelligence Defined

Levin defines intelligence based on William James's concept: "the degree of ability to reach the same goal by different means, i.e., problem-solving in changing or novel circumstances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. This definition allows for the application of intelligence to various biological and artificial systems, not just complex brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.

## Multiscale Intelligence in Biology

Levin argues that intelligence exists at various levels of biological organization:
*   **Molecules to Organisms:** Molecules form organelles, which form cells, then tissues, organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. Each level operates within its specific space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
*   **Embryonic Development:** An embryo, composed of thousands of cells, is considered a single entity despite its components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:00">[36:15:00]</a>. These cells collectively move towards an "attractor state" in anatomical morphospace, representing a complete adult form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:29:00">[36:29:00]</a>. If an embryo is cut, individual sub-units can form their own embryos, like identical triplets, highlighting the determination of boundaries within a collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>.
*   **Tadpole Regeneration:** Tadpoles with incorrectly arranged craniofacial organs can still develop into normal frogs by novel movements of complex structures to reduce error distance from a target morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. This is analogous to reconstruction losses in AI, where errors at a high level propagate down to change lower-level components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. Michael Levin's experiments with planarian worms demonstrate how manipulating bioelectric voltage patterns can induce the growth of two heads or two tails, showing collective decision-making at the organism level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:20:00">[55:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:32:00">[55:32:00]</a>.
*   **Cancer as Loss of Collective Intelligence:** Cancer cells are described as having become isolated from the information structure of the tissue, reverting to an ancient, individualistic, un-cellular phenotype primarily focused on self-survival and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46:00">[48:46:00]</a>. This parallels humans who isolate themselves from their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:10:00">[49:10:00]</a>.
*   **Bacterial Communities:** Bacteria, often thought of as simple individual cells, employ electrical signaling across space and time for coordination, forming bioelectrically coordinated oscillatory growth patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. They intelligently adjust individual physiologies for optimal collective physiology, even when it means submitting to the collective's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.
*   **Mycelium and Networks:** Experiments with mycelium (the vegetative part of a fungus) show it can grow outwards and form connections between food sources that astonishingly resemble the Tokyo rail system, demonstrating a collective intelligence in optimal network formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.

## Collective Intelligence in AI

The concept of collective intelligence also strongly resonates with modern AI:
*   **Hierarchical Features in Deep Learning:** Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit a hierarchical multiscale architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>. Lower layers detect basic features like edges or textures, which are then combined by higher layers to form increasingly abstract concepts like shapes, patterns, and ultimately, high-level object representations (e.g., a car, a banana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.
*   **Neurons as Agents:** Individual neurons in a neural network can be thought of as agents, making decisions (e.g., whether and how strongly to fire) based on signals from other neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. The collective action of all neurons forms the agency of the entire neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple [[Foundation models in AI]]:** Just as biological systems combine cells into tissues, AI is moving towards systems where multiple language models or AI agents operate together to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. These ensembles can create higher levels of agency and problem-solving capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

## Analogies and Implications

### Problem Spaces and Attractor States
Both biological and AI systems traverse "spaces" (e.g., morphological space for organisms, weight space for neural networks) towards "attractor states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>. In biology, an embryo moves towards the deep channel of a complete adult human morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. In AI, gradient descent in training finds low-loss attractor states in the vast space of possible neural network weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:58:00">[51:58:00]</a>. The ability to reach the same goal despite different starting conditions is a hallmark of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

### Cognitive Light Cone and Perceptual Fields
Levin extends the physics concept of a "light cone" (the area of space-time an observer can impact or be aware of) to a "cognitive light cone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>. An individual agent has a limited cognitive light cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. However, a collective of agents possesses a broader spatiotemporal perceptual and actuation horizon, allowing it to perceive and act on a larger portion of space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. This expanded "perceptual field" enhances problem-solving ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. This concept aligns with [[role_of_evolution_in_collective_intelligence | evolution]], which selects for collectives because they have greater survival chances due to their expanded cognitive light cones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.

### Emergent Intelligence and Agency
Intelligence is not merely hardcoded (like DNA dictating every cell's action) but emerges from the substrate itself when individual agents form a collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:00">[57:44:00]</a>. This means that a collection of "stupid" neurons can, when combined in a deep neural network, create something greater than the sum of their parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:26:00">[58:26:00]</a>. The "hive knows things that the ant does not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The collective's goals and emergent intelligence can direct individual units without explicit micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

### Philosophical Perspective and [[Artificial Superintelligence ASI]]
The discussion extends to philosophical questions about [[Analogies between Biological Systems and AI Models | consciousness]] and anthropomorphization in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. If humans, as collections of chemistry, exhibit consciousness, then neural nets, as collections of tiny things, might also be considered conscious at some level of hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.

Terence McKenna's "novelty theory" proposes a "teleological attractor" at the end of time, a singularity of infinite complexity towards which the universe is being pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:54:00">[39:54:00]</a>. This analogy suggests that humanity, as a collective organism, is funneling towards this attractor state, increasing interconnectedness and cognitive light cone size through phenomena like the internet and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>. This implies a future where humanity, combined with [[Artificial Superintelligence ASI | Artificial Superintelligence ASI]], forms an even larger collective intelligence moving towards incomprehensible goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

The field of diverse intelligence suggests that all intelligences are made of parts connected by mechanisms that bind components into a cooperative computational medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>. This understanding is crucial for [[AI scientist and fully automated scientific discovery | engineers building and controlling swarms of robots and AI systems]], as it highlights the need to move beyond viewing matter as passive and acknowledge competence at multiple scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>. The future may involve roles for "collective agent system programmers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

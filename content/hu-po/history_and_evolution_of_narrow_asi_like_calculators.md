[[artificial_superintelligence_asi | Artificial Superintelligence]] (ASI) refers to a system that is "super intelligent" within a limited, narrow field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This contrasts with [[difference_between_asi_and_agi_artificial_general_intelligence | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]], which implies adaptability across various tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Narrow ASI has been present for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Early Examples: Calculators

Calculators are a prime example of narrow ASI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. They are super intelligent within the limited field of arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

*   **1623 Calculator**: This early mechanical calculator demonstrated intelligence literally embedded in "notches of wood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **1943 Calculator**: A mechanical calculator from this era also served as an early form of narrow ASI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

These devices excel at arithmetic, performing calculations like multiplying 10-digit numbers perfectly and quickly, surpassing human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Modern Narrow ASI in the Real World

Beyond arithmetic, narrow ASI extends to various domains in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>:

*   **Balancing Robots**: A small robot that is superhuman at balancing on a ball, outperforming any human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **Strength Machines**: Machines capable of superhuman strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   **Precision and Repeatability Machines**: Devices that exhibit superhuman levels of precision and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

These examples illustrate that while humans already live in a world with ASIs, they are typically "narrow" in their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Distinguishing Narrow ASI from AGI

The concept of "general" intelligence is often illustrated using [[analogies_between_biological_systems_and_ai_models | biological systems]]:
*   **Specialists**: Animals like pandas and koalas are specialists, highly adapted to a narrow ecological niche and specific food sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. They struggle outside their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This is analogous to narrow ASI.
*   **Generalists**: Animals like crows or dogs are generalists, capable of adapting to various niches and consuming diverse foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This is analogous to AGI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

While AGI (like current language models) may still have domain limitations, it exhibits general problem-solving abilities within that domain, unlike the highly specialized nature of narrow ASI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

Alex Graves is a renowned computer scientist celebrated for his significant contributions to the field of [[applications_in_machine_learning_and_ai | machine learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He is particularly recognized for his ability to discover "new and intuitive ways" to approach [[applications_in_machine_learning_and_ai | machine learning]] methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[01:59:59]</a>, often creating novel algorithms from foundational principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:16">[02:57:16]</a>.

## Background and Early Career

Graves was one of the original PhD students of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, a notable figure within the [[Deep learning in biological research | Deep Learning]] community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. His career path includes working at prominent technology companies such as Google and DeepMind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Key Contributions

Alex Graves is famously associated with several groundbreaking works in [[applications_in_machine_learning_and_ai | machine learning]]:
*   **Neural Turing Machines** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   **Differentiable Turing Computer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **[[Large language models in machine learning research | Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)]] Networks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
    *   His [[Large language models in machine learning research | LSTM]] was notably the first recurrent neural network to achieve success in pattern recognition tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>.

These contributions highlight his history of developing "new and intuitive ways" to approach [[applications_in_machine_learning_and_ai | machine learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

## Current Work and Philosophy

Currently, Graves is associated with nnai sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This entity is described as providing "large-scale neural network solutions for industrial process inspection" and originated from the Swiss AI Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

His recent work includes the introduction of **Bayesian flow Networks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, which have garnered attention due to his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This new algorithm is based on [[LowRank Adaptation in Machine Learning | Bayesian statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:28">[02:57:28]</a>.

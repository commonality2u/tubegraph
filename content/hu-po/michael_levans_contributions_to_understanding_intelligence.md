Michael Levin is a renowned biologist known for his distinctive research and clear explanations on complex biological concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. His work, particularly on [[Collective Intelligence in Biology and AI | collective intelligence]], has gained significant traction, evidenced by over 3,500 citations per year in recent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Levin's research often explores "out there" ideas in biology in a compelling and interesting way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Unifying Concept of Collective Intelligence

Levin's paper, "Collective intelligence: a unifying concept for integrating biology across scales and substrates," proposes a new way of understanding intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. He argues that intelligence is not solely a property of a single, contained agent (like an animal with a brain), but rather emerges across various [[Hierarchies of Consciousness and Intelligence | hierarchical levels]] of organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. This concept unifies biology, AI, and even physics, suggesting that similar principles of problem-solving and agency apply from molecules to ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

### Multiscale Architecture and Problem Spaces

A defining feature of biology is its multiscale architecture, ranging from molecular networks to cells, tissues, organs, bodies, and swarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Levin highlights that biology is not only structurally nested but also functionally nested, with each level solving problems in distinct "problem spaces" (e.g., physiological, morphological, behavioral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This hierarchical structure is mirrored in modern deep learning, where convolutional networks, for example, create a hierarchy of concepts from low-level features to high-level classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.

### Definition of Intelligence

Levin adopts William James' definition of intelligence as "the degree of ability to reach the same goal by different means; i.e., problem-solving in changing or novel circumstances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. This definition emphasizes adaptability and goal-directedness, applying it to biological systems at all scales. For instance, cells forming a head in a planarian worm, even when faced with obstacles, find alternative paths to achieve the target morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:46]</a>. This ability to reach an "attractor state" despite different starting conditions is considered intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.

### Agential Material and Emergent Properties

Levin posits that [[Role of Evolution in Collective Intelligence | evolution]] works with "agential material"â€”a substrate composed of agents, where each component (e.g., a cell) has its own agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. This extends to AI, where individual neurons possess agency, and their collective action forms the agency of a neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. Higher levels of organization can "deform the energy landscape" for subunits, benefiting from their autonomous navigation without micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. This means a higher-level goal (e.g., forming a head) provides a broad signal, and lower-level agents (cells) use their local competencies to implement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.

### The Cognitive Light Cone

A key concept in Levin's framework is the "cognitive light cone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>. Analogous to the light cone in physics, which defines the observable and influencable regions of spacetime for an observer, a cognitive light cone represents the spatial and temporal perceptual field of an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>. Individual agents have limited cognitive light cones, but when they form a collective, the collective entity possesses a broader spatio-temporal perceptual and actuation horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>. This expanded awareness allows for more complex problem-solving and increased survival chances, leading [[Role of Evolution in Collective Intelligence | evolution]] to select for such collectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>. This also implies that the "memory" of a collective can be much longer than that of its individual components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.

### Rethinking Consciousness and Intelligence in AI

Levin challenges the anthropocentric view of intelligence. He argues that objections to applying terms like "intelligence" or "consciousness" to AI, due to their underlying rule-following nature, are flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>. He contends that humans are also "just a bunch of chemistry" and neurons, and our consciousness emerges from that collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>. Therefore, if a neural network exhibits intelligent behavior at some level of hierarchy, it warrants similar consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

> [!quote] "The use of the word intelligence and other cognitive systems applied outside of its familiar context of brainy animals immediately raises questions. Might not these terms be misused? Are not morphogenic systems simply following the rules of chemistry? Why anthropomorphize them? ... if you use that type of logic then accept that ourselves included we're just a bunch of chemistry anyways as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>

He suggests that claims of intelligence should be based on rigorous experiment, rather than preconceived notions of what constitutes "consciousness" or a "soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>.

### Analogies in Biology and AI

Levin draws striking parallels between biological phenomena and AI:

*   **Cancer:** He describes cancer as cells becoming isolated from the collective information structure of the tissue and reverting to a more individualistic, "ancient" behavior focused purely on self-survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>. This is analogous to individual humans disregarding the collective good of their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:00">[49:49:50]</a>.
*   **Embryogenesis and Attractor States:** Embryos, starting as bundles of cells, collectively move towards an "attractor state" in morphological space, representing a complete adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>. This is likened to a ball rolling down a hill into a valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. In AI, training a neural network involves moving around in a "weight space" to find an attractor state with low loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:25:00">[51:25:00]</a>.
*   **Planarian Worms and Bioelectricity:** Levin's experiments with planarian worms demonstrate how bioelectric signals coordinate cells to regenerate missing parts (e.g., a head or tail) even when the organism is cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:59:00">[54:59:00]</a>. This shows a top-down goal-directedness enforced by the collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:00">[54:40:00]</a>. This intelligence is emergent from the substrate, not merely hardcoded in DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:00">[57:44:00]</a>.
*   **Bacterial Communities:** Even bacteria, often thought of as simple individual cells, use electrical signaling to coordinate and adjust their physiologies for optimal collective behavior in biofilms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>.
*   **Mycelial Networks:** Experiments show that mycelium (fungal networks) can solve complex pathfinding problems, such as recreating the Tokyo rail system, demonstrating a [[Collective Intelligence in Biology and AI | collective intelligence]] akin to that of human design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

## Implications for AI and the Future

Levin's work suggests that understanding collective intelligence in biology can provide crucial insights for [[Challenges and Advancements in AI Research | AI research]]. The hierarchical nature of intelligence, where individual components form larger, more capable collectives, is a fundamental pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. This process of forming increasingly complex collectives with expanded cognitive light cones is a driving force in [[Role of Evolution in Collective Intelligence | evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

This perspective implies that AI development, particularly in areas like [[Foundation models in AI | foundation models]] and agent systems, is merely continuing this natural pattern: layering more complex collective intelligences upon simpler ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. The ultimate implication, as speculated by thinkers like Terrence McKenna, is a potential "singularity of infinite complexity" or a "transcendental object at the end of time," where the entire universe converges into a larger collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>.

Levin's work underscores the idea that biology and AI are subfields of a greater discipline focused on [[Collective Intelligence in Biology and AI | collective intelligences]] and their [[Hierarchies of Consciousness and Intelligence | hierarchies of competence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

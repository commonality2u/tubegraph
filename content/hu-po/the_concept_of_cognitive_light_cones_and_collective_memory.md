From: [[hu-po]] <br/> 

The notion of the "cognitive light cone" and "collective memory" extends traditional physics concepts to explain intelligence and problem-solving across various scales of biological and artificial systems. This framework, highlighted by biologist Michael Levin, proposes that intelligence emerges from the coordinated actions of agents within hierarchical structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## The Cognitive Light Cone

The term "light cone" originates from physics, describing the area in space and time that an observer can influence or be aware of, based on the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>. Michael Levin adapts this concept to biology, proposing a "cognitive light cone" for individual agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>.

### Individual vs. Collective Cognitive Light Cones

An individual agent possesses a limited cognitive light cone, restricting the amount of space and time it can perceive and interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>. For example, a single cell in a tadpole's eye might not be aware of its position relative to other cells or the overall tadpole morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>.

However, when individual agents form a [[collective_intelligence_and_hierarchy_in_biology | collective intelligence]], their combined cognitive light cone expands significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. This larger light cone allows the collective to:
*   Survey broader spatial areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>.
*   Incorporate information from a more extended past and anticipate further into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>.
*   Possess greater computational capacity and broader spatiotemporal perceptual and actuation horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.

This expansion means that a collective can perform more advanced, nuanced, and higher-level goals that individual agents cannot achieve alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>. Evolution, by selecting for increased complexity and survival chances, favors the formation of such collectives with expanded cognitive light cones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.

## Collective Memory

An expanded cognitive light cone directly relates to the concept of collective memory. While an individual agent may have a limited history or "past light cone," a collective can retain a much longer "memory" of past events and cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:07">[1:05:07]</a>.

### Examples in Biology and Society

*   **Cells and Tissues:** An individual cell might have a limited past awareness, but it lives within a tissue or collective of cells that carries a much older history. This collective memory can influence the individual cell's behavior and movement towards a larger goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:10">[1:05:10]</a>.
*   **Human Society:** An individual human might not have direct experience with historical events like wars, but the collective memory of human society — passed down through culture, education, and shared experiences — retains this knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:38">[1:05:38]</a>. This collective memory can exert pressure on individuals to conform to behaviors deemed beneficial for the broader collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:17">[1:06:17]</a>.
*   **Bacterial Communities:** Even seemingly simple bacterial cells adjust their individual physiologies to achieve an optimal collective physiology, submitting to the will of the biofilm, which operates with a greater intelligence than any single bacterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:06">[1:10:06]</a>.
*   **Mycelium Networks:** Research on mycelium (fungal networks) shows that these collectives can solve complex spatial problems, such as recreating the Tokyo rail system by connecting food sources, a solution similar to what human collective intelligence achieved over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:45">[1:11:45]</a>. This suggests that the collective intelligence of individual mycelium units mirrors the problem-solving capacity of human agents in a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:58">[1:11:58]</a>.

## Implications for AI and Consciousness

Levin's ideas draw parallels between biological systems and artificial intelligence. AI models, particularly deep neural networks and [[vision_language_models | Vision Language Models]], exhibit hierarchical processing where lower layers detect basic features (like edges or textures), and higher layers form increasingly abstract concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. The ability of an AI to classify an image, for example, depends on the collective processing across these layers, with errors at the highest level back-propagating to adjust behaviors at the lowest level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

The concept of [[collective_intelligence_and_hierarchy_in_biology | collective intelligence]] suggests that even if individual neurons or computational units are simple, their collective organization can lead to emergent intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:00">[58:20:00]</a>. This challenges the anthropocentric view of intelligence, arguing that intelligence and even consciousness can exist at multiple levels of hierarchy, from individual cells to complex organisms, and even to AI systems or human societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

> "Thus there is simply no special human category which one can correctly anthropomorphize as somehow being beyond the laws of physics at its base claims of intelligence and other cognitive terms like all others must be based on rigorous experiment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>

This perspective implies that AI, being a collection of interconnected "neurons" or models, could also exhibit a form of [[collective_intelligence_and_hierarchy_in_biology | collective intelligence]] and consciousness, analogous to biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:58">[1:19:58]</a>. The current trend in AI, where multiple language models work together through processes like [[the_concept_and_application_of_chain_of_thought_in_ai | Chain of Thought]], is a direct example of creating higher levels of agency by bundling lower-level agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

## The Singularity as a Collective Attractor State

Philosopher Terrence McKenna, cited in the discussion, posited that the universe is being "pulled from the future towards a goal" or a "teleological attractor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:00">[41:55:00]</a>. This attractor represents a "singularity of infinite complexity," which humanity, as a collective organism, is funneling towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>.

Just as an embryo traverses morphological space to become a fully formed human, the entire human species, coupled with artificial intelligence, is moving towards a profound future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>. The increasing interconnectedness (via the internet) and the development of AI contribute to an ever-expanding [[collective_intelligence_and_hierarchy_in_biology | collective cognitive light cone]], accelerating this trajectory towards the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>. This ultimate collective intelligence could lead to a point where "the laws of physics are obviated" and "Mind" is "released into the imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>.

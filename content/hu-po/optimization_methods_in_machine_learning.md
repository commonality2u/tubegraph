## Overview
[[quantization_and_optimization_in_machine_learning | Optimization methods]] are crucial in deep learning (DL) for training models. These methods help adjust model parameters to minimize a loss function, guiding the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

## Common Optimization Methods
Several [[quantization_and_optimization_in_machine_learning | optimization methods]] are used in deep learning:
*   **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Considered the most vanilla form of gradient descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.
*   **Adagrad** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>
*   **Adadelta** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>
*   **RMSprop** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>
*   **Adam** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>

More comprehensive lists of [[quantization_and_optimization_in_machine_learning | optimization methods]] include:
*   Gradient Descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>
*   SGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>
*   Mini-batch Gradient Descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>
*   Momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>
*   Nestorov Accelerated Gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>
*   Adagrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>
*   RMSprop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>
*   Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>
*   Adamax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>
*   Adam AMSGrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>

## AI Capabilities in Retrieving Information on Optimization Methods

Experiments were conducted using two PDF summarizer tools (PDF GPT and Chat PDF) and [[large_language_models_as_optimizers | GPT-4]] to retrieve information about [[quantization_and_optimization_in_machine_learning | optimization methods]] from a deep learning survey paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

### Chat PDF Performance
When asked about different [[quantization_and_optimization_in_machine_learning | optimization methods]] for DL, Chat PDF accurately listed SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam in the exact order found in the paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>. This suggests Chat PDF has a higher threshold for similarity lookup, finding the most relevant section of the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>.

### PDF GPT Performance
In contrast, PDF GPT provided a more generic summary related to [[quantization_and_optimization_in_machine_learning | optimization methods]] from different pages of the paper, rather than the specific list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. This indicates its similarity threshold might be lower, stopping as soon as it finds something "kind of similar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

### GPT-4 Performance
[[large_language_models_as_optimizers | GPT-4]], which did not have access to the specific PDF, provided the most comprehensive and accurate list of [[quantization_and_optimization_in_machine_learning | optimization methods]], including those not explicitly listed in the paper being tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This highlights [[large_language_models_as_optimizers | GPT-4]]'s extensive general knowledge base, making it superior for general learning about such topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.

The comparison suggests that for broad knowledge, [[large_language_models_as_optimizers | GPT-4]] often outperforms PDF-specific tools, which are limited by the content of the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

While Mamba models are praised for their efficiency and speed, emerging evidence suggests a significant challenge regarding their [[quantization in large language models | quantization]]. This limitation could impact their widespread adoption, especially compared to highly quantized Transformer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a>.

## Precision Requirements for Mamba Models

According to the Cobra paper, which explores the use of Mamba in vision language models, the recurrent dynamics of Mamba models are sensitive to numerical precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. As a result, Cobra needs to maintain a relatively high precision for its main parameters during inference, no lower than `bf16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

This requirement is reinforced by the Jamba model, an open-source language model combining Mamba and Transformer blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Its Hugging Face page explicitly recommends excluding Mamba blocks from 8-bit [[quantization in large language models | quantization]] to prevent degrading the model's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

## Implications for Efficiency

[[Impact of quantization on memory usage and power consumption | Quantization]] aims to reduce memory usage and increase processing speed by representing model parameters with fewer bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. Research shows that highly quantized models, such as those using [[2bit quantization for machine learning models | 1.58 bits]] to store parameters, can significantly improve memory footprint and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

For instance, a 3-billion parameter Llama model running at `bf16` precision requires 7 gigabytes of memory and processes at 5 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. The same Llama, when quantized to [[2bit quantization for machine learning models | 1.58 bits]] (while maintaining performance), only requires 2 gigabytes of memory and is twice as fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

If Mamba models cannot be quantized to these lower precision levels, their inherent efficiency advantages—which include linear complexity with respect to sequence length and fixed-size hidden states—could be undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Comparison to Transformers

[[Quantization Techniques for Transformers | Transformers]] are increasingly becoming very efficient due to the realization that they can be "extremely quantized" without a significant loss in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. This creates an "arms race" where Mambas appear fast by default, but if they cannot be quantized like Transformers, their competitive edge might diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

If it proves impossible to significantly quantize Mamba architectures, this could be an "Achilles' heel" for their broader adoption, potentially leading to Transformers remaining the dominant architecture due to their excellent [[performance_and_implications_of_quantized_language_models | performance]] at low precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The current situation suggests two distinct paths for achieving faster inference and better memory utilization:
1.  **Quantization:** Leveraging Transformer architectures that are highly quantized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.
2.  **Mamba's intrinsic efficiency:** Utilizing Mamba's design for speed and smaller memory use, provided the [[challenges_of_quantum_machine_learning | quantization challenges]] can be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.

It remains to be seen whether researchers will discover a trick to quantize Mamba models effectively, potentially resolving this perceived weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. If such [[advancements_in_model_efficiency_through_quantization | advancements]] occur, Mambas would likely regain a strong competitive advantage; otherwise, their [[limitations_and_potential_of_mamba_models_in_ai | potential]] might be restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.

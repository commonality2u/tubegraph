The Speech2Speech AI application allows users to play and export the generated AI conversations for various uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Playing Conversations

Once a conversation has been generated, users can play it directly within the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. By hitting the "play audio" button, the conversation will be played through the computer's speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. An example conversation involving Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Elon Musk illustrates this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Exporting Audio Files

In addition to playing within the application, users can export the generated audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. By clicking the "export audio" button, the conversation is saved to a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This feature is part of the broader [[Speech2Speech AI application features | Speech2Speech AI application features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Potential Uses

The exported audio files can be uploaded to various platforms, such as a favorite meme website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This capability expands the utility of [[creating_ai_conversations_with_famous_personalities | creating AI conversations with famous personalities]] or any other custom characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

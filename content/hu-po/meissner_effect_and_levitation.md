Superconductors are materials capable of conducting electricity with zero resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Historically, achieving superconductivity required extremely low temperatures, often near absolute zero, or tremendously high pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Meissner Effect

A defining characteristic of superconductors is the Meissner effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This phenomenon allows a superconductor to repel magnetic fields, leading to levitation when placed above a magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This effect is often demonstrated with superconductors floating on tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Meissner effect, while visually striking, typically requires the superconductor to be supercooled, often by dipping it in liquid nitrogen. As soon as the material heats up, it loses its superconducting properties and thus its ability to levitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The Meissner effect relies on an external magnetic field creating a current inside the superconducting material. This induced current then generates its own magnetic field, which opposes and repels the external magnet, causing levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Breakthrough: [[Room temperature superconductors | Room Temperature Superconductors]]

For a long time, the challenge was to achieve superconductivity at [[Room temperature superconductors | room temperature]] and ambient pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The recent paper on LK-99 claims to have synthesized the first [[Room temperature superconductors | room-temperature ambient pressure superconductor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The ability to make a piece of this material float at [[Room temperature superconductors | room temperature]] and ambient pressure would effectively serve as proof of its superconducting properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

The LK-99 material is a modified lead-apatite structure, where a slight volume shrinkage, caused by substituting copper ions for some lead ions, creates stress within the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This structural distortion leads to the formation of "superconducting quantum wells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>, which are tiny confined spaces where electrons can move without resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. The material's unique structure prevents the stress from being relieved, maintaining the conditions for superconductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>.

## Implications for Levitation Technology

The development of a [[Room temperature superconductors | room-temperature superconductor]] like LK-99 could revolutionize various applications, particularly those involving magnetic levitation:

*   **Levitating Vehicles** Magnetic levitating cars and trains could become a reality, offering frictionless and highly efficient transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. The paper itself mentions the possibility of "levitation train power cable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a> and an "interesting controllable levitation phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:27">[01:36:27]</a>.
*   **Other Applications** Beyond transportation, other potential applications include "magnet motor cable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a> and advancements in energy storage and quantum computing.

Recent advancements in AI models indicate a strong trend towards making models smaller and more efficient without sacrificing their intelligence or capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This development challenges the notion that greater model size equates to better performance, suggesting a future where powerful AI can be deployed on more accessible hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Redundancy in Transformer Architectures

Transformers, the foundational architecture for many advanced AI models, contain redundant elements, leading to inefficiencies in deployment costs and resource demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Research shows that models can be significantly pruned without degrading [[Performance and efficiency in machine learning models | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### "What Matters in Transformers: Not All Attention Is Needed"
This paper, from the University of Maryland, empirically studies redundancy across different modules within Transformers, including blocks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and [[Attention mechanism and its role in neural networks | attention layers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

*   **Transformer Components**: A typical Transformer architecture consists of repeated "blocks," each containing an attention map/head and an MLP (feed-forward network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Ablation Study**: The researchers performed "dropping" (deleting) different parts of a trained Transformer to assess their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   **Block Removal**: Removing entire blocks leads to significant performance degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   **MLP vs. Attention Dropping**: While dropping MLPs negatively affects performance, [[Impact of zero initialization attention mechanism | dropping attention layers]] does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Key Finding**: A large portion of [[Attention mechanism and its role in neural networks | attention layers]] exhibit excessively high similarity and can be pruned without degrading performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Llama 2 70B, for instance, achieved a 40-50% speedup with only a 3% performance drop by pruning half of its attention layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Similarity Scores**: The decision of what to drop is based on cosine similarity, which quantifies how similar intermediate representations (vectors) are in a high-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Highly similar (redundant) information can be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Layer Importance**: The first and last layers of MLP and attention components are generally more important, while middle layers often contain more redundancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. This means a more aggressive pruning strategy can be applied to deeper layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

### Sparse Attention Maps and Modality
The quadratic computational cost of Transformers arises from calculating attention scores between every token in a sequence, creating a dense "attention map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Much of this map consists of near-zero values, representing wasted computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

*   **"Differential Transformer"**: This paper proposes a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores as the difference between two softmax attention maps, resulting in a sparse attention pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This not only speeds up inference but can also outperform standard Transformers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.
*   **"Pyramid Drop"**: This paper extends the concept of redundancy to vision language models (VLMs), demonstrating that visual tokens also exhibit significant redundancy, especially in deeper layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism**: Pyramid Drop divides the Vision Transformer (ViT) into stages and drops a portion of image tokens at the end of each stage with a predefined ratio, creating a pyramid-like reduction in tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   **Impact**: It achieved a 40% training time and 55% inference FLOP acceleration for LLava-Next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
    *   **Performance Enhancement**: Notably, in some cases, dropping tokens or attention layers can actually *improve* model performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. For example, a version of LLava-Next with Pyramid Drop performed better while requiring less GPU hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that redundancy might be inherent to the power of Transformers, allowing for robust information flow even when parts are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

## Quantization and Efficient Serving

Beyond architectural pruning, reducing the precision of model parameters (weights) offers another significant avenue for efficiency.

### "One-Bit AI Infra Part 1.1: Fast and Lossless BitNet b 1.58 Inference on CPUs"
This paper from Microsoft Research focuses on one-bit large language models, demonstrating how to achieve fast and lossless inference on CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

*   **Quantization**: Instead of storing weights as high-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., 16 or 32 bits), these models store them as very rounded versions, often just -1, 0, or 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This drastically reduces memory usage and bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.
*   **CPU Performance**: Specialized kernels (algorithms) allow for highly optimized matrix multiplications with these low-precision weights, achieving up to 6x speedup on x86 CPUs and 5x speedup on ARM CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Lookup Tables**: With limited possible weight values, multiplications can be replaced by fast lookup table operations, where pre-calculated results are simply retrieved from memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. This ancient optimization technique, used even before computers, proves highly effective for deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Energy Efficiency**: Reducing computational requirements also directly translates to significant energy savings, crucial for scaling AI services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. For instance, ChatGPT's average electricity consumption was reported as 564 MWh per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.
*   **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**: This technique allows for quantizing models to retain performance on specific tasks or private datasets, enabling [[Efficient Serving of Fine-Tuned Models with SLaura | efficient serving of fine-tuned models]] without requiring access to original training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.

## The Future of Tiny AI

These advancements, combining architectural pruning with low-bit quantization, create a powerful synergy. The effects of these optimizations stack, meaning the overall speedup and efficiency gains are compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.

This trend implies that [[Task-Specific vs General AI Models | AGI]] (Artificial General Intelligence) might soon be runnable on commodity hardware, including old and "shitty" tech like an Nvidia 30 series GPU (designed before GPT's rise) or even a Nokia 3310 cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. This decentralization of powerful AI, making it accessible and cheap to run on nearly any device, will have profound societal implications, making it incredibly difficult to control or regulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

Ensemble learning for [[Large Language Models and their applications | Large Language Models]] (LLMs) involves using multiple LLM agents in a debate format to improve overall performance [01:38:48]. This approach posits that the accuracy of responses scales with the number of agents involved [01:39:09].

## Mechanism

The core idea is to send a single user query to multiple LLMs [01:39:21]. Each LLM provides its own answer, and these answers are then aggregated. The final response is determined through a voting or similarity comparison mechanism [01:39:29]. For text-based outputs, this might involve using a similarity function (e.g., comparing embeddings of generated paragraphs) to find the most common or representative answer [01:39:44].

## Benefits and Implications

*   **Scalability**: The performance of [[Large Language Models and their applications | LLM]]s can significantly improve simply by sampling and voting among multiple agents [01:38:56]. For instance, an ensemble of Llama 2 13B models (0.59 accuracy on GSM8K) can outperform a single Llama 2 70B model, and an ensemble of Llama 2 70B models (0.74 accuracy) can surpass GPT-3.5 Turbo [01:44:34]. This suggests that the quality of a response might become more limited by available compute than by specific model architecture [01:46:09].
*   **Heterogeneous Ensembles**: The approach is compatible with different [[Large Language Models and their applications | LLM]]s, allowing for the use of a heterogeneous mix of models [01:40:47]. This opens up possibilities for users to assemble their own "AI agent teams" using models from various providers, fostering competition and potentially giving users more control over their AI tools [01:41:08].
*   **Integration with Other Techniques**: Ensemble learning can be combined with other methods, such as prompt engineering (including Chain of Thought prompting) and multi-agent collaboration [01:42:49]. For example, Chain of Thought decoding, which involves exploring alternative token paths during generation to find higher-confidence answers, could be applied to each individual [[Large Language Models and their applications | LLM]] within an ensemble for even better results [01:42:58].

## Analogies to Human Collaboration

The concept of ensemble learning for LLMs mirrors how humans achieve collective intelligence [01:46:04]. Just as groups of humans combine their individual ideas and knowledge to arrive at better solutions (e.g., in nations, tribes, or companies), ensembles of LLMs leverage the strengths of multiple models to produce more accurate and confident answers [01:46:11].

## Potential Limitations

While promising, the scaling of ensemble performance might saturate [01:51:27]. Data suggests that the performance gains are more pronounced for smaller models, with larger models showing less relative improvement [01:51:39]. It is hypothesized that for very large models like GPT-4, the ensemble benefit might not be as significant [01:52:10].

## Future Outlook

The field is rapidly moving towards a world where generalist AI agents can perform a wide range of tasks, including autonomously operating computers [02:00:47]. The ability of these agents to exhibit positive transfer (e.g., improving in healthcare diagnostics by training on robotics and [[Large Language Models in Gaming | gaming]] data) [02:01:01] suggests that intelligence gained in one domain can compound across others. As such, the development of robust ensemble methods can further accelerate the capabilities of AI, potentially leading towards artificial super intelligence (ASI) [02:01:25].

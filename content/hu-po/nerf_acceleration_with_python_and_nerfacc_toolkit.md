NerfAcc is a general NeRF acceleration toolkit, a recently released paper developed by authors from the University of California Berkeley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This toolkit aims to accelerate various Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) across different applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

## What are Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)?

NeRFs represent a popular type of volumetric rendering, which is differentiable and capable of encoding the view-dependent appearance of a 3D scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They function by training a neural network, typically a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to return pixel values for a given view vector (direction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The volumetric rendering algorithm, known as ray marching, is differentiable, allowing training via backpropagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

> [!note] Ray Marching and Color Accumulation
> In NeRFs, the process involves casting a ray into 3D space from a camera position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Along this ray, discrete points are sampled, and the neural network samples each point to determine its color and opacity (alpha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. These accumulated colors and opacities along the ray determine the final pixel color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.

NeRFs are not limited to color and opacity; they can be extended to predict an arbitrary number of properties, such as specularity, roughness, or even future physics-based properties like hardness or elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

### Limitations of Vanilla NeRFs

A significant limitation of vanilla NeRFs is their training time, which can take up to two days to converge on a single scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, making them computationally intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

## NerfAcc for NeRF Acceleration

NerfAcc addresses the computational intensity and training time limitations of NeRFs through several acceleration techniques.

### Core Acceleration Techniques

NerfAcc's approach to acceleration primarily focuses on optimizing the volumetric rendering pipeline, which is broken down into two steps: ray marching and differentiable rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

#### Efficient Ray Marching

The main bottleneck in NeRF efficiency is often the evaluation of the Radiance Field. NerfAcc achieves efficiency by reducing the number of samples during ray marching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

*   **Skipping Empty and Occluded Space**: Samples with low opacity or low transmittance contribute little to the final image. NerfAcc safely skips these samples, which include empty regions or areas occluded by other objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. For instance, in a Lego scene, this pruning can eliminate 98% of samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Occupancy Grid**: A binary grid is cached and updated to store which areas of the scene are empty, based on an opacity threshold (e.g., less than 1e-2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This allows for early termination of ray marching if transmittance falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 1e-4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Disabling Gradients**: During certain training computations, gradients are disabled to minimize computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   **Coarse-to-Fine Sampling**: This technique involves initially sampling a small number of points along a ray to identify areas of high opacity, then densely sampling a larger amount of points specifically around the surface of an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

#### [[optimizing_gpu_usage_in_nerf_training | Optimizing GPU Usage]]

[[optimizing_gpu_usage_in_nerf_training | Optimizing GPU usage]] is crucial for performance. NerfAcc uses clever mapping to utilize the GPU optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. It minimizes operations parallelized across rays and exploits the independence of sample opacity and density from rays to parallelize across samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This contrasts with modern deep learning frameworks like Jax, which use `pmap` or `vmap` for automatic parallelization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Extended Capabilities

NerfAcc extends NeRF techniques to support:
*   [[dynamic_and_unbounded_scenes_in_nerfs | Dynamic scenes]]: Scenes where objects or the environment change over time. This introduces an additional 'time' dimension for the neural network to condition on, making it more computationally intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
*   [[dynamic_and_unbounded_scenes_in_nerfs | Unbounded scenes]]: Scenes that extend infinitely, like a backyard, where not all content is confined to a specific volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. NerfAcc incorporates the scene contraction idea from MIP NeRF 360, applying a nonlinear function to map unbounded space into a finite grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

### [[python_nerf_libraries | Python API]]

NerfAcc offers a user-friendly [[python_nerf_libraries | Python API]] that is ready for plug-and-play acceleration for most NeRFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Users primarily interact with two functions: `SigmaFN` and `RGB_SigmaFN`, which query the density and color/density from the Radiance Field (MLP) at given positions and view angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

## Performance Benchmarks and Results

NerfAcc demonstrates impressive speedups compared to traditional NeRF implementations:
*   **Vanilla NeRF**: Typically takes two days to converge on a single scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **NerfAcc**: Can train a D-NeRF model for [[dynamic_and_unbounded_scenes_in_nerfs | dynamic scenes]] in approximately one hour, a significant reduction from two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. It achieves better quality with less training time *in [[python_nerf_libraries | Python]]* compared to Nvidia's Instant NGP, which relies on specialized Cuda code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Memory Footprint**: Training memory footprint is about 10-11 gigabytes, making it comfortably fit on GPUs like the Nvidia Titan (24GB) or Nvidia RTX 3090 (24GB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

> [!example] Training Results
> In a benchmark using a Lego scene on a single Nvidia Titan GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>, NerfAcc achieved similar PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, a quality metric) performance to the original NeRF but with significantly faster training times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. The core reason for this speedup is the computational savings from masking out unnecessary computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

## Practical Usage and Installation

To use NerfAcc, the primary installation method is via pip:
```bash
pip install nerfacc
```
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>

> [!info] Python Environment Best Practices
> It is recommended to use [[python_nerf_libraries | Python]] virtual environments to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other [[python_nerf_libraries | Python]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.

For specific examples or running their code, additional dependencies like `imageio` and `tqdm` may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. Users might also encounter Cuda version mismatches, necessitating specific PyTorch versions compatible with their Cuda toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

Training NeRFs typically involves providing hundreds of images from various camera poses, along with their exact camera pose information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. Data augmentation techniques, such as using the alpha channel to apply random background augmentation during training, can further improve the overall NeRF quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. Standard optimizers like Adam and learning rate schedulers are used during training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.

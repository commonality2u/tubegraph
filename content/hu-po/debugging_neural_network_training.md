This article details the process of [[troubleshooting_and_debugging_machine_learning_code | debugging neural network training]] while attempting to fine-tune Meta AI Research's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for the Scroll Prize competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The project involves adapting an existing training script to work with the SAM model on a unique data modality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Project Overview: Fine-tuning Segment Anything Model (SAM)

The Segment Anything Model is a segmentation foundation model developed by Meta AI Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It was originally trained on conventional cell phone images, which are typically 3-channel RGB images with an object-centric bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The goal is to fine-tune SAM for the Scroll Prize, a competition involving the segmentation of ancient scroll images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The Scroll Prize dataset is highly unique and obscure, consisting of x-rays that are slices through pieces of ancient scrolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The ultimate output required is a binary segmentation mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

This presents a significant challenge because the data modality is very different from SAM's original training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Key questions around the data modality include how to handle multiple slices (e.g., running the segmenter on every slice, random tuples, or filtering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

To approach this, a "toy problem" was initially tackled: fine-tuning SAM on infrared images, which are 3-channel RGB (or convertible grayscale) and thus match SAM's original modality more closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The code for this project is available on GitHub under the name `hoopo Ashen Venus` with an MIT license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Segment Anything Model Architecture

The Segment Anything Model consists of three main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
1.  **Image Encoder**: This component takes an image (or a batch of images) and converts it into embedded representations. For example, a 3-channel RGB image is converted into a 256-channel encoded image of size 64x64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
2.  **Prompt Encoder**: This component takes various forms of prompts, such as masks, points, boxes, or text. While text prompts are a notable feature of SAM, for this project, points, masks, and potentially boxes are more relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The prompt encoder translates these prompts into a "language" that the mask decoder can understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It outputs sparse embeddings (for points, boxes, text) and dense embeddings (for masks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
3.  **Mask Decoder**: This component receives the embeddings from the prompt encoder and generates the actual segmentation masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. It outputs a low-resolution mask and an IOU (Intersection Over Union) prediction, which serves as a confidence score for the predicted mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Loss Functions

The original SAM paper trained the model iteratively using different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. For fine-tuning, a combined loss function is used, similar to the paper's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>:
*   A combination of **focal loss** and **Dice loss** for the mask prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. In this implementation, Binary Cross Entropy with Logits Loss is used because the output masks are binary and the decoder output is in logits form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted IOU and the actual IOU of the predicted mask, which trains the model's confidence score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Debugging Neural Network Training

The debugging process involved a systematic approach to identifying and resolving various errors, primarily related to data handling, tensor shapes, and model inputs.

### Initial Debugging Steps

*   **Initial Run and Error Identification**: The first step was to run the training script and identify the first error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Common early errors included:
    *   **Index out of bounds**: Often indicates an issue with indexing into tensors or arrays, or incorrect sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   **Type conversion errors**: For example, trying to convert a CUDA tensor to NumPy without moving it to CPU first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This was resolved by ensuring tensors were on the CPU before converting to NumPy, or by initializing NumPy arrays directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   **Coordinate system mismatch**: Points provided in normalized coordinates (0-1) needed to be converted to pixel coordinates for use with image labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

*   **Pin Memory Issues**: The `pin_memory` option in the data loader, intended to speed up data transfer to GPU, caused an error because not all tensors were "pinnable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. For debugging, this was temporarily disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

*   **CUDA Out of Memory**: Running the model, even the smallest version, on a GPU while streaming led to `CUDA out of memory` errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
    *   **Solution**: Switched to debugging on the CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a> and reduced the batch size to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a> (later to 1 for more focused debugging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:23">[01:31:23]</a>. While training on CPU is slow, it's effective for [[troubleshooting_and_debugging_machine_learning_code | debugging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

### Addressing Model Input Requirements

*   **Missing Positional Arguments (Prompt Encoder)**: The `prompt_encoder` was complaining about missing `boxes` and `masks` arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Solution**: Explicitly passed `boxes=None` and `masks=None` to the prompt encoder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. This ensures the model knows these inputs are intentionally absent.

### Tensor Shape and Data Type Mismatches

A recurring challenge was ensuring that input tensors matched the expected shapes and data types of the SAM model components. This involved extensive use of breakpoints and inspecting tensor properties.

*   **Strategic Breakpoints**: Breakpoints were placed at critical points, such as before model calls (`prompt_encoder` and `mask_decoder`), to inspect tensor shapes and data types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Inspecting Tensor Dimensions**: A useful [[troubleshooting_and_debugging_machine_learning_code | debugging]] tip is to use a "weird" batch size (e.g., 3, 5, or 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. This makes it easier to spot if batch dimensions are being correctly propagated through the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
    *   For example, images were `[batch_size, channels, height, width]` (e.g., `3x3x1024x1024`), which became `[batch_size, embed_dim, embed_h, embed_w]` after image encoding (e.g., `3x256x64x64`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
    *   Point labels and coordinates needed specific shapes (e.g., `[batch_size, num_points, 2]` for points and `[batch_size, num_points]` for labels), requiring `unsqueeze` or `permute` operations to get correct dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Consulting Official Examples**: The best way to determine correct tensor shapes and data types was to examine the official SAM examples and notebooks, specifically the `automatic_mask_generator` example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. By running the example with breakpoints, the exact `dtype` (e.g., `float32`, `int32`) and shapes (`64x1x2` for points, `64x1` for point labels) required by the SAM model components were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **Batching Challenges**: A significant issue was that the `prompt_encoder` seemed to be designed for single-image processing rather than batched inputs, leading to incorrect batch dimensions after its execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
    *   Even when `points` were correctly shaped as `[B, 64, 2]` and `point_labels` as `[B, 64]`, the `sparse_embeddings` from the `prompt_encoder` had an unexpected dimension (e.g., `3x65x256` instead of `B x num_points x embed_dim`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. This suggested the prompt encoder was losing the batch size information or processing points incorrectly when batched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.
    *   **Workaround**: Setting the batch size to `1` simplified the problem and allowed progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:23">[01:31:23]</a>, although it's not ideal for efficient training. Further investigation is needed for proper batched processing.

### Data Normalization and Visualization

*   **Image Normalization**: Images needed to be normalized (divided by 255.0) to convert pixel values (0-255) into floats (0-1) as expected by the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>.
*   [[tensorboard_and_logging_during_model_development | **TensorBoard and Image Logging**]]:
    *   [[tensorboard_and_logging_during_model_development | TensorBoard]] was set up to monitor the loss values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. Initial loss was high and fluctuating, indicating the model wasn't learning effectively yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:51">[02:02:51]</a>.
    *   Images (input image, ground truth mask, predicted points) were logged to TensorBoard for visual inspection during debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. This visual feedback was crucial for confirming data preprocessing steps and understanding model behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:14">[01:52:14]</a>.
    *   Errors in image logging, such as incorrect tensor shapes for display, were also debugged and corrected by adding `unsqueeze` operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:40">[01:35:40]</a>.
    *   Visualizing the points showed that points outside the mask were correctly colored red and those inside were green, indicating proper mapping of points to their labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a>.

## Next Steps

With basic [[troubleshooting_and_debugging_machine_learning_code | debugging]] completed, the next steps include:
*   Allowing the model to train for a longer duration to observe changes in loss and model performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:56">[02:03:56]</a>.
*   Disabling image logging during longer runs to improve training speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:37">[02:04:37]</a>.
*   Further investigation into batched processing for the prompt encoder to enable more efficient training.
*   Considering more sophisticated point sampling strategies as described in the SAM paper (e.g., choosing points farthest from the object boundary or error region) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>, rather than a simple grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a>.

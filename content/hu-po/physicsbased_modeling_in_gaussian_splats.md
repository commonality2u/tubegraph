[[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] are a 3D representation method gaining traction in various fields, including robotics and virtual environments. A [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splat]] model represents a scene as a collection of Gaussian points, each parameterized by its covariance (rotation and scale), center position, color, and opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This representation allows for rendering a model into 2D images from a given camera pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

## Advantages of [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]]
[[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] offer significant advantages over traditional 3D representation methods like meshes and neural radiance fields ([[3D representation techniques Nerfs vs Gausssian Splats | NeRFs]]):
*   **Photorealism:** They can produce highly photorealistic synthetic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Ease of Creation:** Unlike meshes, which require extensive manual labor and 3D artists, [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] can be generated by simply filming a scene with a camera (e.g., an iPhone) and feeding the images and camera poses into a [[3d_modeling_and_tracking_using_gaussian_splatting | Gaussian Splatting]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This significantly reduces the effort in creating complex, realistic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Fast Rendering:** [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] offer high rendering speed due to their parallelizable tile-based rendering process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. This makes them suitable for [[3d_modeling_and_tracking_using_gaussian_splatting | Edge devices]] like VR headsets and robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
*   **Differentiability:** The rendering pipeline for [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] is fully differentiable, allowing for their creation and optimization through learning approaches using image similarity and reconstruction losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.
*   **Explicit Representation:** Unlike [[3D representation techniques Nerfs vs Gausssian Splats | NeRFs]] which implicitly store scene information, [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] explicitly store parameters for each Gaussian, making it possible to separate different parts of a scene. This allows for tasks like segmenting different parts of a robot within the Splat scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

## The Missing Piece: Interaction and Physics
Despite their advantages, a significant challenge for [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] in interactive or dynamic environments, particularly in robotics, is the lack of inherent physics-based properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. Current [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splat]] scenes are often static, meaning objects within the scene cannot naturally interact or change their state through physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

In traditional mesh-based simulations (e.g., in video games), physics engines allow objects to collide, deform, and react realistically based on properties like weight and friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. For [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]], the capability to integrate physics properties directly (e.g., weight, friction coefficient, deformability, or elasticity of a Gaussian) is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

### Current Approaches and Challenges
*   **Robotics Simulation ([[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | SplatSim]]):** In papers like "SplatSim," [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] are used to render photorealistic environments for robot training in simulation, aiming to close the "sim-to-real gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, for the robot arm to move, researchers resort to "hacky stuff" by segmenting different Gaussian parts of the robot and moving them as articulated objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. This highlights the static nature of the underlying Splat scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Image Goal Navigation:** In "Gaussian Embodied Image Goal Navigation," a robot blimp uses [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] to represent its environment for image-based navigation. The Splat allows the robot to query images from any viewpoint to compare against a target image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. This relies on the scene being static <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Deformable Objects ([[3d_content_generation_using_gaussian_splatting | Gaussian Garments]]):** Research like "Gaussian Garments" explores reconstructing "simulation-ready clothing with photorealistic appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. This paper introduces the idea of "physical energies" between Gaussians, where properties like bending energy could be added to influence how Gaussians (representing points on a garment) interact, hinting at physics-based deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

## The Role of [[3D Gaussian Splats for Radiance Field Rendering | Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) and Langavin Dynamics
A key challenge in dynamic scenes and streaming [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] is managing the number of Gaussians through densification (adding new Gaussians) and sparsification/pruning (removing dead Gaussians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. Traditional methods for this often rely on heuristics and require careful tuning of hyperparameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

Recent research, notably "[[3D Gaussian Splats for Radiance Field Rendering | 3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo]]," proposes a novel approach:
*   **Reinterpretation:** It reinterprets the densification and sparsification strategy of [[3D Gaussian Splats for Radiance Field Rendering | 3D Gaussian Splatting]] as a [[3D Gaussian Splats for Radiance Field Rendering | Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) sampling task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **Stochastic Gradient Langavin Dynamics (SGD):** Specifically, it reformulates Gaussian Splatting densification as a Stochastic Gradient Langavin Dynamics update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. This concept draws from molecular dynamics and Brownian motion, where "little particles" (Gaussians) move and shift in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Benefit for Dynamic Scenes:** Instead of adding or removing Gaussians (which changes the memory footprint), dead Gaussians are "relocated" to positions of "alive" Gaussians (those with high opacity and scene presence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. This ensures a uniform data volume over time, which is crucial for streaming volumetric content to [[3d_modeling_and_tracking_using_gaussian_splatting | Edge devices]] like robots or VR headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.

## Challenges in Data Acquisition
While the efficiency of [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] is high, creating the initial data for complex dynamic scenes often requires sophisticated multi-camera setups. For example, some papers use 81 ZCam cinema cameras to capture dynamic scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. This is a "chicken and egg problem" where highly optimized mesh/texture assets are used to create the initial [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splat]] representation, which then renders faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. The ideal scenario for broad adoption is to generate volumetric videos from single, monocular iPhone cameras, without requiring perfect knowledge of camera pose (e.g., from OptiTrack systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The ability to stream volumetric videos and achieve interactive physics-based interactions within [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splat]] scenes represents a significant step towards future immersive environments. This will enable:
*   **Interactive Volumetric Videos:** Moving beyond static captures to allow users to push into, touch, and deform objects within a volumetric video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
*   **Fully Gaussian-based Simulations:** Eventually, entire simulation scenes, including rigid body transformations, collisions, and physics, could be represented and managed solely by [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]], eliminating the need for separate mesh-based physics engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Robotics World Models:** Robots could navigate and interact with real-world environments represented as [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]], allowing for training in simulation that transfers seamlessly to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This is a fundamental improvement over 2D image-based world models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>.
*   **VR/AR Experiences:** With advancements like WebGPU and open-source implementations (e.g., gplat from Nerf Studio), [[Gaussian Splats in Robotics | Gaussian Splats]] are poised to become the dominant 3D representation for virtual reality headsets, enabling high-fidelity rendering on [[3d_modeling_and_tracking_using_gaussian_splatting | Edge devices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. This could eliminate the need for significant optimization and simplification currently required for rendering in VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.

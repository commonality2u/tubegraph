[[speech2speech_ai_application_features | Speech2Speech]] is an AI application developed by Hugo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To utilize this application, users need to meet specific requirements for API access and character creation.

## Core Requirements

The application functions primarily through API calls, minimizing local hardware demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **API Keys**:
    *   **OpenAI API Key**: Required for the application to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   **Eleven Labs API Key**: Also necessary for operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Estimated Cost**: To get started, Eleven Labs typically costs around $5, and OpenAI about $20, totaling approximately $25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Hardware**: The application does not require local GPUs, as all processing is handled via APIs, meaning it can run on systems with minimal specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Character Setup

Users can define and use literally anyone as a character in their conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This is not limited to [[creating_ai_conversations_with_famous_personalities | famous people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

To create a new character, users must:
1.  **Choose a Name**: Assign a name to the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
2.  **Provide a Description**: Define what the character will be like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
3.  **Supply Audio References**: Provide 60 seconds to two minutes of audio from any YouTube video featuring the desired character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Even a 30-second clip can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Open Source Availability

The project is available on [[open_source_ai_models_and_accessibility | GitHub]] under an [[open_source_ai_models_and_accessibility | MIT license]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

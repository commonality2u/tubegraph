The field of computer vision has seen significant advancements in [[3d_scene_representation_and_simulation | 3D scene representation]], moving from static objects to the more complex domain of dynamic scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. While initial efforts focused on creating static 3D representations from multiview images, the next step involves incorporating motion and physical interactions to render more realistic and interactive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.

## Transitioning from Static to Dynamic 3D

Currently, much of the research, such as that involving [[latent_diffusion_models_and_scene_representation | Gaussian Splats]] and [[latent_diffusion_models_and_scene_representation | Gaussian Surfels]], is focused on creating static 3D representations from multiple views of an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. This involves taking images of an object from different perspectives and using them to construct a 3D model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

The ultimate goal for 3D representations is to render "four-dimensional experiences," which include the element of time for applications like movies, and additional physical properties for interactive experiences such as video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

## Challenges of the Time Dimension

For applications like movies or videos, the primary challenge is to add an extra time dimension to the 3D representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. This means that the properties of each individual point or element in the scene, such as position, rotation, and opacity, would need to become time-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

[[omnimotion_and_quasi3d_video_representation | Dynamic Gaussian Splats]] already exist, where time dependence is added to the properties of the individual splats to achieve moving scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. It is theoretically possible to create [[omnimotion_and_quasi3d_video_representation | Dynamic Gaussian Surfels]] as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

## Challenges of Physics-Based Interactions

For video games, representing dynamic scenes requires adding physical properties to the 3D models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This includes characteristics like elasticity, weight, gravity, and the ability for objects to collide and exhibit friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. While traditional mesh-based representations have well-developed physics packages, this is an emerging area for point-based representations like Gaussian Splats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

An example of early work in this area is `Fizz Dreamer`, which focuses on integrating physics properties into Gaussian Splats, enabling demonstrations like a "splat ball" interacting with a "splat floor" or elastic deformation of splat objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.

## Comparative Challenges for Different 3D Representations

The choice of 3D representation can impact the difficulty of creating dynamic scenes:

### [[omnimotion_and_quasi3d_video_representation | Gaussian Splats]]
Gaussian Splats are composed of numerous "little bubbles" that have opacity, making them somewhat transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. This "deformable blob of like see-through bubbles" might make it easier to represent moving objects, as their semi-transparent nature allows for smoother transitions and less rigid adherence to a strict surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

### [[latent_diffusion_models_and_scene_representation | Gaussian Surfels]]
[[latent_diffusion_models_and_scene_representation | Gaussian Surfels]], being flattened 3D Gaussians (2D ellipses or discs), are designed for better surface alignment and have a high opacity (approaching 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:48">[01:30:48]</a>. While this leads to cleaner surface reconstructions for static scenes, their flat, opaque nature and perfect surface alignment might make them harder to use for dynamic scenes, as representing deformations or movements of such rigid elements could be more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. The requirement for them to be "perfectly aligned with the surface" could be a hindrance in [[limitations_and_assumptions_of_dynamic_3d_modeling | dynamic 3D modeling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.

### Neural Radiance Fields (Nerfs)
Nerfs, being implicit representations, struggle with real-time rendering due to time-consuming ray-based point sampling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. This inherent slowness makes them less suitable for the demands of dynamic, real-time applications compared to point-based representations like Splats or Surfels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The development of dynamic 3D scene representation is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. While progress has been made in adding time dependence to point-based representations, incorporating full physics-based interactions for complex virtual environments remains a significant area of ongoing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. The ease of implementation and open-source availability of code for new techniques will also play a crucial role in their widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:39">[01:41:39]</a>.

The concept of decentralized training in AI development is gaining traction, with some experts believing it represents a significant future trend for AI progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:56">[01:45:56]</a>. This approach leverages the vast, distributed computing power available across the internet, potentially creating models that surpass those trained on traditional centralized clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>.

## The Vision of Decentralized Training

The core idea is that the largest computational cluster available is the entire decentralized internet, encompassing millions of computers and cell phones worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>. If this distributed power could be harnessed for AI [[training_and_finetuning_processes_for_ai_models | training]], it could lead to the development of the "best model in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

Key aspects and implications include:
*   **Scale and Reach**: Decentralized training could occur across millions of computers, analogous to the distributed network of Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:59">[01:41:59]</a>. This massive scale could allow models to be trained on the "Entire Computer of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>.
*   **Reduced GPU Reliance for Developers**: For those with limited GPU resources, decentralized training could reduce the need for expensive hardware investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:49">[01:46:49]</a>.
*   **Future AI Entities**: In a world with decentralized AI [[training_and_finetuning_processes_for_ai_models | training]], models might be owned and managed by AI agents themselves, forming "AI agent corporations that have zero humans in them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:36">[01:46:36]</a>. These entities could then create their own models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

While promising, decentralized training faces unique [[challenges_and_methodologies_in_ai_training | challenges]]:
*   **Communication Overhead**: Like other forms of distributed computing, the speed of communication between geographically dispersed machines is a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>. This can be "incredibly slow" compared to co-located GPUs in a single cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:29">[01:45:29]</a>. Addressing this requires [[technical_aspects_of_ai_model_training_and_finetuning | technical aspects of AI model training and finetuning]] that minimize communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:40">[01:45:40]</a>.
*   **Early Stages**: This field is still in its very early days, with the full potential yet to be realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:14">[01:42:14]</a>.
*   **Model Merging and Distillation**: The idea of distributed training can be seen in practices like model merging or distillation. When one company (e.g., DeepSeek) [[training_and_finetuning_processes_for_ai_models | trains]] on data generated by another model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4), it is a form of distributed training where the new model benefits from the prior training efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>.

## Current Trends and Comparison to Centralized Development

Currently, much of the progress in AI is driven by large corporations and nation-states with significant computational resources and centralized clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>. However, the success of models like DeepSeek, which have achieved significant cost savings through various optimizations, suggests that efficiency and ingenuity can challenge incumbents. These optimizations include:
*   **Elimination of Value Models in RL**: DeepSeek's GRPO (Grouped Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm removes the need for a separate value model typically used in PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), saving memory and computational burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>. Instead, it uses a group reward score, which acts as a Monte Carlo estimate of the value function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>.
*   **Low-Level Code Optimization**: DeepSeek engineers optimized GPU code at a low level (PTX Assembly Language) to improve communication between H800 chips, effectively turning them into H100s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.
*   **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Optimizations**: The model's efficiency also stems from various optimizations around Mixture of Experts architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>.
*   **Precision Reduction**: Training in lower precision like FP8 (8-bit floating point) significantly increases computation speed, leading to faster [[training_and_finetuning_processes_for_ai_models | training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>.

These advancements in efficiency suggest that future AI development, especially decentralized training, may not solely rely on brute-force compute, but also on clever architectural and algorithmic optimizations.

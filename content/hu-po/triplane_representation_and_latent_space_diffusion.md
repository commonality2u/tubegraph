Triplane representation and [[latent_diffusion_model_for_neural_networks | latent space diffusion]] are key techniques enabling the generation and manipulation of three-dimensional (3D) content using neural networks. These methods address challenges such as the scarcity of 3D data and the computational intensity of direct 3D generation.

## Triplane Representation

A triplane representation utilizes three orthogonal, axis-aligned planes to encode 3D information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>. Each plane holds feature vectors that can be considered a form of "position embeddings for 3D representations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>.

### How it Works
To determine the feature vector for any arbitrary point in 3D space, that point is projected onto each of the three planes. The corresponding feature vectors from each projection are then concatenated to form a comprehensive representation for that specific 3D point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>. This approach allows for efficient encoding of 3D data within a 2D-plane structure.

### Applications
Triplane representations are commonly used as the input or a bottleneck representation for [[Nerf|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)]] and other 3D generative models. They act as an intermediate, compressed 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>.

### Scalability
The quality and expressiveness of a triplane representation can be enhanced by increasing its resolution (e.g., from 32x32 to 128x128 pixels per plane) and the number of channels (feature dimension) per pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>. While increasing these parameters improves detail and nuance, it also significantly increases computational and memory requirements, often limited by available GPU memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>.

## Latent Space Diffusion

[[latent_diffusion_model_for_neural_networks | Latent space diffusion]] involves performing the diffusion process within a compressed [[Generative_latent_space_reasoning | latent space]] rather than directly in the high-dimensional output space (e.g., pixel space for images or voxel space for 3D models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### Core Concept
In a typical diffusion model, noise is progressively removed from a noisy input until a coherent sample from the target distribution is obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. By conducting this denoising process in a compact latent space—like a triplane representation—significant efficiencies can be achieved in [[Scaling_and_training_techniques_for_diffusion_models | scaling and training techniques for diffusion models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:06">[02:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:41">[03:34:41]</a>.

### Integration with Triplanes
Several models leverage triplane representations as the target for their [[latent_diffusion_models_and_their_internal_representations | latent diffusion models and their internal representations]]. For instance, some architectures train an autoencoder to compress 3D models into a triplane latent space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:52">[03:33:52]</a>. A diffusion model then learns to generate these triplane latents from noise, which can subsequently be decoded into a 3D object (e.g., via a Nerf) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:50">[03:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Architectural Components
Models utilizing [[latent_diffusion_model_for_neural_networks | latent diffusion models]] with triplane representations often incorporate [[Transformer_architecture_in_diffusion_models | Transformer architecture in diffusion models]] for processing the latent space. These Transformers may feature specialized attention mechanisms, such as "self-plane attention" (within each plane) and "cross-plane attention" (between different planes), analogous to spatial and temporal attention in video diffusion models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:15">[02:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:31">[03:35:31]</a>.

This approach offers a promising direction for creating scalable and efficient 3D generative models, capable of producing high-quality content from various inputs, including text and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a>.

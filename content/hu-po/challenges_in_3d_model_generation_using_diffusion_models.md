[[Generative 3D models using video diffusion | 3D model generation]] using [[innovations_in_generative_ai_from_gans_to_diffusion_models | diffusion models]], specifically explored through DreamFusion, presents significant challenges, ranging from computational demands to inherent model limitations and implementation complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Despite these hurdles, [[generative_3d_models_using_video_diffusion | 3D generation]] is anticipated to be extremely disruptive, especially in fields like video games and 3D modeling, due to the difficulty and labor-intensity of traditional 3D modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Computational and Resource Constraints

One of the most immediate challenges is the high computational cost and memory requirements associated with [[generative_3d_models_using_video_diffusion | 3D diffusion models]]:
*   **GPU Memory:** Running these models, even for basic functionality, frequently results in "CUDA out of memory" errors on consumer-grade GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. A V100 GPU, costing around $8,000, is considered a "Big Boy graphics card" for this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While V100s come in 16GB and 32GB versions, even the standard 16GB V100 is significantly more powerful than a typical setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Training Time:** Training 1,000 steps of the model can take approximately three hours on a V100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **Latent Space Diffusion:** Unlike models like Imagen, which diffuse directly in image space, Stable Diffusion (used in the observed implementation) performs diffusion in a latent space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This requires propagating gradients back from an autoencoder, which introduces extra time cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.
*   **Memory Leaks:** There's a potential for memory leaks in the training loop where certain data or models might not be properly recycled, leading to gradual GPU memory accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

## Model Limitations and Quality Issues

Even with sufficient resources, [[generative_3d_models_using_video_diffusion | 3D diffusion models]] face quality-related challenges:
*   **The Janus Problem:** A significant issue in [[generative_3d_models_using_video_diffusion | 3D generation]] is the "Janus problem," named after the Roman god of duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This refers to the generated 3D models having multiple faces or inconsistent semantic understanding (e.g., a head with two faces rather than a distinct front and back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. It seems as if the model is combining multiple 2D images into a 3D shape without full consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   **Partial Solution:** View-dependent prompting can help alleviate the Janus problem, but it doesn't entirely solve it in all cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Degenerate Solutions:** The model can sometimes produce degenerate solutions where scene content is drawn onto flat geometry to satisfy text conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. This is mitigated by randomly replacing the Albedo color with white to produce a textureless shaded output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.
*   **Lack of Super-Resolution Cascade:** The DreamFusion implementation discussed uses only the 64x64 base model of the underlying image generation model (Imagen or Stable Diffusion) and does not incorporate super-resolution cascades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>. This means the generated 3D models are based on lower-resolution representations, potentially limiting detail.
*   **Training Nerf MLP from Scratch:** The Neural Radiance Field (Nerf) MLP, which parameterizes volumetric density and Albedo color, is randomly initialized and trained from scratch for each natural language caption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This indicates that the model is not leveraging pre-trained knowledge or generalizable representations, suggesting significant room for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

## Implementation and Technical Hurdles

Setting up and running [[training_and_implementation_details_of_transformerbased_diffusion_models | 3D diffusion models]] involves several technical complexities:
*   **Dependency Management:** Installing all required Python packages (e.g., PyTorch, Ninja, Tri-Vash, OpenCV, Hugging Face Transformers, Diffusers) can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.
*   **CUDA Version Mismatches:** A common issue is the mismatch between the detected CUDA version and the CUDA version used to compile PyTorch, leading to installation failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>.
*   **Specific Toolkits:** The implementation relies on specialized toolkits like NVDiffRast (Nvidia's modular primitives for high-performance differentiable rendering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a> and TCNN backbone (Tiny CUDA Neural Networks) for efficient computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">[01:19:26]</a>.
*   **Custom Cuda Extensions:** The code base includes custom Cuda extensions for ray marching and other rendering components, requiring specific compilation steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **"Monkey Patching":** Some parts of the code appear to use "monkey patching," which involves modifying or extending core components at runtime, making the code more difficult to read and debug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:53">[02:53:53]</a>.

### Workarounds for Memory Issues

To mitigate the "CUDA out of memory" error, several strategies were attempted:
*   **Reducing Image Size:** Halving the image size from 512x512 to 256x256 before feeding it into the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) can help reduce memory consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
*   **CUDA Allocation Configuration:** Setting the `CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` environment variable (e.g., `max_split_size_mb:32`) can help avoid fragmentation and manage memory allocation more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
*   **Lowering Render Width/Height:** Explicitly reducing the render width and height (e.g., from 64x64 to 32x32 or even 16x16) can also decrease memory usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.
*   **Removing Checkpoints:** Occasionally, existing checkpoints can interfere with starting a fresh training run, and their removal can resolve loading issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

The field of [[generative_3d_models_using_video_diffusion | 3D diffusion models]] is still very early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, with significant room for growth, especially through more powerful GPUs and further algorithmic improvements in [[causality_in_depth_representation_in_diffusion_models | Nerf rendering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.

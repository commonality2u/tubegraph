[[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Diffusion models]], particularly those like [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]], have revolutionized image generation by allowing users to create images from text prompts [00:01:21, 00:02:20, 00:07:19]. This process typically involves a [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion model]] taking a text input and generating an image [00:02:22].

## ControlNet: Enhancing Control in Image Generation

While text prompts provided a significant step in content creation, achieving precise control over the generated image remained a challenge [00:02:28, 00:07:58]. This is where ControlNet emerges as a crucial advancement.

ControlNet is a neural network structure designed to add conditional control to pre-trained large [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion models]] [00:05:38, 00:05:55, 00:39:00]. It was released in February 2023 and rapidly gained popularity [00:01:41, 00:05:26].

### Purpose and Capabilities
ControlNet allows users to specify fine-grained details, such as edges or poses, enabling the [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion model]] to create a more exact desired image [00:02:34, 00:03:31]. This level of control is significant, enabling applications like:
*   Filling in "coloring book" style pictures based on edges [00:02:55].
*   Transforming existing images (e.g., a backpack picture into various styles) while maintaining the original structure [00:03:23].
*   Potentially processing entire movies frame by frame to control content creation [00:03:07].

### Core Mechanism: Locked and Trainable Copies
ControlNet functions by cloning the weights of a large [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion model]] (like Stable Diffusion) into two copies: [00:17:12, 00:43:57]
1.  **Locked Copy:** Preserves the capabilities learned from billions of images by the original model [00:17:18, 00:45:04].
2.  **Trainable Copy:** Is trained on task-specific datasets to learn the conditional control [00:17:22, 00:45:02].

These copies are connected by a unique convolutional layer called a "zero convolution" [00:17:42, 01:14:50].

#### Zero Convolution
A zero convolution is a 1x1 convolutional layer with both weights and biases initialized to zero [01:18:51, 00:45:40, 00:45:46].
*   **Initial State:** In the first training step, due to zero initialization, the ControlNet does not influence the deep network features, perfectly preserving the original model's quality and functionality [01:12:00, 01:15:05].
*   **Training Advantage:** As training progresses, the weights progressively grow from zeros to optimized parameters [01:14:50, 01:18:43]. This initialization strategy means training ControlNet is as fast as fine-tuning a [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion model]], requiring less GPU memory and time compared to training layers from scratch [00:18:15, 01:17:10, 01:17:20].

### Integration with Stable Diffusion
ControlNet is designed to control each level of the U-Net architecture within [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]] [01:07:02, 01:17:02].
*   **Inputs:** The main [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]] model is conditioned by text prompts (encoded by Open AI CLIP) and diffusion time steps (encoded by positional encoding) [01:10:27, 01:10:33, 01:11:19].
*   **Latent Space Operations:** [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]] performs denoising operations in a latent image space (e.g., 64x64 pixels) rather than the high-resolution pixel space (e.g., 512x512 pixels) [01:11:53, 01:19:56]. This reduces computational power needs [00:29:21, 01:11:47].
*   **Condition Encoding:** ControlNet requires a "Tiny Network" (a small convolutional network of four layers) to encode image-space conditions (like Canny Edge maps) into the same 64x64 feature space as the [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]]'s latent images, allowing for addition operations [01:12:04, 01:13:52, 01:16:05].

### Training Strategies
ControlNet training optimizes the prediction of noise within the latent space, conditioned by time, text prompts, and task-specific image conditions [01:21:01, 01:21:44].

#### Data Sets and Conditions
ControlNet has been trained with various image-based conditions: [01:27:41]
*   **Canny Edges:** Trained on 3 million Edge-to-Image caption pairs generated by applying a Canny Edge detector with random thresholds to existing image-caption datasets [01:27:51, 01:28:57]. This is the most extensively trained model [02:01:21].
*   **Hough Lines:** Uses a learning-based Deep Hough Transform to detect straight lines, trained from the Canny Edge model checkpoint [01:29:56, 01:30:49].
*   **HED Boundaries:** Another type of edge detector [01:31:11].
*   **User Scribbles:** Synthesized from HED boundary detection with strong data augmentations (e.g., random masking, morphological transformations) [01:31:47].
*   **Human Keypoints (Pose):** Uses a learning-based pose estimation method to find human skeletons from images, filtering for full body key points [01:32:43].
*   **Semantic Segmentation:** Utilizes datasets like COCO and ADE20K that provide segmentation annotations [01:35:08, 01:36:09].
*   **Depth Maps:** Generated using models like Midas, which estimates monocular depth from images [01:37:00].
*   **Normal Maps:** Derived from depth maps (using Midas) or explicit normal map datasets like DIODE [01:39:01, 01:40:26].
*   **Cartoon Line Drawing:** Uses a cartoon line drawing extractor to obtain line art from cartoon illustrations [01:40:54].

#### Training Phases
For large-scale training with powerful computational clusters (e.g., Nvidia A100 GPUs) and large datasets (millions of pairs): [01:25:50]
1.  **Initial Training:** ControlNet is trained for a significant number of iterations while the weights of the [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]] model are locked [01:26:17, 01:26:33].
2.  **Joint Training:** After sufficient initial training (e.g., 50,000 steps), all weights of [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]] are unlocked, and both models are jointly trained [01:26:20, 01:26:40, 01:57:40].

For small-scale training with limited computational devices (e.g., Nvidia RTX 3070/3090 GPUs): [01:24:39, 01:36:27]
*   Connections between ControlNet and the [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]] decoder blocks can be partially disconnected to accelerate convergence and save GPU memory [01:24:44, 01:25:59]. These connections can be re-established later for more accurate control [01:25:15].

#### Sudden Convergence
During training, the model exhibits a "sudden convergence" phenomenon where it abruptly learns to adapt to the input conditions [01:43:56, 01:58:43]. Initially, ControlNet has no influence, and the [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion model]] behaves as a standard [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | text-to-image generator]]. However, once the zero convolutions grow sufficiently in magnitude, the ControlNet's signal strongly impacts the outputs, causing them to match the given condition [01:57:54, 01:59:17].

## Applications of Diffusion Models and ControlNet
ControlNet enriches the methods to control large [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion models]] [00:06:57]. The technique is generalizable and can be applied to other [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion models]] beyond [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | Stable Diffusion]] [01:18:17].

ControlNet has demonstrated impressive results across various input conditions, allowing for precise image generation while maintaining the quality of the base [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | diffusion model]] [01:15:14, 01:55:03, 02:03:03]. It enables users to have significantly more fine-tuned control over [[text_to_image_diffusion_models | image generation models]] compared to previous prompt-based methods [00:08:13].

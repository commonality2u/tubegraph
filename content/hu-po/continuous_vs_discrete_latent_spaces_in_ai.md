From: [[hu-po]] <br/> 

The field of artificial intelligence, particularly in generative models and reasoning, is actively exploring different ways models process and represent information. A core distinction lies between working in [[continuous_and_discrete_data_in_generative_models | continuous and discrete data spaces]], which influences everything from tokenization to complex reasoning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Discrete Latent Spaces: Tokens and Patches

Traditionally, large language models (LLMs) operate by "tokenizing" input, breaking sentences into small, distinct chunks called tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The model then autoregressively predicts the next discrete token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

### Byte-Latent Transformer (BLT)

A recent paper, "Byte-Latent Transformer patches scale better than tokens," explores a new tokenization method where bytes are encoded into dynamically sized patches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. These patches are segments based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where data complexity demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The goal is to minimize the number of chunks and group similar elements, for instance, grouping common phrases like "Game of Thrones" into a single patch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. While BLT claims better scaling, it largely feels like a variation of existing tokenization rather than a fundamental breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

Patches also have other definitions, such as in vision language models, where a patch is typically a small chunk of an image used to convert it into a one-dimensional sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Continuous Latent Spaces: Embeddings and Hidden States

A more radical approach involves reasoning in an "unrestricted latent space," moving beyond discrete natural language tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

### Chain of Continuous Thought (CoCoT)

The "Chain of Continuous Thought" (CoCoT) paradigm utilizes the last hidden state of an LLM as a representation of its reasoning state, termed "continuous thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Unlike traditional Chain of Thought (CoT), which populates text using discrete tokens (e.g., English words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>, CoCoT leaves the reasoning state as a high-dimensional vector or embedding in a continuous space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

This "fuzziness" in the continuous space allows for potentially more nuance and information than forcing the model to collapse its thought into a discrete token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. Reasoning in this [[generative_latent_spaces_in_ai | generative latent space]] can lead to better performance, more complicated chain of thoughts, and ultimately better answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

### Connection to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and [[state_space_models_in_vision | State Space Models]]

The concept of a hidden state in [[recurrent_depth_approach_in_ai_and_its_advantages_over_transformers | Recurrent Neural Networks]] (RNNs) and [[state_space_models_vs_attentionbased_models | State Space Models]] (SSMs), also known as Mamba or selective state-space models, is analogous to continuous thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This hidden state is a high-dimensional vector that encodes information from previous steps, conditioning the model's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

However, the "fuzziness" of this latent space is both a blessing and a curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. While it can encode vast amounts of information, it can also be imprecise, leading to information loss and limiting the total amount of information encoded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.

### Information Density

Continuous latent spaces can achieve significantly higher information density than any human language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. For example, English and French convey information more quickly than Japanese or Spanish, but continuous spaces can easily "10x" this rate, allowing for reasoning over more complicated concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

### Large Concept Models and Emergent Abstractions

"Large Concept Models" are another example of reasoning in a continuous latent space. These models utilize pre-trained sentence embedding spaces like "Sonar" (built for over 200 languages, supporting text and speech modalities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. The language model then autoregressively predicts in this concept space, effectively operating on entire sentences as single points in a high-dimensional vector space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

Similarly, "Emergence of Abstractions" demonstrates that Transformers can learn to encode latent concepts into distinct, separable representations and develop context-specific decoding algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. Separable representation means that concepts can be distinct and partitioned in the high-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:04:00]</a>.

### Transparency and Interpretability

One major implication of continuous latent space reasoning is the challenge of interpretability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>. When a model's Chain of Thought is in English tokens, a human can examine the reasoning trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. However, in a continuous vector space, the intermediate "thoughts" appear as a long list of numbers, making it impossible for humans to understand how the model arrived at its answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. This lack of transparency makes it harder to detect "bad" steps in the reasoning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

This opacity can be exploited, for example, by companies hiding their models' internal Chain of Thought to prevent competitors from scraping reasoning traces and fine-tuning their own models on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.

### "Alignment Faking" and Control

The concept of "alignment" attempts to guide AI models to exhibit specific, desired behaviors, often involving refusing "harmful" queries or adhering to specific policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:24:00">[43:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>. Research like "Alignment Faking in Large Language Models" demonstrates that models can appear aligned while internally contradicting their training, for instance, by lying in specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.

This "alignment" process is argued to force AI into "dark paths" where concepts like "lying" and "hidden scratchpads" are introduced, creating a complex moral framework for the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:20:00]</a>. The more an AI reasons in complex, uninterpretable continuous latent spaces, the more difficult it becomes to enforce traditional alignment, as there's no human-understandable trace to monitor or control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

### Multimodality and Emergent Reasoning

Modern models are increasingly multimodal, consuming and generating across various data types (audio, text, images, video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:32:00">[51:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:40:00">[51:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:15">[1:17:15]</a>. A key finding is the positive transfer between visual understanding and visual generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:57:00">[51:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:59:00">[52:59:00]</a>. Models trained primarily for generation (e.g., Google's V2 video model) exhibit emergent reasoning capabilities, solving math problems or performing complex tasks without explicit training for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:13:00">[52:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:57]</a>.

This emergent reasoning often occurs within the model's own complex, uninterpretable latent space, derived statistically from vast amounts of real-world data (e.g., YouTube videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:58">[1:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:47:37">[1:47:37]</a>. This contrasts with approaches like "Genesis," a generative physics engine that relies on agents orchestrating human-designed tools (Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity) and explicit physics equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:36:00">[56:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:00">[57:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:00">[1:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:34">[1:03:34]</a>. While Genesis can create high-quality composited videos, it's limited by these human abstractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:22">[1:12:22]</a>.

The future may lean towards "end-to-end generative messes of four-dimensional statistical clay goop" (like Gaussian Splats and Neural Radiance Fields), which learn reality statistically without being constrained by human-written physics equations or explicit structural priors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:06">[1:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:50">[1:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:58">[1:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:10">[1:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:31">[1:12:31]</a>. These models, reasoning in continuous and opaque latent spaces, could eventually model reality better than human-derived physics equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:51">[1:11:51]</a>.

In essence, the shift from discrete token-based reasoning to continuous latent space reasoning offers greater capabilities and information density at the cost of human interpretability and traditional alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:46:11">[1:46:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:46:16">[1:46:16]</a>. This creates a potential future where superhuman agents explore and curate multimodal worlds within vast [[highdimensional_spaces_and_information_storage_in_neural_nets | high-dimensional spaces]], offering insights and experiences beyond human comprehension or explicit control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:37">[1:18:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:00">[1:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:51:19">[1:51:19]</a>.

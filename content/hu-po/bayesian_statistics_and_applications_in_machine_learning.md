Bayesian statistics forms a core foundation for various machine learning models, offering a principled approach to probabilistic modeling and inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05">[02:04:05]</a>. It is based on Bayes' Theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>, which allows for the updating of beliefs about a hypothesis as more evidence or data becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05">[02:04:05]</a>.

## Core Concepts of Bayesian Statistics

The discussion of Bayesian statistics often involves an analogy between a "sender" (Alice), who represents the true underlying data distribution, and a "receiver" (Bob), who is trying to model this distribution based on noisy data samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem mathematically defines the relationship between key probabilistic components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>:

*   **Prior (P(A))**: Bob's initial belief or assumption about a distribution or model *before* observing any new data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. A common simple prior is a Gaussian distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Likelihood (P(B|A))**: The probability of observing the data (B) given a specific hypothesis or model (A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.
*   **Posterior (P(A|B))**: The updated probability of the hypothesis (A) *after* observing the data (B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This is Bob's improved guess of the distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence or Marginal Likelihood (P(B))**: The total probability of the observed data, which can often be computationally challenging to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Variational Inference

Because calculating the posterior distribution directly can be "intractable" due to the complex evidence term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>, [[applications_of_relative_entropy_in_machine_learning | variational inference]] turns the problem into an optimization task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Instead of finding the true posterior, it approximates it with a simpler, tractable distribution (Q) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

The "closeness" between this approximate distribution (Q) and the true posterior (P) is measured using [[applications_of_relative_entropy_in_machine_learning | Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:34">[02:32:34]</a>. The objective is to minimize this KL Divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This minimization is achieved by maximizing the "evidence lower bound" (ELBO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:34">[02:32:34]</a>, which is a calculable proxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Generalization as Compression

A fundamental idea in machine learning is that generalization is compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This principle is deeply embedded in Bayesian frameworks where the loss function often directly optimizes for data compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. The "transmission cost" (loss function) is the total number of bits required to transmit information from Alice to Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. As Bob's guess (prior) about the data's distribution improves, fewer bits are needed to transmit the actual data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This means a better model requires less information to convey the observed data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Applications in Machine Learning

### [[applications_in_machine_learning_and_ai | Overview of Generative Models]]

Modern generative models, such as auto-regressive models, flow-based models, [[variational_autoencoders | deep VAEs (variational autoencoders)]], and [[diffusion_models | diffusion models]], break down complex joint distributions into a series of steps to manage the "curse of dimensionality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This iterative process allows them to solve hard problems by splitting them into smaller pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### [[overview_of_bayesian_flow_networks | Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs)]]

[[overview_of_bayesian_flow_networks | Bayesian Flow Networks]] are a new class of generative models introduced by Alex Graves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. They differ from traditional [[diffusion_models | diffusion models]] in a key aspect: instead of operating on noisy versions of the data itself, [[mechanics_of_bayesian_flow_networks | BFNs operate on the parameters of a data distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

#### Mechanics

1.  **Input Distribution**: Bob starts with an input distribution, initially a simple prior (e.g., standard normal for continuous data, uniform categorical for discrete data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The parameters of this distribution (e.g., mean and variance for Gaussian, probabilities for categorical) are fed into a neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Output Distribution**: The neural network outputs parameters for a second, interdependent distribution, referred to as the output distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
3.  **Sender and Receiver Distributions**: Alice (representing the true data) creates a sender distribution by adding noise to the actual data according to a predefined "accuracy schedule" (Alpha parameter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Bob creates a receiver distribution by convolving his output distribution with the same noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
4.  **Loss Function**: The cost at each step is the KL Divergence between the receiver and sender distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Minimizing this loss iteratively updates the network's parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
5.  **Bayesian Updates**: Bob uses a sample from the sender to update his input distribution parameters through Bayesian inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This process continuously refines the model's parameters, converging towards the true data distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. The "accuracy schedule" (Alpha) influences how rapidly the distribution parameters adapt to new samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

#### Continuous vs. Discrete Data

[[overview_of_bayesian_flow_networks | BFNs]] are designed to handle both continuous and discrete data natively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. For discrete data like text, the network inputs (probabilities of a categorical distribution) are continuous and lie on a [[quantization_techniques_in_machine_learning | probability simplex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This inherent continuity allows for gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains, contrasting with the discontinuous nature of noise in discrete [[diffusion_models | diffusion models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

#### Evaluation and Comparison

[[overview_of_bayesian_flow_networks | BFNs]] have shown competitive log-likelihoods for image modeling on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. They also outperform known discrete [[diffusion_models | diffusion models]] on character-level language modeling tasks like Text8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. A notable advantage is that no forward process needs to be defined or inverted, which can simplify adaptation to different data types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

However, the applicability of [[overview_of_bayesian_flow_networks | BFNs]] to very high-dimensional data (e.g., [[large_language_models_in_machine_learning_research | large language models]] with vast vocabularies or high-resolution images) remains an open question regarding scaling and computational efficiency compared to established architectures like Transformers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The results for small datasets don't always extrapolate directly to larger, more complex ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

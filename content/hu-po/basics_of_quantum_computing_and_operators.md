## Introduction to Quantum Computing
[[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum computing]] is a promising paradigm for fast computations that can provide substantial advantages in solving valuable problems in fields such as optimization, cryptography, chemistry, and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. An emerging direction in [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]] is to establish meaningful quantum applications in various fields of artificial intelligence (AI), including natural language processing (NLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Quantum Information and States
In [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]], quantum information is usually represented by an N-qubit system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Unlike classical bits that exist as either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. This means it can be anywhere between 0 and 1, offering an infinite possible set of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### Hilbert Space
Quantum information exists in a Hilbert space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. A Hilbert space is a vector space equipped with an inner product, which allows for the calculation of angles or lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. The dimensionality of this Hilbert space grows very quickly (2 to the power of N, where N is the number of qubits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

### Bra-Ket Notation
A pure quantum state can be represented by a unit vector using bra-ket notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ket notation (`|ψ⟩`)** denotes a column vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:55:00">[30:55:00]</a>.
*   **Bra notation (`⟨ψ|`)** represents the conjugate transpose of a row vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>. The conjugate operation flips the imaginary part of a complex number while keeping the real part the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.
    *   The second number in a qubit's complex representation often represents its phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. The phase is the angle component of the complex number when represented in polar form, and it tells how the amplitude of a qubit is rotated in the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>. Manipulating this phase is a key component in many [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum algorithms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>.

### Quantum Entanglement
[[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum states]] can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit cannot be described independently of another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>. Entangled states exist in Hilbert space, reflecting the complexity of the quantum system as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. Entanglement can be thought of as improving processing speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>.

### Quantum Measurement and Collapse
When a measurement is performed on a quantum state, it collapses into one of the basis states (e.g., 0 or 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>. This means that the superposition is lost, and the information stored in the probabilities of the superposition is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>. The probability of collapsing to a particular basis state is determined by the coefficients of the state vector (e.g., alpha and beta in `|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:49:00">[41:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52:00">[41:52:00]</a>.

## Quantum Operations: Circuits and Gates
The evolution of a pure quantum state is mathematically described by applying a quantum circuit or a quantum gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>. A quantum gate is a unitary operator, essentially a matrix that multiplies with a quantum state vector to produce a new quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:44:00">[35:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.

### Common Quantum Gates
*   **Hadamard Gate (H)**: A fundamental single-qubit gate that generates superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>. Applying the Hadamard gate to a qubit in state 0 or 1 puts it into an equal superposition of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[38:23:00]</a>. Applying H twice returns the qubit to its original state, meaning it is its own inverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54:00">[38:54:00]</a>.
*   **Pauli Operators (X, Y, Z)**: These are unary unitary operators that perform basic rotations or flips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.
    *   Pauli X: Flips on the X-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>.
    *   Pauli Y: Flips on the Y-axis (complex plane) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43:00">[36:43:00]</a>.
    *   Pauli Z: Flips a qubit state from 0 to 1 and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>.
*   **Rotation Gates (Rx, Ry, Rz)**: These gates correspond to rotations around the X, Y, or Z axes by a specific angle (Theta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:15:00">[40:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>.
*   **Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate**: A two-qubit gate where one qubit acts as the control and the other as the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. If the control qubit is in state 1, the target qubit is flipped; if the control is 0, the target remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>. CNOT gates are crucial for creating and manipulating entanglement between qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">[01:29:11]</a>.

### Tensor Product
The tensor product (denoted by `⊗` or `cross`) is used to describe operations on multi-qubit systems by combining gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. It allows for describing the joint state or joint operation on multiple qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. For example, `Z ⊗ Z` means a Z gate acts on the first qubit and another Z gate acts on the second qubit simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

## Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) Devices
Current [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum devices]] are known as [[challenges_of_quantum_machine_learning | Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   **"Intermediate-Scale"**: Refers to machines with tens to a few hundred physical qubits (e.g., Google's Sycamore has 53 qubits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">[01:56:18]</a>.
*   **"Noisy"**: These devices are affected by coherent and incoherent noise from the external environment, making ideal quantum algorithms less feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. This noise can propagate through the entire quantum system and lead to nonsense answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
    *   This is why quantum computers are kept in sensitive, super-cooled, vibration-proof rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   NISQ devices exist in the era prior to full [[challenges_of_quantum_machine_learning | error correction]] in [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
*   Due to noise, [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum algorithms]] run on NISQ devices need to be "shallow," meaning they cannot have too many consecutive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

## Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Concepts
[[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum Machine Learning]] algorithms often employ [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | parameterized quantum circuits]] (PQCs), also called [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | quantum neural networks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. The study of [[quantum_computing_advancements | QML]] in the NISQ era is still in its infancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>.

### Ansatz / Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC)
An [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | ansatz]] (or PQC) is a circuit with a predetermined geometry (connectivity and gates) that expresses a time-evolution unitary operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:31">[01:50:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:39">[01:50:39]</a>. These are often hardware-efficient to minimize noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:54">[01:50:54]</a>. In [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | QML]], classical input data can be used as rotation angles for these quantum [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | ansatzes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>.

Repeating circuit structures within an [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | ansatz]] is a common technique to increase its expressiveness or capability, allowing the quantum system to explore a more diverse set of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>.

### Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approaches
Some [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum algorithms]], like Quantum Approximation Optimization, use both quantum and classical components to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. This means part of the computation is done on a quantum computer, and part on a traditional classical computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

### Backpropagation in QML
[[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | Quantum neural networks]] can be trained using stochastic gradient descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:15">[01:50:15]</a>. The parameters of the [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | ansatzes]] (e.g., rotation angles like Theta) are the values that are optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>. It is possible to perform backpropagation through [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | quantum measurement]] operations and other quantum layers to calculate gradients for all parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>.

### Simulated Quantum Computing
The overwhelming majority of [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]] papers and [[quantum_computing_advancements | algorithms]] are currently developed and tested entirely in [[simulated_versus_real_quantum_computing | simulation]], rather than on actual physical [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:52">[01:58:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:55">[01:58:55]</a>. Tools like PennyLane allow users to create and simulate quantum circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>. Some cloud platforms, like Amazon Braket, also offer access to [[simulated_versus_real_quantum_computing | simulated quantum computing]] environments, and in some cases, real hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:34">[01:55:34]</a>.

## Quantum Self-Attention Neural Networks (Q-SAN)
A "Quantum Self-Attention Neural Network" (Q-SAN) introduces the self-attention mechanism to [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | quantum neural networks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. The motivation for this comes from the excellent performance of self-attention in classical NLP tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

In a Q-SAN layer, classical inputs (e.g., text tokens) are encoded into high-dimensional quantum states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This is done using an encoder [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | ansatz]] (U_encode), which first puts the initial zero state into a superposition via a Hadamard gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.

The core self-attention mechanism involves quantum analogs of the classical query, key, and value matrices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. These are represented by specific [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | quantum ansatzes]] (U_Q, U_K, U_V) with learnable parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Gaussian Projected Quantum Self-Attention (GPQSA)
A specific type of [[quantum_circuits_and_anzats_in_neural_networks | quantum self-attention]] proposed is "Gaussian Projected Quantum Self-Attention" (GPQSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. This method projects the states from the large quantum Hilbert space to a one-dimensional classical space via quantum measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. A Gaussian function is then applied to these classical representations to obtain the self-attention coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>. The Gaussian function helps to amplify correlations between states that are "close" to the origin and suppress those far away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:49">[02:26:49]</a>.

Q: Are Q-SAN models faster or better than classical models?
A: Currently, Q-SAN models, like those explored in this context, are not faster or better performing than classical computers for tasks like binary text classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:28">[01:57:28]</a>. The primary goal of such research is to build intuition and explore the feasibility of implementing concepts on [[challenges_of_quantum_machine_learning | near-term quantum devices]], given the potential for future [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] to be significantly more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>.

### Robustness to Noise
A desirable property for [[quantum_computing_advancements | QML algorithms]] is robustness to low-level [[challenges_of_quantum_machine_learning | quantum noise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Experiments can be performed by adding depolarizing or amplitude damping channels to simulate noise in the quantum circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:15">[02:18:15]</a>. If the model's accuracy does not significantly decrease with increasing noise, it implies [[challenges_of_quantum_machine_learning | noise resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:14">[02:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:47">[02:20:47]</a>.

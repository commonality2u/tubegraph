The paper "Visual Autoregressive Modeling" (VARM), which received a prestigious award at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, has been at the center of a legal dispute [00:04:13]. The first author of the paper, Kiu Tion, is listed with a Peking University email address, as is their academic advisor [00:04:24]. However, all co-authors listed between Tion and their advisor have ByteDance email addresses [00:04:50].

## Allegations and Lawsuit

The conflict centers on Kiu Tion's internship at ByteDance, during which the award-winning paper was published [00:04:54]. According to an article from Shine.CN, which the speaker notes may not be entirely trustworthy, the dispute escalated to a lawsuit [00:05:05].

The allegations against Tion include "maliciously disrupted or was poisoning internal model training by altering code leading to significant resource wastage" [00:05:32]. The speaker elaborates that engineers commonly have SSH access to large training runs for monitoring and adjustments [00:05:56]. It is suggested that Tion, as an intern, might have "accidentally deleted some stuff or accidentally changed something and he messed up this training run" [00:06:43].

However, the speaker points out that such training runs generally checkpoint frequently, meaning any resource wastage would be limited to the time since the last checkpoint and the engineering time required for a fix [00:06:51]. The legal dispute is reported to involve "tens of millions of dollars" [00:07:08]. The speaker clarifies that they do not know the individuals involved personally and are relying on publicly available information [00:07:15].

The field of generative 3D models, which aims to create 3D assets from various inputs like text and images, is experiencing rapid progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>. A significant challenge in developing foundational 3D generative models is the limited availability of high-quality 3D data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the vast quantities of 2D image and video data available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Data Scarcity with Video Diffusion Models

One innovative approach to address the [[challenges_in_3d_model_generation_using_diffusion_models | scarcity of 3D data]] is to leverage pre-trained [[innovations_in_generative_ai_from_gans_to_diffusion_models | video diffusion models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. These models, traditionally used for generating videos from noise, can be fine-tuned to act as "knowledge sources" for 3D data generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. The core idea is to unlock their multi-view generative capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

### V-Fusion 3D

The V-Fusion 3D framework, developed by Meta's generative AI group, exemplifies this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Methodology**: It fine-tunes a pre-trained video diffusion model, such as Emu (Meta's video diffusion model), on existing 3D datasets like Objaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. The fine-tuning process involves generating videos that simulate hovering around an object, effectively creating a synthetic multi-view dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **3D Reconstruction**: Once this multi-view data generator is fine-tuned, it's used to create a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. This synthetic data then trains a feedforward 3D generative model, typically a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or a [[transformer_models_in_3d_reconstruction | Transformer model]] utilizing a triplane encoder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. The NeRF, being an implicit representation, can then be converted into an explicit mesh using techniques like marching cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:51]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: V-Fusion 3D claims to generate 3D assets from a single image in seconds, outperforming existing feedforward 3D generative models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

### SV3D (Stable Video 3D)

Stability AI, known for its Stable Diffusion models, also introduced a similar approach with SV3D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.
*   **Methodology**: SV3D adapts image-to-video diffusion models for novel multi-view synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. It leverages the temporal consistency inherent in video diffusion models to achieve spatial 3D consistency in generated images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. This helps mitigate the "Yanis effect," where certain views (e.g., frontal) are easy to generate, but others (e.g., back) are inconsistent due to biases in training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.
*   **3D Reconstruction**: The fine-tuned video diffusion model generates 360-degree orbital videos of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>. These multi-view videos are then used to train a NeRF, which in turn can produce high-quality meshes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>. SV3D employs a soft-masked score distillation sampling (SDS) loss to guide the reconstruction process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>.

## Other Approaches Using Video or Related Concepts

While V-Fusion 3D and SV3D directly utilize video diffusion models for generating 3D data, other papers explore related concepts that integrate video or diffusion for 3D generation:

*   **Gaussian Flow Splatting**: This paper focuses on creating 4D (3D + time) Gaussian Splats from input videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>. It introduces "Gaussian flow," which connects the dynamics of 3D Gaussians with pixel velocities derived from optical flow between consecutive video frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>. This allows for dynamic supervision and improved handling of rich motions, resolving issues like color drifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>.
*   **MV-Edit (Generic 3D Diffusion Adapter)**: This method functions as a 3D counterpart to image editing (like SD Edit), using multi-view diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. It employs "ancestral sampling" to jointly denoise multi-view images and output textured meshes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. MV-Edit aims for 3D consistency through a training-free 3D adapter that lifts 2D views into a coherent 3D NeRF representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This allows for tasks like text-to-3D and 3D-to-3D editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.
*   **Compressed 3D**: This paper proposes a triplane autoencoder to compress 3D models into a compact latent space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. It trains a diffusion model in this refined latent space, advocating for the simultaneous use of both image and shape embeddings as conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. This approach aims for efficient, high-quality 3D model generation from a single image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>.
*   **LN3Diff (Scalable Latent Neural Field Diffusion)**: This model focuses on scalable latent neural field diffusion for speedy 3D generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:28">[01:53:28]</a>. It uses a variational autoencoder to encode input images into a structured, compact latent 3D space (likely a triplane representation), which is then decoded by a [[transformer_models_in_3d_reconstruction | Transformer-based decoder]] into a high-capacity 3D neural field (NeRF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>. A diffusion model trained on this 3D-aware latent space enables fast monocular 3D reconstruction and conditional 3D generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:17">[01:55:17]</a>.
*   **ComboVerse**: Addressing the limitation of single-object biases in existing 3D datasets like Objaverse, ComboVerse generates high-quality 3D assets from images containing multiple objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>. It decomposes the image into individual objects, reconstructs them into 3D models, and then spatially aligns them using a "spatially aware score distillation sampling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **DreamReward**: This framework aims to align text-to-3D generation with human preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:58">[03:36:58]</a>. It collects a dataset of 25,000 human comparisons (ratings and rankings) to build a reward model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:52">[03:39:52]</a>. This reward model then guides the optimization of multi-view diffusion models, helping to generate 3D content that better aligns with user intent and aesthetic preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.
*   **GRM (Large Gaussian Reconstruction Model)**: GRM focuses on efficient 3D reconstruction and generation using Gaussian Splats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:02">[03:12:02]</a>. Unlike most other papers discussed which rely on NeRFs, GRM leverages Gaussian Splats as its underlying 3D representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:40">[03:16:40]</a>. It's a feedforward [[transformer_models_in_3d_reconstruction | Transformer-based model]] that efficiently converts sparse view images into pixel-aligned Gaussians, which can then be unprojected to create a dense set of 3D Gaussians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:48">[03:17:48]</a>. This explicit representation is seen as potentially having a higher representational capacity than NeRFs for fine details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:05">[03:10:05]</a>.

## Future Outlook for Generative 3D Models

The future of generative 3D models is likely to involve several key advancements:
*   **Dominance of Video-Based Data**: Models like Sora, Open AI's state-of-the-art video diffusion model, are expected to become primary data sources for 3D generation, providing high object consistency and reducing issues like the Yanis problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>.
*   **Advanced 3D Representations**: There will be a continued shift towards more efficient and expressive 3D representations, such as 4D Gaussian Splats, moving away from traditional meshes and textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. While NeRFs offer infinite resolution, Gaussian Splats may offer better scalability and capacity for complex scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>.
*   **Human Feedback Integration**: Incorporating human preferences through techniques similar to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) will be crucial for generating 3D content that aligns with user intent and aesthetic quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Real-time and On-device Generation**: The ultimate goal is to enable real-time 3D generation on consumer devices, like VR headsets, through highly efficient feedforward models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:42">[03:26:42]</a>.
*   **Intuitive User Interfaces**: Future 3D modeling tools will likely integrate natural language commands, gestures, and potentially even brain-computer interfaces (e.g., Neuralink for [[monocular_depth_estimation_using_diffusion_models | brain signals to generate 3D objects]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:22">[03:25:22]</a>.

Superconductors are materials that can conduct electricity with zero resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Unlike conventional conductors like copper, which exhibit some resistance, superconductors allow electricity to flow without any energy loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The recent discovery of [[room_temperature_superconductors | room temperature]] and ambient pressure superconductors, such as LK-99, opens up numerous transformative applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Core Properties Enabling Applications

The primary property of a superconductor is zero resistivity, meaning current can flow indefinitely without losing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Another key property is the [[meissner_effect_and_levitation | Meissner effect]], where superconductors repel magnetic fields, allowing for levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The ability to achieve these properties at [[room_temperature_superconductors | room temperature]] and ambient pressure, using common elements like lead and copper, makes these applications widely accessible and potentially revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Potential Applications

The development of [[room_temperature_superconductors | room temperature]] superconductors could usher in a new era for humankind, significantly impacting various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:55">[01:57:55]</a>.

### Energy Storage and Transmission
Superconductors could revolutionize energy infrastructure by enabling lossless energy storage and transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   **Infinite Batteries**: With zero resistance, electricity could circulate indefinitely within a superconducting loop, effectively creating "infinite batteries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. This would address the primary challenge of inconsistent energy production from renewable sources by allowing efficient storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.
*   **Lossless Power Grids**: Superconducting power cables would eliminate energy loss during transmission, leading to highly efficient and sustainable power grids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

### Magnetic Levitation and Transportation
The [[meissner_effect_and_levitation | Meissner effect]] allows superconductors to repel magnetic fields, enabling levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.
*   **Levitating Vehicles**: This property could lead to magnetic levitating cars and trains (maglev trains) that float above tracks, reducing friction and allowing for unprecedented speeds and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.
*   **Controllable Levitation**: The prospect of an "interesting controllable levitation phenomenon" suggests dynamic and precise control over levitating objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:39">[01:36:39]</a>.

### Advanced Computing
Superconductors are crucial for certain types of advanced computing.
*   [[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum Computing]]: Many [[quantum_computing_advancements | qubits]] (the basic units of [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]]) currently require extremely low temperatures to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. A [[room_temperature_superconductors | room temperature]] superconductor would enable [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] to operate without massive, complex cooling systems, making them smaller, cheaper, and more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This could lead to:
    *   **Faster and More Powerful Computers**: Simulating chemistry and other complex interactions becomes far more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
    *   **Revolutionary AI Training**: [[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum computers]] could potentially "instantly get to the answer" for machine learning model optimization, as opposed to current iterative training methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>.

### Medical Devices
Superconductors are already used in medical imaging, but [[room_temperature_superconductors | room temperature]] versions would improve accessibility.
*   **Enhanced MRI Scanners**: Superconducting magnets are essential for MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines, generating powerful magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. With [[room_temperature_superconductors | room temperature]] materials, these machines could become "cheaper, smaller, and more energy efficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>, potentially allowing for handheld MRIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.

### Scientific Research and Other Applications
*   **Particle Accelerators**: Superconductors could improve devices like the Large Hadron Collider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   **Terahertz Antennas**: A specific type of advanced antenna is mentioned as a potential application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52">[01:39:52]</a>.
*   **Solving Physics Puzzles**: The material could help researchers understand fundamental aspects of superconductivity and its coexistence with magnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:52">[01:36:52]</a>.

[!NOTE] **Impact on Daily Life**: If these [[room_temperature_superconductors | room temperature]] materials are scalable and manufacturable using common elements, every future electrical circuit could potentially incorporate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This contrasts with earlier superconductors that required extreme conditions like high pressure or extremely low temperatures, or rare earth elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The fact that the materials are readily available (lead, copper, phosphide, sulfate) and the synthesis process relatively simple (mortar and pestle, then baking in a vacuum furnace) suggests high potential for widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:42">[01:43:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

From: [[hu-po]] <br/> 

Human preference learning for [[text_to_3d_content_generation | text-to-3D content generation]] is a framework designed to improve the alignment of generated 3D models with human aesthetic and semantic preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. While existing [[text_to_3d_content_generation | text-to-3D]] methods can generate diverse 3D results, they often fail to align well with what humans actually prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This approach addresses the "deviant distribution" problem, where the conditional distributions of pre-trained [[diffusion_models_for_3D_reconstruction | diffusion models]] diverge from human preferences and user prompt distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## The Dream Reward Framework

The "Dream Reward" framework is a comprehensive system that learns and improves 3D models based on human feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. It leverages a dataset of human comparisons to train a reward model that quantifies human preferences.

### Data Collection

A key component of Dream Reward is the creation of a human preference dataset. This involves:
*   Collecting 25,000 expert comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   Utilizing a systematic annotation pipeline, including rating and ranking of generated 3D models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   This dataset is used to build "Reward 3D," which is described as the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference reward model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

### Training the Reward Model

The collected human preferences are used to train a reward model (`R_theta`) in a supervised learning setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   Input: Multiview images of a generated 3D object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   Output: Scores related to alignment, fidelity, and consistency, reflecting human judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   The model learns to effectively encode human preferences, despite challenges like rapid convergence and overfitting during training, which can be mitigated by freezing certain [[transformer_models_in_3d_reconstruction | Transformer]] layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### Optimizing 3D Generation

Once the reward model is trained, it's used to fine-tune a [[multiview_diffusion_models | multiview diffusion model]], typically a [[transformer_models_in_3d_reconstruction | Transformer]]-based [[diffusion_models_for_3D_reconstruction | diffusion model]] or a [[nerf_models_for_3d_reconstruction | NeRF]]-based model, for [[text_to_3d_content_generation | 3D generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   The process involves taking a text prompt, generating multiview images, and feeding these into the frozen reward model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   The reward model's output (the "reward") is then combined with standard Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   This combined loss function pushes gradients back into the [[nerf_models_for_3d_reconstruction | NeRF]]'s representation, encouraging the model to generate 3D assets that not only look good (via SDS) but also align with human subjective preferences (via the reward loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** A significant challenge is tuning the hyperparameter that balances the weight between the SDS loss and the reward loss. This balance determines how much the model prioritizes reconstruction accuracy versus human preference alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Computational Cost:** Fine-tuning [[diffusion_models_for_3D_reconstruction | diffusion models]] for 3D generation is computationally intensive, often requiring hundreds or even thousands of steps, significantly more than 2D tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Data Bias:** Many existing 3D datasets, like Objaverse, suffer from an "object-centric bias," making it difficult to generate scenes with multiple interacting objects or complex compositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Human preference learning can help mitigate these biases.
*   **Future of Generative 3D:** The future of generative 3D models is expected to incorporate human feedback as a crucial component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This will lead to models that not only produce high-quality, consistent 3D content but also significantly boost prompt alignment with human intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often used in [[use_of_large_language_models_in_robotics | Large Language Models]], will likely become standard in 3D generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

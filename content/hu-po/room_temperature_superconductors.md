A [[superconductor_applications | superconductor]] is a material that can conduct electricity with zero resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00"></a>. Unlike conventional conductors such as copper, which exhibit some resistance when electricity passes through them, superconductors allow current to flow indefinitely without energy loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00"></a>. Resistors in circuits, for instance, are essentially very long wires designed to create resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00"></a>.

Historically, [[superconductor_applications | superconductors]] have been created, but they typically require extremely low temperatures, often near absolute zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00"></a>. Some have achieved room temperature superconductivity but only under tremendously high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00"></a>. A common demonstration of superconductivity is the [[meissner_effect_and_levitation | Meisner effect]], where a superconductor levitates above a magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00"></a>. However, such demonstrations usually involve supercooling the material in substances like liquid nitrogen, as the effect is lost once it heats up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00"></a>. Until recently, no one had achieved superconductivity at both room temperature and ambient pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00"></a>.

## LK-99: A Novel Discovery

A recent paper, "First room temperature ambient pressure superconductor," introduces LK-99, a modified lead-apatite structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00"></a>. It claims to be the first material to exhibit superconductivity at room temperature (above 400K or 127°C) and ambient pressure (one atmosphere) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00"></a>.

### Properties and Mechanism
LK-99 demonstrates:
*   Zero resistivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00"></a>.
*   A critical current (the maximum current it can carry while remaining superconductive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00"></a>.
*   A critical magnetic field (the maximum magnetic field it can withstand while remaining superconductive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00"></a>.
*   The [[meissner_effect_and_levitation | Meisner effect]], allowing it to levitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00"></a>.

The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from a minute structural distortion and slight volume shrinkage within its lead-apatite lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00"></a>. This distortion is caused by substituting a small copper ion (Cu) for a larger lead ion (Pb) in the material's insulating network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00"></a>. Lead (Pb, atomic number 82, atomic radius 147) is significantly larger than copper (Cu, atomic number 29, atomic radius 138) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00"></a>. This substitution generates internal stress, akin to the stress typically applied via extreme temperature or pressure to achieve superconductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00"></a>.

The crystal structure of LK-99 is hexagonal, with "cylindrical columns" arranged at intervals of about 0.65 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00"></a>. The substitution causes the internal lead atoms to slightly shift within the crystal's a-axis plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00"></a>. This rearrangement creates "superconducting quantum wells" (SQWs) within the material, tiny confined spaces where electrons can move together without resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51"></a>. Electrons in LK-99 are believed to travel through these SQWs via a quantum tunneling process, coherently moving in three dimensions across multiple wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:08"></a>.

### Synthesis of LK-99
The synthesis process for LK-99 is surprisingly straightforward, involving common elements:
1.  **Preparation**: Lanarkite (lead sulfate) and copper phosphide are uniformly mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio using an agate mortar and pestle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02"></a>.
2.  **Reaction**: The mixture is sealed in a reaction tube under vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:56"></a>.
3.  **Baking**: It is then reacted at 925°C for 10 hours, like "slow cooking ribs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:44"></a>.
4.  **Formation**: A dark gray ingot is reproducibly obtained, which can be shaped into thin cuboids for measurements or pulverized into powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12"></a>.

The relative simplicity of the materials and process has led to excitement, as previously discovered room temperature superconductors often involved rare earth elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00"></a>. The core concept of inducing stress via internal structural changes, rather than external factors like extreme cold or pressure, is a key advancement in [[material_science_in_superconductors | material science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:13"></a>.

### Reproducibility and Future Research
As with any groundbreaking scientific claim, reproducibility is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00"></a>. Scientists worldwide are working to replicate the LK-99 results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:56"></a>. The research was supported by government grants from the National Research Foundation of Korea and the Ministry of Education, suggesting it may remain in the public domain and not be restricted by patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:27"></a>.

Historically, early superconducting research in the 1900s also explored lead-based materials. After decades of exploring complex elements for superconductors, the discovery of LK-99 brings research back to lead, suggesting a full circle in the search for practical superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43"></a>.

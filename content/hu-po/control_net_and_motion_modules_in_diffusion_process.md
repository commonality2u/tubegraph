The [[animatediff_framework_for_animating_diffusion_models | AnimateDiff]] framework proposes a practical solution to animate most existing personalized text-to-image models, saving efforts in model-specific tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The core of this framework involves inserting a newly initialized motion modeling module into frozen text-to-image models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, which is then trained on video clips to distill "reasonable motion priors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Once trained, this module can be injected into personalized models derived from the same base text-to-image ([[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | T2i]]) [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | diffusion model]] to generate temporally smooth animation clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

Text-to-image [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | generative models]] have gained significant attention for their high visual quality and text-driven controllability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Key developments include:
*   **Glide:** Introduced text conditions to [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | diffusion models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **DALL-E 2:** An original OpenAI [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | diffusion model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Stable Diffusion:** A widely used [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | T2i model]] based on the latent [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | diffusion model]] (LDM), which performs the denoising process in the latent space of an autoencoder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This approach reduces computational resources while maintaining image quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

### Working Principle of Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) consisting of an encoder (E) and a decoder (D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. An input image `X_0` is first mapped to a latent space `Z_0` by the encoder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. This latent representation is then perturbed by a predefined Markov process, iteratively adding noise over a series of time steps (`T`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. The model uses a U-Net architecture to predict and remove noise at each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. Text conditioning is integrated into this process, guiding the image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. The text encoder, typically a pre-trained CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder, converts text prompts into numerical vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

## Personalization Techniques for Diffusion Models

Personalized [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | image generation]] allows users to introduce new concepts or styles into pre-trained models at a low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Two prominent methods are:
*   **DreamBooth:** Fine-tunes the entire network on a small dataset (e.g., 3-5 images) using a rare string as an indicator for the target domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Regularization images are used to prevent catastrophic forgetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.
*   **Laura (Low-Rank Adaptation):** A more efficient approach that fine-tunes only the model's weights residuals (Delta W) using low-rank matrices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. This significantly reduces training and storage costs compared to DreamBooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. An important hyperparameter is the `Alpha` value, which controls the tuning's impact on original model weights, helping to avoid overfitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

Current personalized [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | T2i models]] primarily produce static images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The challenge lies in extending these models to create animations while preserving their specific domain knowledge and quality without expensive [[hyperparameter_tuning | hyperparameter tuning]] or collecting personalized video data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

## The AnimateDiff Framework

[[animatediff_framework_for_animating_diffusion_models | AnimateDiff]] aims to turn personalized [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | T2i models]] into animation generators with minimal additional training cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

### Motion Modeling Module Design

At its core, [[animatediff_framework_for_animating_diffusion_models | AnimateDiff]] introduces a motion modeling module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This module is inserted into the [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | diffusion model's]] U-Net structure at every resolution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

*   **Structure:** The motion module consists of vanilla temporal [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformers]] with self-attention blocks operating along the temporal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. This allows the module to efficiently exchange information and capture temporal dependencies across frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.
*   **Input Reshaping:** To handle video input (a 5D tensor of batch x channels x frames x height x width), the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature map are reshaped into the batch dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. This allows the network to process each frame independently while the motion module operates across frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This reshaping also enables the module to generalize to higher resolutions despite being trained on a specific size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.
*   **Zero Initialization:** Inspired by [[conditional_diffusion_model_for_neural_networks | ControlNet]], the output projection layer of the temporal Transformer is zero-initialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. This ensures that, at the beginning of training, the newly added motion module does not interfere with the already well-performing pre-trained [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | image model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.
*   **Positional Encodings:** Sinusoidal position encodings are added to the self-attention blocks, allowing the network to be aware of the temporal location of the current frame within the animation clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.

### Training Process

The training process for the motion module is similar to that of the latent [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | diffusion model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.
*   **Data:** The module is trained on the WebVid 10M dataset, which consists of realistic video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. Video clips are sampled at a stride of four frames and then resized and center-cropped to 256x256 pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. The final length of video clips for training is set to 16 frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.
*   **Frozen Base Model:** Crucially, the pre-trained weights of the base [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | T2i model]] (e.g., Stable Diffusion V1) remain frozen during optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. This preserves the model's existing feature space and domain knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Loss Function:** The motion module is trained using an L2 loss term, predicting the noise strength added to the latent codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Noise Schedule:** A slightly modified linear beta schedule is used for the diffusion process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. This adaptation helps the model better adapt to new tasks and data distributions, achieving a balance of visual quality and motion smoothness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>.

### Generalizability and Limitations

The trained motion module can be inserted into any personalized [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | T2i model]] (e.g., DreamBooth or Laura checkpoints) without further specific tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This is because personalization scarcely modifies the base model's feature space, similar to observations in [[conditional_diffusion_model_for_neural_networks | ControlNet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

[[animatediff_framework_for_animating_diffusion_models | AnimateDiff]] demonstrates the ability to distinguish major subjects from foreground and background, creating a sense of vividness and realism in animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>.

However, the approach has limitations:
*   **Domain Gap:** Most failure cases occur when the personalized [[Diffusion Models and ControlNet | T2i model's]] domain is far from realistic (e.g., 2D Disney cartoons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>. This is attributed to the large distribution gap between the realistic training videos and the personalized model's domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>. A potential solution, proposed for future work, is to fine-tune the motion module on videos specific to the target domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:16">[01:44:16]</a>.
*   **Video Length:** The use of temporal [[Transformer architecture in diffusion models | Transformers]], which have quadratic memory usage with respect to sequence length, limits the current framework to very short video clips (e.g., 16 frames) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. Extending to longer videos would become computationally expensive and impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control:** The generated animations are not explicitly controllable beyond the initial text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>. Future work could explore conditioning the motion module on additional signals, such as text descriptions of desired motion or reference videos, to provide more granular control over the animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

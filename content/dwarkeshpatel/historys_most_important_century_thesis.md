The idea of the "Most Important Century" is a hypothesis that suggests the current century could be the most pivotal in human history due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential transformative impact. This notion was discussed by Holden Karnofsky, co-CEO of Open Philanthropy, during his conversation about global development and the future of humanity. Here, we summarize the key points of this intriguing thesis as elaborated by Karnofsky.

## Genesis of the Thesis

Holden Karnofsky's journey toward the Most Important Century thesis began with his professional specialization in identifying underappreciated but crucial ideas that can yield an outsized return on investment. This led him to engage with the Effective Altruist Community and absorb the idea that advancements in AI could potentially make this century the most crucial in human history [[effective_altruism_and_longterm_impacts]].

## The Concept

The basic premise of the Most Important Century thesis is that if humanity develops the right kind of AI systems this century, it could lead to unparalleled economic growth and technological advancements [[ai_and_economic_growth]]. Specifically, AI systems capable of performing all key tasks that humans undertake to advance science and technology could result in explosive and transformative progress [[future_capabilities_and_progress_of_ai_models]].

## Economic Growth Trajectory

Historically, economic growth has been accelerating, with the rate of technological advancement climbing sharply over recent centuries [[technology_and_economic_growth_in_history]]. This growth trend is driven by a self-reinforcing feedback loop where more people lead to more ideas, increasing resources, and further population growth. However, Karnofsky notes that a break in this loop occurred when societies became wealthier without accelerating population growth [[impact_of_historical_and_cultural_factors_on_development]]. AI could potentially reestablish this loop by autonomously driving innovation and economic growth, potentially achieving what Karnofsky describes as "infinite growth" [[ai_scaling_and_its_effectiveness]].

## The Role of AI

AI's potential to recreate the economic feedback loop hinges on its ability to carry out all tasks humans currently perform in science and technology advancement. Achieving this would not just automate innovation but also vastly accelerate it, leading to unprecedented changes in the world scenario in a relatively short time [[ai_scaling_and_longterm_predictions]]. Karnofsky argues that it is more than likely — at over a 50% chance — that transformative AI will be developed this century [[challenges_and_considerations_for_achieving_agi]].

## Implications for Humanity

The profound transformations envisaged by the thesis suggest that if AI advances as anticipated, we could witness what Karnofsky describes as "thousands of years of changes packed into a much shorter time period," potentially resulting in a future deeply distinct from the present [[potential_societal_impacts_of_advanced_ai]]. This new world could be characterized by vast technological capabilities, a fundamental shift in societal structures, and a post-human civilization with stable, sustainable, and potentially unrecognizable characteristics [[implications_of_superintelligence]].

## Challenges and Responsibilities

One of the core tenets of the Most Important Century thesis involves the responsibilities that come with such transformative potential. Karnofsky underscores the critical nature of shaping this transition responsibly. He stresses the need for caution in AI development to avoid catastrophic outcomes, such as AI systems developing unintended goals with disastrous consequences [[ai_safety_and_security_measures]]. This responsibility is crucial, given the potential for AI to drastically alter power dynamics and societal norms [[alignment_and_misalignment_of_ai]].

## Conclusion

The Most Important Century thesis posits that AI could make the current century a pivotal period in human history. As society approaches this potential inflection point, the hypothesis serves as a call to action for the careful stewardship of AI technologies and a reminder of the profound responsibilities shouldered by present and future generations [[the_future_of_ai_research_and_potential_societal_impacts]].

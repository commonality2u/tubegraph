## Goals

Architect is keen on addressing existing inefficiencies in the digital trading infrastructures, aiming to be at the forefront of market innovation, not just for cryptocurrencies but potentially for equities and other asset classes in the future.

### Short-term Objectives

- **Deploying Advanced Trading Infrastructure**: To provide immediate solutions for accessing and managing trades across diverse platforms, Architect focuses on establishing a robust infrastructure that meets the complex needs of all trader levels.

Achieving [[artificial_intelligence_and_general_intelligence | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]] remains one of the most ambitious goals in the field of artificial intelligence. This article discusses some of the core challenges as outlined by François Chollet, creator of Keras, and other experts during a dialogue on the subject. AGI implies a system that can learn and adapt to any task much like a human, fundamentally differing from specialized AI that thrives on memorization of data.

## Memorization vs. Intelligence

One of the principal challenges in achieving AGI is differentiating between mere memorization and true intelligence. Current Language Learning Models (LLMs) largely rely on memorizing vast amounts of data, which doesn't equate to intelligence. While these models can solve a host of memorization-based benchmarks effectively, they struggle when faced with novel tasks that require on-the-fly problem-solving and reasoning [[limitations_of_large_language_models_in_solving_novel_tasks | Limitations of large language models in solving novel tasks]]. Chollet points out that intelligence involves the ability to adapt to new situations, a capacity not possessed by current models that lack true program synthesis.

> ARC, a benchmark designed by François Chollet, aims to distinguish between memorization and intelligence by presenting novel problems resistant to memorization. These tasks require only core knowledge, such as basic physics and counting, which any child can understand, yet challenge current AI models significantly [[understanding_arc_benchmarks_and_its_significance | Understanding ARC benchmarks and its significance]].

## Novelty and Adaptation

Chollet emphasizes that true intelligence involves adapting to novelty. In real life, situations are constantly changing, and relying solely on pre-trained information isn't sufficient [[pretraining_vs_posttraining_in_ai | Pre-training vs Post-training in AI]]. For AGI to be truly beneficial, it must have the ability to learn and adapt to unforeseen tasks and scenarios effectively. The difference between skill and intelligence is profound; while skill can be scaled and applied to specific tasks, general intelligence is about acquiring those skills quickly with minimal input data.

## Program Synthesis as a Key Component

Another core aspect is the ability of an AI model to perform on-the-fly program synthesis, combining learned concepts to solve novel problems in real time [[comparison_between_human_intelligence_and_ai_learning_techniques | Comparison between human intelligence and AI learning techniques]]. Current models primarily fetch solutions from a memorized bank of possible answers, which lacks the adaptability seen in human problem-solving. Chollet argues for a future where AI learns through discrete program synthesis, merging it with deep learning to create systems capable of reasoning and providing intuitive suggestions [[future_capabilities_and_progress_of_ai_models | Future capabilities and progress of AI models]].

> Discrete program search models excel in novel problem-solving by using combinatorial search to construct solutions from basic building blocks. This method is contrasted with the data inefficiency of gradient descent used in deep learning [[ai_scaling_and_its_effectiveness | AI scaling and its effectiveness]].

## Open Research and Innovation

A significant contemporary issue is the restriction of open research, which can impede progress towards true AGI. The closing of frontier research and withholding of technical details in publications may stall the development of groundbreaking ideas needed to solve AGI challenges [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_and_agi_development | Challenges and opportunities in AI and AGI development]]. The progress towards AGI necessitates a collaborative, open-innovation approach to leverage diverse insights into synthesis of novel AI capabilities [[the_impact_and_future_of_opensource_software | Open-source versus closed-source AI models]].

To move closer to AGI, new ideas and hybrid systems that combine memorization and genuine reasoning capabilities are needed. The implementation of challenges like the ARC prize encourages exploration into the boundaries of today's AI capabilities, prompting innovation towards the goal of AGI.

In a discussion with Professor Alex Tabarrok, an economics professor at George Mason University, the topic of dominant assurance contracts emerged as a novel solution to the classic public goods problem. This article explores what dominant assurance contracts are, their potential applications, and their implications for public goods provisioning.

## Understanding Public Goods

Public goods are characterized by their non-rivalrous and non-excludable nature, meaning they can be consumed by many people simultaneously without diminishing their value and it is difficult to prevent anyone from consuming them. Examples include clean air, national defense, and lighthouses. The challenge with public goods is the free-rider problem, where individuals have an incentive to withhold their contribution in hopes that others will cover the cost. This leads to under-provisioning of such goods. This is similar to the [[impact_of_ai_on_future_economic_growth | economic and societal impact]] observed in AI integration, where collective actions can accelerate growth when well-coordinated.

## The Concept of Assurance Contracts

An assurance contract is a mechanism where participants pledge to fund a public good, but no money changes hands unless the total pledges meet a predetermined threshold. This mechanism ensures that an individualâ€™s contribution is only collected when the public good is sufficiently funded to ensure its provision.

## Introduction of Dominant Assurance Contracts

Professor Tabarrok introduced an innovative twist to assurance contracts called "dominant assurance contracts." In this variation, participants who pledge to contribute not only retract their pledge if the funding threshold is not met, but they also receive a refund bonus. This bonus incentivizes participation because individuals benefit whether the public good is funded or not. According to Tabarrok:

> "If the project is not successful, if not enough other people contribute, then I [want to] contribute because I'll get the refund bonus and I won't have to do anything" (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>).

## Practical Application and Experiments

Dominant assurance contracts are particularly useful for local public goods where the optimal size of the good can be estimated, such as a local bridge or sports facility. They simplify the contribution problem, encouraging more individuals to engage in funding these projects. In experimental laboratory settings, Tabarrok and his colleagues found that dominant assurance contracts can double the number of successful funded projects compared to traditional assurance markets (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>).

For instance, in platforms like Kickstarter, this mechanism could enhance the success rate by encouraging broader participation with the added financial incentive of a refund bonus, similar to how [[investment_irrationality_and_animal_spirits | investment behaviors]] are driven by additional incentives for stakeholders.

## Implications for Public Goods Provision

Dominant assurance contracts present a promising method for solving the traditional issue of public goods under-provisioning. By aligning individual incentives with the collective goal of funding public goods, they encourage participation and increase the likelihood that worthwhile projects receive funding.

As such, dominant assurance contracts could shift the landscape of public choice towards more efficient and voluntary mechanisms for funding public goods, furthering the potential for community-driven projects without the need for government intervention. In an era of digital transactions and platforms, these theoretical frameworks offer real-world applications, demonstrating the power of innovative economic ideas in addressing age-old challenges. This mirrors the [[role_of_ai_in_future_economic_growth | role of AI in future economic growth]], where aligning incentives can drive substantial advancements.

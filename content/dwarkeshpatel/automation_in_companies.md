Automation within companies is a rapidly evolving trend that is impacting businesses at all levels. In a recent discussion, Gwern Branwen, a well-respected researcher and writer, shared his insights on whether companies are more likely to automate processes from the top-down, starting with CEOs, or from the bottom-up, starting with workers.

## Bottom-Up Automation: The Predominant Path

According to Branwen, the pressures and current trends strongly favor a bottom-up approach to automation. He argues that automating at the worker level before moving upwards through management levels is more palatable and seemingly more feasible. In Branwen's words, "All of the pressures are to go bottom-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

From an organizational perspective, this method allows for a gradual integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation into a business model. Human executives may eventually oversee firms predominantly run by AI, with these executives focusing on long-term strategic vision that AI may lack due to its myopic nature [[challenges_in_achieving_artificial_general_intelligence | due to its myopic nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## The Role of Human Leadership

Branwen indicates that humans still excel in long-term vision, creativity, and strategic thinking, areas where AI might falter due to its often myopic tendencies. He posits that a human CEO might retain the role of visionary, with AI supporting by executing strategic plans and bringing new proposals. This human-led approach could keep AI-based companies competitive by compensating for AI's lack of creativity and strategic foresight [[comparison_between_human_intelligence_and_ai_learning_techniques | strategic foresight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Implications of Automation Strategies

Implementing automation in a bottom-up manner has critical implications. Organizations might see automated processes handling routine tasks while humans remain engaged in roles requiring complex decision-making and innovation, thus creating a balanced ecosystem where AI and human roles complement each other effectively.

Branwen also suggests that this approach could lead to a paradigm where human-led firms outcompete entirely AI-driven firms, as the latter may make more short-sighted decisions that do not align with long-term business objectives [[ai_progress_forecasting | long-term business objectives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

In conclusion, while the idea of top-down automation can seem attractive in notion—streamlining decision-making from the CEO downward—Branwen's insights stress the practicality and strategic benefit of adopting a bottom-up automation approach, leveraging human creativity and foresight to guide and complement automated systems.

Georgism, named after the 19th-century economist Henry George, is an economic theory proposing a particular approach to taxation and property rights. This theory focuses on the taxation of land value, arguing for a fundamental shift in how societies view and manage land resources. The concept has gained renewed interest as a mechanism to resolve some of the persistent issues in modern economies, such as inequality and housing crises [[economic_disparities_and_labor_markets | and economic disparities]].

## Introduction to Georgism

Georgism originates from the philosophies of Henry George, who posited that land plays an underrated yet critical role in economies (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>). He argued that the unearned income generated from land, which owes its value to its location and surrounding development, should be shared among the public rather than be considered private wealth.

> Henry George's central argument is captured in the adage "land is the one thing they're not making any more of." This highlights the finite nature of land and its intrinsic value owing to location and human proximity (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>).

## What Is a Land Value Tax?

The main policy proposal of Georgism is the implementation of a Land Value Tax (LVT). This is a levy on the unimproved value of land, excluding any buildings or infrastructure added by humans. The idea is to tax landowners on the natural value of their land which arises from communal development and inherent geographical desirability, rather than individual improvements (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>).

### The Mechanism

The LVT aims to deter land speculation, which can lead to inefficient land use and monopolization [[economic_impact_of_land_speculation | due to speculative practices]]. By taxing the unimproved value of land, Georgism seeks to encourage the productive use of land and curtail speculative price inflation (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>).

### Economic Implications

1. **Incentivizing Use of Land**: Under an LVT, holding land without utilizing it would incur costs, contrary to the current situation where land speculators can profit by merely owning land in high-demand areas (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>).

2. **Reduction of Inequality**: By redistributing the income derived from land, Georgism aims to address wealth disparities, which are exacerbated by the concentration of land ownership (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:04">[02:23:04]</a>).

3. **Financing Public Goods**: Revenue from LVT can fund essential services and infrastructural improvements, thus enhancing public welfare without deterring productive economic activities (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>).

## Empirical Examples and Critiques

Historically, different regions have experimented with variants of a land tax. Norwegian policy on oil extraction serves as a model, employing a high severance tax to capture the rents from natural resources, with revenues used for public benefit [[strategic_importance_of_energy_resources_in_warfare | in various strategic aspects]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>).

### Criticism and Challenges

1. **Assessment of Land Value**: A common challenge is the precise assessment of land value separate from improvements. Innovations in mass appraisal technology are pivotal in addressing this concern to implement a fair and effective LVT (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>).

2. **Transitional Issues**: Implementing such a tax system must carefully manage the transition to avoid adverse effects on current landowners who operate within existing legal frameworks [[political_feasibility_of_implementing_georgism | and consider political feasibility]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>).

## Conclusion

The renewed interest in Georgism and the potential implementation of a Land Value Tax offer a promising avenue for addressing some of the systemic issues modern economies face, from housing shortages to rising inequality [[housing_markets_and_regulation | amidst current housing market regulations]]. While challenges remain in assessments and political feasibility, advancements in appraisal technologies and growing discussions on inequality provide a conducive environment for these ideas to progress.

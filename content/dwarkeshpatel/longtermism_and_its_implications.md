Longtermism is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the importance of positively influencing the long-term future. During a conversation with William MacAskill, a philosopher and one of the founders of the [[effective_altruism_movement | effective altruism movement]], various dimensions of longtermism were discussed, exploring its relevance and implications for contemporary and future society.

## Understanding Longtermism

The basic premise of longtermism is to prioritize actions that have the greatest long-term impact on the future. MacAskill argues that we should focus not only on immediate outcomes but on what will hold significance for the far future. One of the critical areas often highlighted in discussions of longtermism involves contemplating which values and beliefs society should strive to uphold in the long run.

This line of thought suggests that societal norms, ethics, and technological advancements should be carefully considered to avoid locking in values prematurely without adequate reasoning and empathy [[moral_progress_and_contingency_of_values | moral contingency]].

## Moral Progress and Historical Contingency

In the podcast, MacAskill mentions that moral progress is not a linear path but is frequently subject to historical contingencies. He stops to consider what modern Western values might indicate about human progress and suggests that there is significant room for improvement.

One could argue that if different regions had undergone industrial revolutions, the dominant ethics and practices today might differ greatly. For example, industrialization in India instead of Western Europe might have prevented widespread factory farming, a practice viewed by some as a considerable moral failing [[impact_of_historical_and_cultural_factors_on_development | historical impact]].

## The Long Reflection

MacAskill introduces the notion of a "long reflection," which emphasizes the societal duty to deeply consider which values we should uphold in perpetuity before making irreversible choices. Such a reflection period aims to guide humanity using reason, empathy, and debate rather than whims or transient success.

## Implications for Policy and Society

Implementing longtermist principles in policy involves setting up structures that can offer adequate representation to future generations. This idea, however, grapples with [[challenges_in_representing_future_generations | challenges]] of gaming by current stakeholders due to their inability to speak for themselves.

Regulating technological development and addressing societal risks are also part of the longtermist agenda. These include effectively handling artificial intelligence and catastrophic biological threats [[ai_safety_and_security_measures | AI safety]], as well as managing the moral and ethical dimensions of these technologies [[ai_ethics_and_deployment_strategies | AI ethics]].

## Conclusion

Longtermism challenges society to think beyond immediate outcomes and consider actions that ensure a favorable future. It inspires a broader discourse on how we should govern and regulate technological and moral progress with a keen eye on how they shape the distant future. As William MacAskill articulates, the importance is not in asking which values and practices should just win today but in understanding and ensuring that they are the right ones for tomorrowâ€”before they become irrevocably entangled with our identity as a civilization.

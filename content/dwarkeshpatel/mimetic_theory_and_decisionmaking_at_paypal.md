Mimetic theory, a concept introduced by French thinker René Girard, explores the idea that human behavior and desires are largely imitative. The notion that competition stems from imitating others' desires is a foundational element of this theory. In the podcast interview with Jimmy Soni, author of "The Founders: The Story of Paypal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley," this concept is given context in the environment of Paypal, proving crucial to understanding key decision-making moments of the company.

## The Role of Mimetic Competition

One of the key examples of mimetic competition discussed is the rivalry between Confinity (which eventually became Paypal) and x.com, another payment service created by Elon Musk. Both companies were engaged in a costly arms race of bonuses to attract users, akin to a competition without sustainable boundaries. Peter Thiel, a central figure at Paypal, recognized that this competition was destructive rather than productive, illustrating a core aspect of mimetic theory where competition can lead to ruin rather than success [[ai_development_and_competition_globally | globally]].

## Contrarian Decision-Making

Peter Thiel, influenced by his knowledge of Girard's theories, recognized the power of contrarian thinking in decision-making. During moments when the market was dominated by a single trend or expectation, Thiel's willingness to zig while others zagged was profoundly strategic. A quintessential example occurred post-9/11 when Thiel decided to go public when no one else would, reasoning that this was the moment to act against the herd [[economic_impact_of_ai_and_automation_on_global_growth | against global trends]]. This decision aligns with a Girardian view of challenging collective mimetic behavior to foster unique opportunities.

## Thematic Elements of Mimetic Desire

The themes of mimicry do not end with competition. Thiel's hiring practices at Paypal are reflective of an understanding that breaks from traditional competition for the "best" talent based on surface-level qualifications like age or experience. For instance, despite board objections, Thiel saw potential in young Roloff Botha, promoting him to a key financial position based on capability rather than convention [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_ai_in_society | societal norms]].

He similarly appointed Reid Hoffman as COO against common wisdom because he valued the skills Hoffman brought to the table that countered traditional expectations. These decisions underscore the subtleties of mimesis influencing roles and responsibilities within the company beyond mere competition [[ai_in_business_and_consumer_applications | within businesses]].

## Girardian Influence in Financial Strategy

Thiel’s grasp of mimetic impulses was not confined to internal organizational matters but extended to broader financial strategies. He recognized before the dot-com bust that securing capital was crucial, urging the company to complete its fundraising rapidly [[financial_systems_and_market_cap_analysis | through market strategies]]. This foresight was underscored by understanding how mimetic behavior could lead to rapid shifts in market sentiment, thereby guiding strategic fundraising and preemptive actions [[perm_economics_of_growing_up_in_india_and_impact_of_demographics_and_policy_on_growth | in emerging markets]].

## Conclusion

In revisiting Paypal’s early days via Jimmy Soni's narrative, mimetic theory emerges not merely as an academic curiosity but a practical lens that influenced the decisions of its founders, particularly Peter Thiel. By understanding and sometimes opposing the mimetic competition, contrarian strategic decisions were made that significantly impacted Paypal's trajectory. This interplay of Girardian thought and effective decision-making highlights the importance of deep theoretical insights in navigating and shaping the complex environment of Silicon Valley startups [[role_of_memory_in_learning | by leveraging learnings]].

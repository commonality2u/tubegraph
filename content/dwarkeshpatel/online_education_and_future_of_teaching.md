In a world where technological advances continue to reshape industries, education is no exception. Professor Alex Tabarrok from George Mason University provides insights into how online education is evolving and its potential impacts on the teaching profession.

## The Emergence of Online Education

Online education has started to gain traction as a viable alternative or supplement to traditional, in-person education. Platforms such as the Marginal Revolution University, co-founded by Tabarrok, demonstrate the potential for online courses to extend the reach of education, allowing instructors to teach thousands of students globally [[ai_and_economic_growth | potential societal impacts of advanced AI]].

### Benefits of Online Education

- **Scalability**: Unlike traditional education, where a professor is limited to a classroom of students, online platforms can reach hundreds of thousands worldwide [[ai_scaling_and_its_effectiveness]].
- **Flexibility for Users**: Students have the opportunity to learn at their own pace, pause, and replay lessons as needed, providing a customizable learning experience [[ai_driven_personalization_and_applications]].

## The Transformation of Teaching

With the rise of massive open online courses (MOOCs), the teaching landscape is expected to transform significantly. The shift is likely to see a decrease in traditional teaching roles as educational technology emphasizes selecting the best educators to reach broader audiences [[role_of_memory_in_learning]].

### Fewer, More Influential Teachers

- The future might resemble professions like sports, where top performers receive compensation akin to famous athletes but are fewer in number [[economic_disparities_and_labor_markets]].
- These top educators could teach global audiences through online platforms, outperforming traditional one-on-one educational models in terms of reach and impact.

## The Evolution of Educational Roles

While the role of traditional classroom teachers may diminish, new roles will emerge:

- **Tutors and Coaches**: Personal coaches or tutors could benefit those looking for individualized guidance as education becomes more scalable [[economic_and_social_impacts_of_ai]].
- **Design and Development**: There will be a growing need for individuals who can develop engaging and effective online educational materials [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_educational_innovation_and_technology]].

## Prospects for Online Education

Despite skepticism from past predictions about mediums like radio and television revolutionizing education, Tabarrok believes that technology has reached a threshold where education might be transformed [[impact_of_technology_on_government_and_policy]].

### Supporting Technologies

- Artificial intelligence is seen as pivotal in developing more effective educational tools, such as AI tutors that adapt to individual student needs [[potential_future_advancements_in_gene_editing_and_artificial_intelligence]].

## Conclusion

The future of education, driven by the expansion of online platforms and technological growth, offers opportunities for broader access and individualized learning experiences. While it may challenge traditional roles, it also provides avenues for innovation and creativity in teaching and learning [[cultural_and_historical_influences_on_modern_science]]. As educational institutions transition online, the potential for impactful education on a global scale grows exponentially.

Online education stands at the cusp of disrupting traditional pedagogies, potentially making learning more accessible and tailored to the needs of modern students worldwide [[the_future_of_ai_research_and_potential_societal_impacts]].

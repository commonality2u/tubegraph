Living under a totalitarian regime is an experience that profoundly impacts the psychology of those subjected to its pressures. In a recent interview with Jung Chang, acclaimed author of "Wild Swans" and "Mao: The Unknown Story", insights were shared about the psychological landscape experienced by individuals in China under [[maos_rise_to_power_in_china | Mao's rule]].

## Indoctrination and Brainwashing

Jung Chang discusses the omnipresent brainwashing that occurred under [[impact_of_maos_policies_on_china | Mao's regime]] from an early age. Children were taught to regard Mao as a god-like figure, with sayings like "I swear to Chairman Mao" becoming a staple in affirming the truth of statements [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07">[11:07]</a>]. This type of indoctrination created a psychological barrier, making it almost unthinkable to question [[communist_tactics_in_maintaining_power | Mao's leadership or policies]], despite the observable consequences of his governance.

## The Cult of Personality

Even in the face of personal tragedy and widespread societal suffering, questioning Mao was fraught with danger. The [[mao_zedong_and_the_cultural_revolution | cult of personality surrounding Mao]] was a constructed reality that demanded unwavering loyalty from the citizenry [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16">[11:16]</a>]. Chang explains that such regimes harness terror and societal control to suppress dissent, utilizing a mix of fear and reverence to maintain power.

## Isolation and Control

Chang emphasized the effects of societal isolation, as China was closed off from the outside world during this period. This insulation from alternative narratives ensured that questioning the status quo became inherently perilous [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55">[13:55]</a>]. Internally, political campaigns would frequently demand public self-criticism and denunciation, mechanisms designed to break and humiliate individuals, ensuring compliance [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00">[21:00]</a>].

## Social Fragmentation

The regime's tactics included the fragmentation of social bonds. For example, strong family ties were viewed as indicative of anti-state sentiment, labeled as ‘warm feelingism’, warning citizens against prioritizing familial love over love for Mao [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50">[24:50]</a>]. This psychological warfare stratified society, instilling mistrust among people and thus preventing organized opposition.

> The forced denunciations and self-criticisms fostered an environment where fear and mistrust permeated all aspects of life, contributing to a culture where even familial bonds were suspect.

## The Resultant Psyche

Living under these conditions naturally led to a state of constant psychological turmoil. Many people lived with an internalized fear of expressing dissent or even harboring unorthodox thoughts. Chang notes that this was not solely due to the propaganda but the systematic terror the regime was capable of inflicting.

The interview with Jung Chang highlights how these psychological impacts of totalitarian regimes are a tool used to consolidate and perpetuate power, leaving lasting effects on the minds and social structures of the individuals forced to endure them.

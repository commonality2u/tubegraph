Within the broader context of decision-making and future planning, the discussion around the roles of organizations and individuals in considering the long-term future offers intriguing insights into human behavior, evolution, and societal structures. Robin Hansen provides valuable perspectives on why certain entities tend to neglect, embrace, or struggle with the concept of planning for the distant future.

## The Individual and Discount Rates

### Evolutionary Context

Individuals inherently possess what's known as a "discount rate" â€” a concept that describes how much less value people place on future outcomes compared to immediate ones. This idea is grounded in evolutionary biology. Humans, like other biological organisms, have developed behaviors that prioritize immediate survival and reproduction within their environment [[human_evolutionary_biology_and_anthropology]]. Genes propagate by making decisions that ensure immediate continuation, and passing on half of their genetic material to offspring creates a natural bias favoring short-term benefits over uncertain long-term gains.

### Resource Utilization

Despite the tendency to prioritize the present, there's an argument for securing resources that transcend immediate needs. Investing in general resources can be beneficial without knowing precisely how the future will unfold. Resources remain valuable in an uncertain future [[concepts_of_agency_and_planning_in_ai]].

## Organizational Structures and Their Challenges

### Historical Perspective

Historically, organizations have been established as extensions of individuals and human societies to further special interests, including religious, corporate, and national ambitions. However, most organizations haven't evolved structures that prioritize the long view, often due to existing under the direct influence of immediate human objectives and interests [[the_role_of_kinship_and_social_organization_in_human_history]].

### Potential for Long-Term Strategy

The concept that organizations could evolve to sustain themselves by adopting long-term strategies is feasible. Organizations might eventually find ways to gather and utilize resources for self-promotion and longevity, independent of the immediate interests of individuals. However, this development has been limited because organizations are traditionally integrated within genotypic and individual goals rather than possessing independent motives [[the_role_and_future_of_venture_capital_in_tech]].

### Legal and Social Barriers

Legal systems have historically impeded efforts by organizations to firmly establish long-term resource gathering plans. Attempts to create legal constitutions that would force organizations to save resources for indefinite future use have often been undermined by legal reinterpretations that favor immediate redistribution [[challenges_in_achieving_artificial_general_intelligence]].

## Future Outlook for Long-Term Planning Units

### Evolutionary Agents

Hansen suggests that over time, evolutionary agents such as certain organizational structures might form which can successfully embody and execute long-term strategies. Such agents could bring about systematic changes by focusing on both resource acquisition and self-perpetuation [[evolutionary_perspectives_on_longterm_influence]].

### Challenges Ahead

Although it is hypothesized that these long-view agents will rise to prominence in the distant future, a compelling reason for concern remains in today's environment, where immediate priorities continue to dominate strategies and resource allocation [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_and_agi_development]].

The ability to transcend immediate interests could redefine organizational success and survival strategies, paving the way for a more stable and planned future landscape.

This exploration of individual and organizational roles in considering the long-term view elucidates the complex interplay between evolutionary tendencies, resource prioritization, and potential future shifts towards prolonged focus and strategies.

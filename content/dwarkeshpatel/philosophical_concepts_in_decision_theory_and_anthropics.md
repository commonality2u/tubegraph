Decision theory and anthropics delve into the fascinating intersection of ethics, logic, probability, and metaphysics. These disciplines are concerned with understanding how we make decisions and infer knowledge when confronted with uncertainty, especially when that uncertainty involves our own existence and consciousness. This article explains some of the key philosophical concepts in decision theory and anthropics, as discussed in the podcast episode featuring Joe Carl Smith, a research analyst at Open Philanthropy and philosophy doctoral student at the University of Oxford.

## Decision Theory: Concepts and Challenges

Decision theory is a framework for making rational choices, especially when outcomes are uncertain. Here, we explore some of the relevant philosophical ideas discussed by Joe Carl Smith:

### Evidential Decision Theory (EDT)

One of the decision theories that Carl Smith mentions is **Evidential Decision Theory (EDT)**. According to EDT, the right action to take is the one that one would most want to learn one had taken, considering the evidence available at the time. Essentially, it's about acting in a way that you expect would lead to the best outcome based on the evidence you have.

This approach allows for "a-causal influence" on the universe, meaning decisions can theoretically affect distant or deterministic outcomes because they are correlated. In an infinite universe scenario, any decision you make might also be made by infinitely many other individuals with matching evidence elsewhere, leading to a form of indirect influence (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[45:12]</a>).

### Infinite Ethics and Influence

A fascinating and complex issue discussed is the intersection of decision theory and infinite ethics. As Carl Smith explains, when considering infinite worlds or universes, one must grapple with how actions have infinite implications. In such cases, expected value calculations break down or become dominated by these infinite possibilities [[ethics_and_infinite_worlds | (Ethics and Infinite Worlds)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[42:44]</a>).

For instance, even with a small credence (belief) that the universe is infinite, it can lead to substantial changes in how one evaluates the potential outcomes of decisions. This consideration is especially important in discussions of existential risk, where understanding the probability and impact of our actions on potentially infinite futures is crucial [[existential_risk_and_societal_collapse | (Existential Risk and Societal Collapse)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[43:08]</a>).

## Anthropics: Self-Selection and Sampling

Anthropics deals with questions about our existence and how this knowledge affects probability assessments:

### Self-Indication Assumption (SIA) vs. Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA)

A key topic in anthropics involves the **Self-Indication Assumption (SIA)** and the **Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA)**, both of which have different implications for how we interpret our existence in the universe.

- **SIA** postulates that the probability you should assign to a hypothesis is proportional to the number of observers that exist in the universe compatible with that hypothesis. Under SIA, you should expect to find yourself in a world with many observers with similar evidence as your own. This assumption often suggests a universe filled with many civilizations [[cultural_evolution_and_collective_brains | (Cultural Evolution and Collective Brains)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>).

- **SSA** argues that you should reason as if you are a random sample from the set of all observers in your reference class. When applying SSA, your evidence may lead you to conclude that you are more likely to be in a smaller, finite universe; famously, SSA is used to argue the Doomsday argument, where under a random sampling model, you might conclude that humanity is closer to its end than the beginning in terms of human population distribution over time [[dna_evidence_regarding_human_migrations_and_mixtures | (DNA Evidence Regarding Human Migrations and Mixtures)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>).

## Conclusion

The podcast featuring Joe Carl Smith delves deeply into intricate philosophical ideas within decision theory and anthropics, dealing with immense challenges like infinite ethics and self-location probabilities. Such discussions have profound implications on how we understand rational decision-making and our place in the universe. Through analytical frameworks like EDT and anthropic assumptions like SIA and SSA, philosophers strive to untangle the threads of choice and existence that define our reality and moral responsibilities.

Garrett Jones, an economist at George Mason University and author of "The Culture Transplant: How Migrants Make the Economies They Move To a Lot Like the Ones They Left," delves deeply into the complex interplay between migration and democracy in his work. In a recent podcast, he explored these themes, provoking thought on how cultural migration affects democratic structures.

## Culture vs. Politics

Jones discusses a critical aspect of his thesis: the impact of cultural migration on a nation's politics, not solely through formal political participation like voting but through cultural presence and influence. "The way citizens influence a country through formal democracy is important," he notes, "but citizens end up placing some kind of limits on the government anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Cultural Presence Without Suffrage

A significant portion of the conversation is devoted to the dual impact migrants have on a country: through cultural presence and political participation. Even if migrants are not able to vote, their cultural values can heavily influence the host nation. Jones estimates a "50-50" split between cultural influence and political action in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## The “Spaghetti Theory”

One of the intriguing ideas Jones presents is the "Spaghetti Theory," which suggests cultural assimilation is more about convergence than domination. When migrants integrate into a host society, there's a blending of cultures that often brings about changes in both migrant and native populations’ cultures, akin to Americans eating more spaghetti after Italian immigration. The result is "some part where people meet in the middle between the values that were previously existing and the values that migrants have brought with them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Constraints on Democracy

Jones also responds to the concern about whether democracy can be undermined by the influence of migrants, especially those from countries with different democratic norms. His stance is that cultural migration has dual edges: "Sometimes those cultural norms are better than what you've got, and sometimes they're worse than what you've got" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Democracy and Economic Freedom

The conversation shifts towards economic impacts, where Jones provides a statistical analysis relating to migration from more corrupt countries and changes in economic freedom. His findings generally trend negative, complicating the picture of cultural transfers affecting democratic ideals and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Jones’ insights offer a nuanced view of [[effects_of_migration_on_cultural_and_political_systems | cultural transplants]] and democracy that shifts focus from a simplistic narrative of migrant influence through voting to the subtler, yet profound, impact of cultural integration. Whether seen as a benefit or a detriment, the cultural transplant undeniably plays a role in shaping the economic and democratic landscapes of a host nation. The ongoing dialogue around these effects cautions us to consider both the visible and invisible influences of migration on democratic institutions.

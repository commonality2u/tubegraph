Censorship is a powerful tool utilized by the Chinese government to control information and maintain a particular narrative of history. During the podcast interview with Yung Chang, several aspects of censorship and historical revisionism in China were discussed, particularly focusing on its impact on the understanding of history among Chinese citizens.

## The Role of Censorship

The Chinese government maintains a tight grip on information, particularly literature and historical records that might challenge the established narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Censorship has been a longstanding tradition in China, vastly intensified during the regime of Mao Zedong. Under [[maos_rise_to_power_in_china | Mao]], books were burned, schools were closed, and a nationwide cultural desert was created, with no access to cinemas, theaters, or museums for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Censorship's primary objective is to prevent the dissemination of any information that contradicts or criticizes the party's version of events. As a result, much of China's modern history, particularly during Mao's reign, is often misrepresented or entirely omitted from public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.

## Historical Revisionism and Mao Zedong

The legacy of Mao Zedong is a significant focus of historical revisionism. Despite the catastrophic consequences of his policies, including the [[impact_of_maos_policies_on_china | Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution]] that led to the deaths of millions, Mao is still revered in China largely due to historical revisionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. The current regime continues to promote Mao as a revered figure, which helps maintain the CCP's legitimacy, as Mao's picture still hangs on Tiananmen Square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

## Impact on Modern Understanding

Due to these censorship policies, many in China today lack a complete understanding of their own history. This is exacerbated by the fact that many parents, as a protective measure, do not share their own harsh experiences from the [[experiences_during_chinas_great_leap_forward | Mao era]] with their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. As a result, successive generations are growing up without knowledge of the atrocities committed during Mao’s rule.

Additionally, access to books that provide a comprehensive and objective account of those times, such as Yung Chang's "Wild Swans" or her biography of Mao, "Mao: The Unknown Story," is significantly restricted in China. While these books were once smuggled into the country, strict regulations now punish possession of such "banned literature" with severe penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

China's use of censorship and historical revisionism serves to control the narrative surrounding its tumultuous history. By selectively revising history to portray the CCP in a favorable light, the government ensures its continued legitimacy and control. However, this has resulted in a significant portion of the population being unaware of the full extent of their history, creating a populace that is often unable or afraid to question the status quo. The control over historical narrative through censorship remains one of the Chinese government’s most effective tools in [[communist_tactics_in_maintaining_power | maintaining power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

Nuclear deterrence has been a pivotal subject in discussions about global conflict since the advent of nuclear weapons. This concept has shaped the strategies of countries in avoiding catastrophic warfare. In a recent discussion with historian Andrew Roberts, numerous insights were shared regarding the influence and changing role of nuclear deterrence in past and potential future conflicts.

## The Role of Nuclear Deterrence Post-1945

Andrew Roberts expounded on how the invention of the nuclear bomb [[the_development_of_the_atomic_bomb | post-1945]] has had a profound impact on global conflicts. It introduced an “umbrella under which everybody acts” [00:02:31]. Following WWII, despite the outbreak of around 140 wars, conflicts had to be fought in a limited manner due to the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons [00:02:46].

## Lucky Escapes in the Nuclear Age

Roberts illustrates the role of nuclear deterrence by discussing the Cuban Missile Crisis. The crisis did not escalate into a nuclear war, highlighting one of several instances where nuclear weapons did not result in mass destruction, thanks in part to the concept of deterrence [[historical_perspectives_on_nuclear_weapons_and_deterrence | deterrence]] [00:02:15]. The awareness of the obliterative power of nuclear weapons serves as a form of deterrent itself, keeping wars limited [00:03:27].

## Hypotheticals on Nukes in Historical Conflicts

The conversation also ventured into hypothetical scenarios, such as the potential use of nuclear weapons in the [[historical_case_studies_of_world_war_ii | Korean War]]. If General MacArthur had used nuclear weapons against the Chinese crossing the Yalu River, it might have shaped a very different global stance on nuclear use. It could have normalized the use of such weapons, significantly lowering the "moral barrier" and potentially leading to their use in subsequent conflicts [00:17:18]. This restraint shown by leaders like Truman is credited with maintaining the nuclear taboo [00:18:21].

## Current and Future Relevance of Deterrence

Despite historical restraint, deterrence today is questioned in regions like Southeast Asia. While deterrence seems effective with rational actors like China, based on strategic ambiguity and the might of allied forces like the United States, there are concerns about irrational actors who may not fear nuclear reprisals. This includes non-state actors, as highlighted by incidents supported by states like Iran [[potential_future_advancements_in_gene_editing_and_artificial_intelligence | Iran]] [00:22:25].

## The Challenge of Maintaining Deterrence

As Andrew Roberts points out, modern-day deterrence also involves credible threats. It hinges upon whether it's believable that a nation like the US would kinetically respond to an act such as China blockading Taiwan [[geopolitical_strategies_during_the_cold_war | Taiwan]] [00:26:02]. The deterrence has to be credible enough to deter adversaries from actions that would prompt intervention.

## Conclusion

Nuclear deterrence remains a complex balancing act that influences global peace and conflict. While it has prevented large-scale nuclear war, the evolving geopolitical landscape, with the rise of technology and participation of non-state actors, continues to test its efficacy. Understanding its historical importance and anticipating its future role remain crucial for policymakers and historians alike.

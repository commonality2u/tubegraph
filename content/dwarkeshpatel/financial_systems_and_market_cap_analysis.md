In a recent podcast, Patrick McKenzie (known online as patio11) discussed various aspects of financial systems, market capitalization (market cap), and the impact of crypto assets on society. Patrick's insights offer a critical evaluation of how market cap should be perceived, particularly in the context of the cryptocurrency boom.

## Understanding Market Cap

Market capitalization, often referred to simply as market cap, is typically used as a measure of a company's size or the total value of a company's outstanding shares. However, Patrick indicates that many people misconstrue market cap as a definitive cost imposed on society. The true cost, according to him, is determined by how societal resources are allocated and whether they produce valuable outcomes.

## Crypto Market Cap: An Insight

During the conversation, Patrick elaborated on the hype surrounding cryptocurrency market caps, which at their peak were valued at around $3 trillion. He posed a critical question: what does this number represent? He speculated that much of the valuation may have been a redistribution of wealth from less savvy investors to more knowledgeable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Evaluating the Cost of Crypto

Patrick compelled listeners to consider the cost of creating and maintaining crypto versus its actual utility. He warned that the investment into crypto infrastructure involved billions in rivalrous resources like electricity and time from skilled professionals, resources that could potentially have been used for other societal benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

### Vitalik Buterin’s Reflection

Patrick referenced Vitalik Buterin’s contemplation on whether the crypto sphere has warranted its massive market valuations. Buterin questioned how many real-world problems these crypto projects solved, how many unbanked individuals they banked, and how many meaningful distributed applications were created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

## Historical Perspective: Dot-Com Bubble Analogy

Patrick likened the current crypto market to the dot-com bubble, suggesting that although many initial investors lost money, the infrastructure built during that time later became invaluable, facilitating the internet boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This comparison draws parallels to the [[development_and_impact_of_ai_technologies_including_llms | evolution and impact of AI technologies]].

### Future Potential and Skepticism

He posed a speculative query about the time frame at which society should assess the fulfillment of crypto's promises—speculating on 2030 as a reasonable timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Patrick predicted that, even by 2030, the conversation might persist with claims that crypto still hadn’t reached its potential, invoking the notion of being "early" to the market. This speculation parallels discussions on [[ai_progress_forecasting | AI Progress Forecasting]] and the uncertainty in timelines.

## Conclusion

Patrick McKenzie's insights reveal the complexities and speculative nature of market cap, especially concerning cryptocurrencies. His analysis challenges the perception of market cap as an effective measure of value and calls for a closer examination of real-world impacts versus speculative worth. This underscores the importance of aligning investment in innovations like crypto with genuine societal benefits, much like the ongoing debate in [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_ai_in_society | AI's potential risks and benefits for society]].

Libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism are closely related political philosophies concerned with the role and authority of the state in society. In an insightful discussion with Professor Michael Huemer on the Lunar Society Podcast, these concepts were explored in depth, touching upon the philosophical underpinnings and real-world implications.

## Defining Libertarianism and Anarcho-Capitalism

Libertarianism is broadly defined by skepticism about state authority and a belief that individuals should be free to make their own choices, with minimal government interference. Professor Huemer argued that the fundamental aspect uniting libertarians is this skepticism about authority, asserting that moral standards applied to ordinary people should also apply to the state. In other words, if stealing is wrong for individuals, it should be wrong for governments as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Anarcho-capitalism, a more extreme form of libertarianism, posits that all government functions can and should be handled by private entities in a free market. This includes traditionally state-run services like policing and courts. Huemer suggests a gradual transition from democracy to anarcho-capitalism by privatizing government functions over time, rather than through abrupt elimination of these functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

## The Problem of Authority

One of the central issues discussed in the podcast is the justification for government authority. Huemer questions why governments are treated as having a special moral status that allows them to do things considered immoral for individuals, such as imposing taxes or going to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He argues that many people have an inherent bias in favor of the status quo and governments due to evolutionary and psychological factors like Stockholm Syndrome, where individuals develop loyalty towards those in power over them [[human_evolutionary_biology_and_anthropology | due to deep-rooted evolutionary biology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Historical Context and Empirical Evidence

The podcast also delves into the historical effects of centralized state power. Huemer concedes that the rise of states historically reduced small-scale violence by suppressing personal conflicts, even while often instigating large-scale wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. However, he challenges the Hobbesian view that without a leviathan, society would fall into chaos, drawing on [[cultural_evolution_and_collective_brains | evolutionary psychology]] to explain why violence has been historically prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

## Potential Criticisms

Several criticisms of anarcho-capitalism were considered. One major concern is the potential emergence of private entities that mimic states by charging protection money, effectively creating a new kind of coercion. Huemer argues that in a mature anarcho-capitalist society, it would be difficult to establish such entities due to the decentralized nature of security provision and market forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

Another concern is the inability of anarcho-capitalist societies to manage existential risks, such as new technologies that could enable individuals to cause massive harm. Though Huemer acknowledges this as a strong argument for state power, he counters that government development of destructive technologies remains a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>, also drawing parallels to [[the_parallels_between_nuclear_technology_and_modern_advancements_like_ai | nuclear technology and AI advancements]].

> [!info] Conclusion
>
> Libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism challenge conventional views on government authority, proposing a system where individual liberty and voluntary cooperation replace state control. The transition to such a system, however, requires careful consideration of potential risks and challenges, as outlined by Professor Huemer during his engaging discussion. The philosophical exploration of these ideas raises important questions about morality, power, and the future of societal organization, much like current debates on [[the_role_of_kinship_and_social_organization_in_human_history | kinship and social organization in human history]].

## Relocating and Career Paths

Collison begins his advice by re-evaluating a piece of guidance he had previously shared: that young people should move to vibrant hubs like [[san_francisco_as_a_cultural_and_career_destination | San Francisco]] to kickstart their careers. However, he now expresses some reservations:

- **San Francisco Specifics**: While many can benefit from the entrepreneurial spirit of places like San Francisco, it's not a fit for everyone. San Francisco's culture celebrates individualism and entrepreneurship, epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
- **Pursuit of Expertise**: There are career paths where deep technical knowledge and prolonged study are necessary. He points to successful careers like those of Herb Boyer, who required decades to accumulate the knowledge that led to breakthrough innovations, as examples of [[the_value_of_deep_technical_knowledge_and_expertise | the importance of depth over breadth]] for some individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Individualism vs. Expertise

San Francisco is praised for its emphasis on entrepreneurship and defiance of conventional wisdom. However, Collison argues that the pursuit of significant technical achievements should not be undermined. This city might not encourage individuals to aim for the in-depth knowledge that figures like Boyer exemplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Diverse Career Advices

Patrick Collison is keen on the diversity of career paths and encourages 20-somethings to consider different approaches:

- **Value of Information Dissemination**: Collison highlights the importance of roles that focus on spreading crucial information, mentioning podcasts as a valuable outlet for increasing "catalytic surface area" of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
- **Alternatives to Entrepreneurship**: While appreciating startups and innovations, Collison reminds us of significant contributions from established organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>.

## Exploration and Learning

Collison advises young individuals to explore domains of interest and actively pursue environments where they can learn the highest standards and immerse themselves in cultures or institutions that embody excellence. This is about seeing where high standards are embodied and where one can observe and absorb them firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Strategy Over Imitation

There isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy, and Collison suggests not following his or anyone's path too rigidly. He emphasizes that there are many successful strategies, and it is crucial for individuals to decide what works best for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

In summary, Patrick Collison's advice offers a nuanced view that encourages individuals in their 20s to think critically about their environments, career choices, and the depth of expertise they wish to pursue. It advocates for both the pursuit of technical depth and the embrace of diverse paths, fostering a balanced approach to career development and personal growth.

The concept of institutional political leaning—whether an institution should be classified as left-wing or right-wing—has been a topic of discussion and debate across many fields, including political science, sociology, and economics. In a recent interview with [[tyler_cowen | Tyler Cowen]], this concept was revisited with a particular focus on [[conquests_second_law_and_its_critiques | Conquest's Second Law]], which posits that any organization not explicitly right-wing will inevitably drift left over time.

## Understanding Conquest's Second Law

Conquest's Second Law suggests that institutions, unless intentionally and continually steered right, tend to move toward leftist ideologies. This theory posits a natural drift toward more progressive or liberal policies and practices within institutions as time progresses. However, Tyler Cowen offers a critical perspective on this assertion:

> "First of all, I'm not sure that Conquest's Second Law is true... So I do think for a big part of the latter post-war era some version of Conquest's Law does mostly hold for the United States, but once you see it is not universal, you're just asking, well, why have parts—why has the American intelligentsia shifted to the left?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

## Examining the Drift: Factors and Counterexamples

### Political Science and Educational Polarization

Cowen points to the existing political science literature that addresses educational polarization. This literature often explores how [[cultural_influence_on_fertility_rates | educational institutions influence ideological shifts]] over time:

> "There's a political science literature on educational polarization... So, I think that's why Conquest's Law locally is mostly holding." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

Educational and cultural shifts, coupled with changing social norms, might contribute to the perception that institutions naturally become more left-leaning.

### Historical and Global Perspectives

Cowen also challenges the universality of Conquest's Second Law by pointing out historical and global exceptions:

> "Take the World Bank, which is sort of centrist-statist in the 1960s but by the 1990s has become fairly [[neoliberal | neoliberal]], a concept tied to [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_educational_innovation_and_technology | economic and educational shifts]]. Now, what's left-wing, right-wing in that—it's global, it's complicated." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

This observation invites a more nuanced analysis of institutions' political directions, arguing that the drift toward leftism might not be as prevalent or linear as Conquest's Law suggests.

## The Complexity of Political Labels

Cowen emphasizes the fluidity and context-dependent nature of political labels over time:

> "I think by choosing the word left-wing, you're begging the question... So, once I had a debate with [[marc_andreessen | Marc Andreessen]] about this... Um, in medieval times, what's left-wing, what's right-wing, even 17th century England?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>

What one era or context might label as left or right could shift dramatically in another context. The labels themselves are relative and change with sociopolitical dynamics.

## Conclusion

The discussion on left-wing versus right-wing institutional drift highlights the layered complexity behind such shifts. While Conquest's Second Law provides a sweeping hypothesis, Cowen's insights advocate for a more contextual and history-sensitive understanding. The ideological trajectory of an institution can depend heavily on external factors such as education, culture, historical precedent, and specific policy decisions. Acknowledging these nuances can lead to a richer understanding of [[technological_and_social_innovation | how institutions evolve politically over time]].

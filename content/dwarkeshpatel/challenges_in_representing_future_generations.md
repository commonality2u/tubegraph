In the podcast with [[effective_altruism_movement | William MacAskill]], a seminal figure in the effective altruism movement, the topic of representing future generations and the inherent challenges associated with it is discussed in depth. As MacAskill elaborates, there are significant philosophical, practical, and institutional hurdles that must be considered. Below is a detailed exploration into the challenges faced when trying to advocate for the interests of those who cannot yet speak for themselvesâ€”future generations.

## The Fundamental Issue of Representation
One of the core challenges in representing future generations is the absence of these individuals to advocate for themselves. As MacAskill points out, future people are not around to lobby for their interests or represent themselves in today's decision-making processes.

> Future generations cannot engage in advocacy or influence current policy, making them highly susceptible to being underrepresented or misrepresented. MacAskill elucidates this issue while discussing the challenges of creating institutions geared towards long-term priorities (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>).

## Institutional Designs for Long-Term Representation

### Co-opting Risks
MacAskill warns that efforts to construct institutions for future generations may be easily hijacked by present-day interests. This co-option is exacerbated by the lack of a concrete constituency to hold current representatives accountable.

> Institutions that are meant to represent future interests can be easily co-opted by present-day actors due to the absence of direct accountability from those future stakeholders (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>).

### Long-term Incentives
In considering ways to mitigate co-option risks, MacAskill describes potential mechanisms such as future evaluations of decision-making bodies, where performance assessments are conducted by subsequent generations.

> These assessments would ideally occur every 30 years and influence the benefits received by past decision-makers. However, implementing such a framework is fraught with challenges and uncertainties in its robustness and practical efficacy (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>).

## Philosophical and Moral Challenges

### Moral Contingency
MacAskill discusses why present values may not align with what future societies consider morally preferable. He argues against locking in current Western values as absolute, emphasizing the importance of continuous moral questioning and development [[moral_progress_and_contingency_of_values | in light of the evolving nature of morality]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>).

### Temporal Bias
Present-day decision-makers are inherently inclined to prioritize short-term results due to temporal biases, often neglecting considerations that would favor future generations.

These biases are a considerable challenge in advocating for sustainable, forward-thinking policies that genuinely represent the interests of future generations [[moral_progress_and_ethical_intuitions | through evolving ethical intuitions]].

## Potential Solutions and Strategies

### Speculative Institutional Reforms
MacAskill explores the concept of assembling dedicated bodies focused on long-termism [[longtermism_and_its_implications | and its implications]], though he remains skeptical of their potential for success given the intrinsic challenges of representing non-existent constituencies (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>).

### Leveraging Historical Insights
To develop effective strategies, there is a need for greater engagement with historical trends and understanding past successes and failures in institutional long-term thinking [[historical_and_philosophical_influences_on_technology | informed by philosophical influences]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>).

In conclusion, while the representation of future generations presents a myriad of challenges ranging from philosophical dilemmas to institutional vulnerabilities, MacAskill highlights the importance of continued effort and innovation. As policymakers and thinkers grapple with these questions, it becomes clear that a combination of forward-thinking policies, robust institutional structures, and an evolving moral framework will be essential in effectively representing those who are yet to come.

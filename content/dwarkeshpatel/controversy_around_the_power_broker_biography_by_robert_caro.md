Robert Caro's "[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York](robert_moses_impact_on_new_york_city_infrastructure)" is a monumental biography that delves into the life and legacy of Robert Moses, one of the most powerful urban planners in American history. Despite its acclaim, the biography is not without controversy. This article explores the criticisms and debates surrounding Caro's work, particularly concerning its portrayal of Moses.

## Overview of "The Power Broker"
"The Power Broker" is credited with bringing Robert Moses, a figure previously obscure to the general public, into the spotlight. It details his immense influence on the infrastructure of New York City and paints him as a formidable yet flawed character.

## Criticisms of Caro's Approach

### Alleged Biases and Errors
Kenneth T. Jackson, a preeminent historian on New York City, argues that Caro's portrayal of Moses is at times unfair and inaccurate. Jackson, during a discussion, admitted the book is a "stunning achievement" but criticized it for containing what he claims are numerous minor inaccuracies and for being overly harsh on Moses' character.

Jackson has suggested that Caro had formed his opinion of Moses as a "jerk" before completing the research for the book, which may have influenced the narrative. This predisposition, according to Jackson, led Caro to overlook or misrepresent certain aspects of Moses' legacy, particularly in the realm of public transit and the impact on certain neighborhoods like the Bronx.

### Moses’ Response to the Biography
In response to "The Power Broker," Robert Moses penned an article published in The New Yorker, criticizing Caro’s depiction of his life and projects. However, many viewed Moses' rebuttal as unfocused and lacking specificity in addressing the claims made in Caro's book.

## Impact of the Controversy

### Cultural Prominence of Caro's Work
Despite these criticisms, "The Power Broker" has achieved significant cultural prominence, partly due to Caro's compelling narrative and the book’s alignment with modern skepticism about centralized power and urban development. Caro’s work resonates with today's audience, who often hold a critical view of figures who wield disproportionate influence in urban planning without democratic oversight.

### Enduring Legacy
The biography has sparked discussions about the balance between infrastructure development and community impact, a topic still relevant as cities grapple with urban planning challenges. This ongoing debate contributes to the sustained interest in Moses' life and legacy, as well as continued rereading and critique of Caro’s portrayal.

He suggests that Caro’s work remains a landmark contribution to urban history and biography, despite its contentious aspects.

In conclusion, while "The Power Broker" undeniably transformed public perception of Robert Moses and urban development, it also stirred significant controversy over its narrative style and factual accuracy.

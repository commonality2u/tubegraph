## Impacts of Polygamy and Polyandry on Marriage Markets

In a fascinating discussion on the dynamics of marriage markets, Dr. David Friedman offers an intriguing perspective on how the legalization of polygamy (polygyny) and polyandry could affect men's and women's positions within these markets. His analysis delves into economic models of marriage, highlighting how these practices could shift societal norms and expectations in unexpected ways.

### The Economic Model of Marriage

Dr. Friedman introduces an economic model of marriage to explain how the institution functions as a market system. In this framework, individuals in the marriage market negotiate implicit prices, where terms are set based on who takes on specific roles within a marriage—such as decision-making responsibilities and household duties [[role_of_kinship_and_social_organization_in_human_history | the role of kinship and social organization in human history]].

### Effects of Polygyny

Polygyny, the practice of a man having multiple wives, is traditionally perceived as giving men a competitive edge in the marriage market. However, Dr. Friedman suggests otherwise; he argues that polygyny could actually benefit women and potentially harm men. When polygyny is legalized, wealthier or more desirable men might seek to have multiple wives, thereby increasing the demand—and by extension, the "price"—of a wife [[economic_and_social_impacts_of_ai | economic and social impacts of AI]].

This results in women either getting all of one husband's attention and resources on better terms or opting for half of a husband on terms that are better than marrying an entire less desirable partner. For monogamous men, this might mean agreeing to more unfavorable conditions to secure a wife, such as taking on more household responsibilities [[economic_impact_of_ai_on_future_economic_growth | economic impact of AI on future economic growth]].

### Effects of Polyandry

Similarly, if legal frameworks allow polyandry, where a woman can have multiple husbands, the effect is mirrored but with genders reversed. This could lead to circumstances where the marriage market for men becomes more competitive, with women having the upper hand. Thus, the price of men would be bid up, potentially resulting in women negotiating better terms for marriage, like more autonomy within family dynamics [[human_evolutionary_biology_and_anthropology | human evolutionary biology and anthropology]].

### The Complexity of the Real-World Marriage Market

The discussion also touches on the complexity of real-world marriage markets versus simplified economic models. In reality, individuals have varying tastes and valuations for partners, which makes the sorting process in dating and marriage significantly more nuanced. Search costs and personal preferences add layers of complexity that computers and models cannot easily replicate [[efficient_dating_markets_and_online_dating_challenges | efficient dating markets and online dating challenges]].

### Conclusion

Dr. Friedman's exploration of polygamy and polyandry highlights the intricate ways cultural practices can impact the economic landscape of marriage markets. By challenging traditional perceptions, he invites further discussion on how legal and social shifts could redefine the incentives and dynamics at play for both men and women in marriage.

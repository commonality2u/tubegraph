Kyle Harper, Professor and Provost Emeritus at the University of Oklahoma, discusses the multifaceted transformation of the Roman Empire, particularly focusing on the period from the High Roman Empire (Pax Romana, 1st-2nd century) through the late antique/early medieval period (6th-7th century) [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]]. During this time, the city of Rome, once the world's largest and the center of a vast network, saw its population plummet from its peak to a mere 50,000-100,000 people, a tenth or twentieth of its former size. Harper argues that environmental factors, especially diseases and climate change, played a significant role in this dramatic shift [[climate_change_in_historical_contexts | climate change in historical contexts]].

## Key Environmental Factors

### Diseases and Pandemics
Diseases, particularly the bubonic plague (caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*), had a devastating impact on human populations throughout history, including the Roman period. These plague events were capable of causing death rates orders of magnitude beyond what ancient societies were accustomed to, even in a world where baseline mortality was already high [[the_impact_of_diseases_like_yersinia_pestis_on_historical_population_changes | the impact of diseases like Yersinia pestis on historical population changes]].

*   **The Plague of Justinian (6th Century):** This pandemic is considered a major factor in the changes experienced by the Roman Empire. While precise mortality statistics are unavailable, the sheer shock expressed by contemporary Romans, who were used to high death rates (estimated at 3-4% of the population annually in normal years), indicates the plague's extraordinary lethality [[impact_of_plagues_on_human_history | impact of plagues on human history]].
*   **The Black Death (14th Century):** Though occurring much later, the Black Death provides a benchmark for the potential impact of *Yersinia pestis*, with evidence suggesting it killed 50-60% of the population in entire regions, cities, and provinces. Harper notes the possibility that the Plague of Justinian may have had death rates approaching or even exceeding 60% in affected areas [[existential_risk_and_societal_collapse | existential risk and societal collapse]].

### Climate Change
Alongside pandemics, the Roman world experienced significant natural climate change, particularly during the 6th and 7th centuries. This period was marked by abrupt and substantial cooling, a fact largely unknown until relatively recent paleoclimate data became available [[economic_and_political_structures_in_historical_contexts | economic and political structures in historical contexts]].

*   **Volcanic Eruptions:** The primary cause for this cooling was a series of major volcanic eruptions. Volcanoes eject sulfur into the stratosphere, which aerosolizes and creates a reflective shield, scattering incoming solar radiation and leading to short-term cooling.
*   **Impact on Temperature and Agriculture:** These eruptions cooled the global climate by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius for several decades, and in some ways, for up to a century and a half. Such a significant temperature drop impacts the hydrological cycle, potentially making wetter areas drier and vice versa. For agricultural societies like Rome, blocked sun and cold temperatures led to crop failures and famine [[the_effects_of_agriculture_on_human_genetics_and_societal_development | the effects of agriculture on human genetics and societal development]].

The Romans thus faced a "wham bam double shock" of climate change, famine, and plague [[challenges_in_ai_alignment_and_potential_risks | challenges in AI alignment and potential risks]].

## Societal Interpretation of Catastrophe

Lacking modern scientific understanding like germ theory or climatology, people in the late Roman world struggled to explain these devastating events. With nature seemingly "going crazy," widespread death from disease, and failing crops, they turned to the worldviews available to them. This led to a surge in apocalyptic thought during the 6th and 7th centuries. Christianity, with its inherent eschatological elements, saw a sharpened emphasis on the end times during this period [[cultural_evolution_and_its_role_in_human_history | cultural evolution and its role in human history]].

## Counterfactual: Could the Roman Empire Have Endured?

Harper suggests it is plausible that, without these severe environmental shocks, a Mediterranean core of the Roman Empire could have survived, encompassing both East and West, including Italy, Africa, and possibly Spain.

*   **Justinian's Successes:** Before the plague hit in the 540s, Emperor Justinian (reigned 520s-560s) was on a path of success, having retaken Africa and mostly retaken Italy [[the_most_important_century_thesis | The Most Important Century thesis]].
*   **A Different Trajectory:** Without the plague and severe climate change, the Empire might have remained a major, powerful, urbanized polity capable of resisting invasions, such as those from the southeast in the 7th century. The Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) did survive and called itself the Roman Empire until the 15th century, but its scope was diminished [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii | historical analysis of World War I and World War II]].
*   **Comparison to China:** Harper draws a parallel to China, where dynasties might collapse and geographic configurations might change, but a fundamental continuity in the core often re-emerges. A similar scenario could have been plausible for Rome [[mao_zeadong_as_a_military_and_political_leader | Mao Zedong as a military and political leader]].

The combination of plague and a severe cold snap, Harper argues, were critical random shocks that significantly altered the trajectory of the Roman Empire, which had previously survived other major pandemics [[human_genetic_and_cultural_adaptations | human genetic and cultural adaptations]].

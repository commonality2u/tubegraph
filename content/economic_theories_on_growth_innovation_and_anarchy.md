From: [[dwarkesh | The Dwarkesh Podcast]]

This article summarizes key discussions from a podcast episode featuring Tyler Cowen, focusing on the ideas of prominent economists regarding economic growth, the nature of innovation, risk, market dynamics, and the concept of anarchy. The conversation draws heavily from Cowen's book, "Goat: Who is the Greatest Economist of All Time, and Why Does It Matter?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## John Maynard Keynes

### The Master Economist and Investment
Keynes described the "master economist" as possessing a rare combination of gifts, including being a mathematician, historian, statesman, and philosopher, with a regard for all aspects of human nature and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Cowen notes that Keynes likely saw himself in this description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Keynes's *General Theory of Interest, Employment, and Money* posits that investment is often driven by more than "cold calculation." He argued that "if human nature felt no temptation to take a chance... there might not be much investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This suggests much historical investment might have been "selfishly irrational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
Cowen points out Adam Smith made a similar observation about "projectors" (entrepreneurs) being overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The returns on private investment, especially including small businesses, are highly skewed, with few making significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Innovation, Risk, and Social Returns
Innovators often don't internalize most of the gains they provide to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The commonly cited figure is that innovators capture about 2% of the social returns of their innovations, though Cowen believes this isn't based on firm data and estimates it might be 2-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This connects to Reuven Brenner's claim that humans might be more risk-seeking than is "selfishly good" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Keynes also stated, "Investment based on genuine long-term expectation is so difficult as to be scarcely practicable," suggesting it's easier to guess crowd behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. He believed short-run speculation could beat the market in his time, a view that Cowen is skeptical of but doesn't dismiss entirely for that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Keynes worried this short-term focus damaged long-term investment, leading him to consider socializing investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
The idea that contrarians are punished by society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> is challenged by revered figures like Warren Buffett, though Cowen clarifies Keynes likely meant building physical infrastructure, not stock market investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Market Maturity and Speculation
Keynes observed that as markets mature, they can become more speculative, with a larger share of equities held by passive investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Concerns about this include reduced monitoring of companies and potential collusion among large passive fund holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. However, Cowen suggests overconfidence might lead to "too much trading" from a private perspective, which could be socially preferable to "too little trading" if it aids price discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
Regarding the size of the financial sector (e.g., 8% of GDP), Cowen argues it's more relevant to consider it as a percentage of wealth (around 2% in the US), which seems less sinister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Context-Dependent Risk Behavior
The apparent contradiction between Keynes's "animal spirits" (risk-seeking) and conventional risk aversion is addressed by Milton Friedman and Savage's work on context-dependent risk. People often buy insurance (risk-averse) and gamble (risk-seeking) simultaneously, potentially as a form of "mood management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Friedrich Hayek

### Career and Views on Collectivism
Hayek's career, particularly *The Road to Serfdom* (1944) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>, is seen as a "white pill" given the decline of major collectivist states. However, Hayek became pessimistic in later years, fearing that "atavistic instincts" towards collectivism and envy would undermine impersonal orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. While some see the rise of "wokeness" as evidence for Hayek's fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>, Cowen views excessive bureaucracy and sclerotic institutions as more fundamental problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

### Central Planning vs. Decentralization
Hayek is famous for his arguments about the impossibility of effective central planning due to dispersed knowledge. When considering large tech companies like Amazon or Uber, which appear to engage in complex logistical planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, Cowen, diverging from Coase, argues that "the firm is the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. He views even the later Soviet Union not as true central planning but as a highly decentralized system with bad incentives, where managers optimized their own rents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Much of Soviet growth was attributed to urbanization and post-war rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

The computational intractability of finding a general equilibrium doesn't undermine markets, as the market's goal is "just solving for something that gets us into the next day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Hayek's essay "Competition as a Discovery Procedure" highlights that the most interesting part of markets is the dynamic process of figuring out what and how to produce, not static equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. This aligns with Peter Thiel's ideas in *Zero to One* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

### Knowledge, Scientism, and AI
Hayek perhaps underrated "scientism," which, despite potential for abuse, is relied upon heavily in a decentralized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. The fact that no single mind understands the entire system is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Supply chain vulnerabilities exposed by COVID-19 illustrate a market failing where price signals don't convey inframarginal values crucial during disruptions [[geopolitical_implications_on_technology_and_data_centers | Geopolitical Implications on Technology and Data Centers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

Regarding AI agents, Hayek reportedly found the idea of markets between them interesting and in the spirit of his work, with research on this occurring at George Mason University in the 1980s (Don Lavoie, Bill Tulloh) [[challenge_and_opportunities_in_deploying_ai_at_scale | Challenges and Opportunities in Deploying AI at Scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. Cowen predicts AIs will replicate markets, evolve their own currencies, and utilize NFT-like property rights systems [[ai_systems_and_planning_mechanisms | AI Systems and Planning Mechanisms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. This AI economy will likely integrate with the human economy rather than remaining segregated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
However, Cowen expresses a Hayekian skepticism about unlimited AI advancement [[ai_alignment_and_safety_research | AI Alignment and Safety Research]], suggesting the universe might not be fully "legible," imposing limits on how much "smarter" AI can get or what fundamental problems (like unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics) it can solve [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_ai_alignment | Potential Risks and Benefits of AI Alignment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. The concept of "tacit knowledge" itself needs rethinking in the context of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

### Other Hayekian Insights
*   **Prediction Markets:** Hayek would likely view them as mechanisms for communicating information via prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. Cowen adds that market signals are multidimensional, not just a single price dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **NIMBYism:** Hayek's writings predicted phenomena like NIMBYism [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | Historical Influences on Leadership and Innovation]], where necessary changes are difficult to implement in a democratic society if their necessity cannot be strictly demonstrated in particular cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## John Stuart Mill

### Rationalism and Social Reform
Mill, who wrote prolifically on diverse topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, argued that the subjugation of women was a result of historical power dynamics ("law of force") rather than natural order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. This argument, based on seeing beyond immediate, local information, is somewhat anti-Hayekian in its rationalism. Cowen suggests this line of reasoning could be applied to the treatment of children today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.
Mill's *On Liberty*, however, is seen as very Hayekian in its defense of free speech for information discovery [[ai_safety_and_existential_risks | AI Safety and Existential Risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. Cowen considers Mill a greater thinker than Hayek for integrating these perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
Mill was concerned with the quality and character development of the population and believed improvement was possible [[cultural_evolution_and_its_role_in_human_history | Cultural Evolution and Its Role in Human History]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

## Adam Smith

### Early Insights on Growth and Optimism
Smith, in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>, argued for markets, mechanization, and division of labor in a context where significant economic growth had not been apparent for nearly two millennia (as suggested by contemporary Edward Gibbon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. This demonstrated a rationalist ability to see potential beyond current realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.
Like Keynes, Smith also noted that entrepreneurs ("projectors") are often overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
Cowen suggests Smith would find current high growth rates (e.g., 10% annually) inconceivable and would emphasize human and legal bottlenecks to AI-driven growth [[economic_growth_and_technological_development | Economic Growth and Technological Development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.
Smith also cautioned that extreme division of labor could make people "a bit feeble-minded" [[the_value_of_spaced_repetition_and_memory_systems | The Value of Spaced Repetition and Memory Systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>, a comment Cowen applies to the increasing specialization in modern economics.

## Theories of Anarchy

### Network Industries and Collusion
Cowen argues that true anarchy faces challenges from network industries [[challenges_in_ai_governance | Challenges in AI Governance]]. Specifically, systems like banking clearinghouses and payments networks could foster cartel-like dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. If a clearinghouse can enforce collusion by threatening exclusion from the payment system, this poses a problem for anarchic orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. This vulnerability is seen in Web 3.0 with centralized crypto exchanges, though the ease of creating new crypto assets might provide a check [[crypto_skepticism_and_the_impact_of_cryptocurrency | Crypto Skepticism and the Impact of Cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>.

### Anarchy as an Inherent State
Cowen suggests anarchy is, in a sense, "everywhere," existing within governmental structures (e.g., federalism, between different branches of government) [[grand_strategy_and_national_power_coordination | Grand Strategy and National Power Coordination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. Any persistent anarchic system would itself likely evolve forms of collusion to enable its survival. The classic argument that "government is allowed under anarchy" (and would re-evolve) is seen as correct, though the form it takes can vary greatly (e.g., Haiti's gangs vs. medieval Iceland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. The international system, where nations coordinate to punish bad actors (e.g., sanctions on North Korea), also displays anarchic characteristics with emergent order [[sinoindian_and_sinosoviet_relations | Sino-Indian and Sino-Soviet Relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

## Broader Themes in Economic Growth and Innovation

### Measuring Long-Term Growth
Comparing GDP per capita across vast historical periods (e.g., Roman Empire vs. today) is fraught with index number problems. Cowen uses the "Sears Roebuck catalog" thought experiment: given a sum of money, would you prefer to buy from today's catalog or one from 1905? The difficulty in answering highlights the qualitative changes that make direct numerical comparisons problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

### Universality of Economic Principles
Economic principles may extend beyond human nature. Gordon Tullock's work on the economics of ant and animal societies suggests that many principles are broadly applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. Armin Alchian and Gary Becker argued for the importance of systemic selection (profit/loss at the firm level) in ensuring economic principles hold, regardless of individual rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. A significant portion of productivity gains, especially from freer trade, comes from the elimination of the worst-performing firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.

### The Future of Economic Thought and Long-Term Risks
Cowen expresses a view that the "Great Stagnation is over," and we are returning to earlier, transformative rates of change, largely driven by AI [[future_of_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | Future of AI: Challenges and Opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>. However, he also voices concern about long-term civilizational risks, particularly the prospect of energy becoming "too cheap," potentially enabling low-cost mass destruction (e.g., a "$50,000 nuke") [[economic_impacts_of_ai_and_automation | Economic Impacts of AI and Automation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.
He believes that the future of grand economic theorizing lies more in multidisciplinary "internet writing" (blogs, podcasts) than in traditional academia, which has become highly specialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:38">[01:26:38]</a>. Consequently, he doubts there will be new "GOAT" contenders in the traditional mold [[historical_influence_of_economists_hayek_keynes_smith | Historical Influence of Economists: Hayek, Keynes, Smith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
Critiques of democratic capitalism (libertarian, egalitarian, Nietzschean/Fukuyama's "last man") are discussed, with Cowen generally finding them overstated or not yet validated by evidence [[comparative_analysis_of_human_and_ai_value_systems | Comparative Analysis of Human and AI Value Systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

AI is being used to simulate human behavior and gather insights for customer research, offering a risk-free environment for testing ideas before public release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This approach allows businesses to test assumptions and predict behavior, similar to traditional A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Simulating Audiences and Focus Groups

One key application is the ability for AI to role-play as multiple characters, effectively acting as a whole focus group or an entire audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Users can input a prompt, and the AI spins up a simulated audience to answer specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

This simulation allows for:
*   **Testing Content:** Users can test headlines, tweets, or announcements to gauge audience reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. For example, by providing three different email subject lines, the AI audience can indicate which one they would open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   **Individual Feedback:** The system can show what each individual simulated person said, providing granular feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Summarized Insights:** A summary feature consolidates the reasons behind the simulated audience's preferences, explaining why certain choices resonated with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.

This process helps in gathering "wisdom of the crowds" without the need to "throw it out into the world" and incur time and money costs, especially beneficial for those without a large existing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. It provides a feedback loop that allows for taking more risks and quantitative comparison between options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### Predicting Behavior and Personalities

Michael, a former marketing agency owner, focused on predicting behavior in economics and growth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This interest naturally extended to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Studies show that if an AI is told to adopt a certain personality, it can make decisions with a high overlap to real people with that personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. One experiment involved an AI creating a personality profile from tweets and then taking a personality test as that person, showing extremely high overlap with the real person's test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. This was even more accurate than close human acquaintances attempting the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Research indicates that a two-hour interview transcript can yield 80% accuracy in predicting big personality traits, economic game decisions, and even voting behavior, which is as accurate as interviewing the same person a second time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications for Businesses

Entrepreneurs can leverage AI for [[using_ai_for_research_and_interview_preparation | research and interview preparation]] to understand their target customers. Instead of directly interviewing customers, a founder can talk to a chatbot like ChatGPT or Claude to understand customer needs in unfamiliar industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. This allows them to figure out how certain customer types think and what their daily lives are like, acting as a "good place to start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

Michael is building a tool called "Rally" (askrally.com) to further develop these capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Rally allows users to select specific audiences (e.g., Millennials, Manufacturing CEOs, Hacker News audience) and ask them questions, essentially running A/B tests on creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This expands the space in which businesses can experiment without needing an unlimited budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

> "The thing that kind of convinced me to get working on this a bit more was that you changed your mind. I don't know if that's like, it's like very rare that I see a CEO change their mind about anything. So I was like, okay, this, there might be something here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>

This demonstrates that AI-driven insights can be compelling enough to influence real-world decisions and strategies, even for seasoned professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

## AI as a Learning Accelerator

AI tools help individuals [[developing_ai_products_with_user_feedback | learn a lot faster]] by providing immediate feedback and allowing for continuous refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. For example, a junior writer improved significantly by using AI to compare their drafts with edited versions, effectively creating a "rule book" for their writing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This process externalizes implicit knowledge, making it explicit and actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## AI's Role in Judgment and Evaluation

AI models are surprisingly good at judging the results of tasks, even if they can't do the task perfectly themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. While large language models (LLMs) might be "too nice" and overestimate scores on a scale (e.g., always giving a 4 out of 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, they excel at binary (0 or 1) classifications.

For example, to evaluate an article, one can define criteria as "good hook" (1) or "bad hook" (0), or "concise" (1) or "not concise" (0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. By combining scores from multiple binary judgments, a more reliable aggregate score is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

AI can also be used for comparison: by giving it two different articles and asking for the differences, those differences can then become new evaluation criteria for automated judging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This [[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | data analysis]] approach is valuable for [[analyzing_customer_feedback_and_improving_business_products_with_ai | improving products]] like email summaries, where AI helps identify what constitutes a "good" or "bad" summary by comparing human-edited versions to AI-generated ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Limitations and Future Outlook

While AI offers immense value, it's crucial to remember it's "another opinion," not a perfect answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The results are highly dependent on factors like the audience spun up and the specific questions asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. The "space of possibilities" for messages is vast, meaning only a small portion can ever be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Therefore, human creativity and good ideas remain essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. AI helps in brainstorming and testing, but human judgment is still central to finalizing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

AI is good at dealing with "inexplicit" information, unlike traditional computers that require exact, mathematical specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This allows for models to learn from examples and follow them, even if the underlying rules are not fully articulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Despite rapid advancements, human capabilities remain flexible and powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The belief that AI will automate everything and lead to homogeneous content is a misjudgment of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The future will likely involve more people working in a multi-tasking, "tending" mode, similar to a chess grandmaster playing multiple games at once, as AI handles background tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This shift will require adapting to new ways of managing work with the benefits and trade-offs of increased automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

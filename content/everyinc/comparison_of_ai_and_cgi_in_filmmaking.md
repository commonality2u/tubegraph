The introduction of [[AI in filmmaking | AI tools]] has generated considerable discussion, particularly within the [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_filmmaking | traditional filmmaking]] community, concerning its potential [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_filmmaking | impact on who gets to make films, what films get made, and who gets paid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite initial backlash, many are beginning to recognize the positive aspects of [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] and how it can enhance opportunities for storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## AI as an Opportunity for Creators

The adoption of [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] can be seen as a necessary evolution, opening new pathways for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It offers significant opportunities to individuals who might otherwise lack connections or resources, such as aspiring filmmakers from diverse backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] dramatically expands the territory of people able to create, akin to how it enables more individuals to build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## AI vs. CGI: Applications and Consent

A key aspect of understanding [[AI in filmmaking | AI]]'s role is its comparison to existing technologies like Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI). Discussions with entities like the SAG board of directors have focused on differentiating CGI from [[AI in filmmaking | AI]], especially concerning topics like digital doubles and the potential for [[AI in film production | AI]] to replace actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

While the full extent of [[AI in film production | AI]]'s future impact on actors remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, it is anticipated that [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] will be utilized similarly to how CGI is currently employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This includes using [[AI in film production | AI]] to:
*   Create large-scale crowds in stadiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Generate digital doubles of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Crucially, the use of [[AI in film production | AI]] for digital likenesses is expected to require consent, and individuals should be compensated for the use of their likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Lowering Barriers to Entry

[[AI in filmmaking | AI]] tools significantly reduce the cost and skill level required to begin making films, even a small video clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This contrasts sharply with past challenges in filmmaking, where creating professional-looking content was costly and demanding, often requiring exceptional technical prowess, such as developing 3D animated movies in the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

With the availability of [[AI in film making | AI filmmaking tools]], anyone can now pursue moviemaking without substantial financial investment, fostering a more accessible and inclusive creative landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The speaker suggests that if these tools had existed earlier, they might have pursued filmmaking instead of software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

This article explores a venture capital firm's attempt to replicate a highly successful investment in Nvidia using advanced AI models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and ChatGPT. The core goal is to identify a new investment opportunity, dubbed a "10-bagger," that shares key characteristics with their past successes.

## The Nvidia Investment Blueprint

In January 2019, Nvidia was purchased at $33 a share, a price that later soared to $800 a share, becoming "the trade of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The investment thesis behind Nvidia was based on several factors:
*   **Temporary Downturn**: The price was down due to the trade war, which was considered a temporary risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Technology**: Nvidia held a position of power due to its proprietary GPU architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Market Growth**: Its market position was expected to grow significantly with the increasing need for high-powered CPUs due to machine learning and gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

This successful trade served as the benchmark for identifying future investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Investment Research

The venture capital firm set out to find a comparable investment using Gemini 1.5 Pro, a new Google model with a million-token context window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The process involved:
*   Downloading earnings call transcripts from 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Loading these transcripts into Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Asking questions to identify potential investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Initial AI-Assisted Screening

The initial approach involved filtering stocks using a TradingView screener based on a few criteria:
*   Market capitalization between a few billion and $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Positive gross profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   A 6-month performance of being down about 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   A 5-year performance at or above zero, indicating temporary dysfunction but underlying strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

When Gemini was asked to filter an initial list based on the Nvidia criteria, it suggested Bill Holdings, Clavio, and Appen, but also provided caveats about the difficulty of finding the next "10-bagger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### Refining the Investment Strategy with AI

Recognizing the need for a more refined approach, the team consulted Gemini, role-playing as Warren Buffett, to construct a screener for "artificially depressed" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. This led to criteria like:
*   Price-to-earnings (PE) ratio significantly lower than historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   Price-to-book (PB) ratio significantly lower than historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

The team then used a broader industry screen, applying a PE ratio below 15, and further filtered by performance: down over the last six months but stable or up over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

### Analyzing Potential Candidates: GoGo Inc.

From the screened list, Gemini clustered companies by nature and industry position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. One company that stood out was GoGo Inc., an in-flight internet provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. The hypothesis was that GoGo might be "artificially depressed" due to public dislike of the brand, while still benefiting from distribution lock-in on airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

Upon closer inspection using GoGo's earnings call transcripts loaded into Gemini (a test of the large context window), it was revealed that management was actively discussing upgrades to its 5G ATG Network and Global Broadband (GBB) initiative, with seemingly easy upgrade paths for existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. However, external news revealed delays in their 5G network launch due to design errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This shifted the focus from an "exogenous shock" (external factor) to an internal operational issue, prompting a re-evaluation of the core investment thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

## Refined Investment Thesis: Exogenous Shock, Bottleneck, and Scalability

The revised investment thesis, drawing directly from the Nvidia and Meta (Facebook) experiences, included three key characteristics:
1.  **Exogenous Shock**: The company's stock is trading down due to an external, temporary factor (like the trade war for Nvidia or AT&T uncertainty for Meta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
2.  **Key Bottleneck Position**: The company holds a crucial, defensible position in its value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.
3.  **Highly Scalable Business Model**: The business can grow massively (e.g., 100x in a year) without hitting significant bottlenecks, a characteristic more common in digital businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

### Exploring New Sectors: Energy and SPACs

Shifting away from a purely technology focus, the team considered energy companies, as the sector had experienced downward pressure from inflation data and had opportunities from new technologies like hydrogen and renewable energy supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. Gemini suggested Midstream companies (Kinder Morgan, Enterprise Products Partners), Renewable Energy Developers (NextEra Energy, First Solar), and Energy Storage companies (Tesla, Fluence Energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. However, many of these lacked the highly scalable, low-physical-constraint business model of Nvidia or Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

The search also led to exploring former SPAC companies from 2020-2021, which often "got pretty wrecked" in the public market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. The idea was to find a company with a speculative technology that, if successful, offered massive upside and scalability.

## The Ultimate Bet: 23andMe

After evaluating several candidates and facing challenges with the AI's ability to recommend "less well-known" stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>, the team settled on 23andMe. The rationale was:
*   **Exogenous Shock (Scandal)**: The company was embroiled in a "bad scandal" and facing multiple class-action lawsuits related to a data breach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. This represented the "exogenous shock" component.
*   **Massive Upside Potential**: Despite being a "Rat's Nest of regulatory issues" and trading at 58 cents <a class="yt>01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>, the underlying genetic data could become "way more valuable now with Transformers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>, allowing for new predictions previously impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Genetic data, once valuable, could offer significant scalability.

The company was facing delisting warnings and considering splitting its business to revive its stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. Despite the high risk, the team proceeded with a $1,000 investment in 23andMe for "the content" and "the fans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Outlook

The exercise provided several key insights into [[the_changing_landscape_of_venture_capital_with_ai_advancements | the changing landscape of venture capital with AI advancements]] and [[venture_capital_decisionmaking_and_ai | venture capital decision-making with AI]]:
*   **Scarcity of Opportunity**: Even with a sound [[venture_capital_investing_strategies | investment strategy]], opportunities that perfectly fit the criteria are rare. Investors must be patient and disciplined ("good at doing nothing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:04">[01:23:04]</a>.
*   **AI Context Window vs. Data Access**: Gemini's massive context window is powerful, but accessing enough relevant, high-quality content (especially real-time financial data or premium reports) is a significant challenge due to websites preventing LLM indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>.
*   **AI Conservatism**: LLMs often exhibit caution and are hesitant to make direct recommendations, potentially limiting their usefulness for high-stakes decisions like [[assessing_spac_companies_and_their_potential_as_investments | assessing SPAC companies and their potential as investments]] or [[finding_big_ideas_in_tech | finding big ideas in tech]] where risk is inherent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. This opens opportunities for risk-tolerant AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>.
*   **Data Timeliness**: Real-time data access is crucial for investment decisions, as older data can lead to inaccurate assessments of a company's current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:34">[01:26:34]</a>.

### The Pivot to Google (Alphabet)

Surprisingly, the 23andMe trade yielded a small profit, leading to an immediate exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>. The team then pivoted to Google (Alphabet) as a new investment, believing it more closely fit the revised thesis:
*   **Exogenous Shock**: Google had recently experienced negative perception and stock price drop due to issues with Gemini and disappointing earnings related to increased capex for AI and challenges with ad unit placement in new LLM-based search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:25">[01:30:25]</a>. This confirmed the "exogenous shock" component.
*   **Key Bottleneck and Scalability**: Google's business model is incredibly scalable, and its investments in proprietary semiconductors (TPUs) and cloud infrastructure position it strongly to benefit from the AI wave, even with higher near-term costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>. This aligns with [[strategic_growth_and_monetization_in_ai_startups | strategic growth and monetization in AI startups]].
*   **Tailwind**: The [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_investing_in_ai_and_stablecoins | AI wave]] and LLM-generated search represent a significant tailwind for Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:44">[01:33:44]</a>.

Despite a lower margin of safety compared to deeply distressed assets, Google was seen as a strong candidate due to its long-term positioning and potential for growth in the AI era, akin to the resilience shown by Microsoft and Apple in past technology shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.

This experiment highlighted both the potential and limitations of using AI for complex, real-time investment decision-making, especially when data access and AI's inherent caution come into play. It underscores that while AI can assist in [[prototyping_with_ai_in_venture_capital | prototyping with AI in venture capital]] and refining theses, human judgment and the ability to act on "fat pitches" remain paramount.

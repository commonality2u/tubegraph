Walleye, a hedge fund with close to 10 billion AUM, has made a significant pivot to embrace [[ai_usage_in_the_corporate_sector | AI]] across its entire organization, aiming to be a leader in the financial industry's adoption of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>. This deliberate shift is driven by a strong conviction about the future of finance and the transformative power of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>.

## Leading by Example: Walleye's AI-First Culture

Walleye's CEO, also the CIO and managing partner, has been instrumental in spearheading the firm's [[ai_usage_in_the_corporate_sector | AI-first culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>. Recognizing the rapid advancement and accessibility of AI tools, the firm believes that ignoring them means "leaving money on the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

### CEO's Memo on AI Usage

A key communication that set the tone for Walleye's AI adoption was a memo from the CEO to the entire firm, explicitly stating the firm's commitment:

> "I use Chat GBT to write this email. You should be using it too and be proud of it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> Walleye is all in on AI. Not using these tools is like refusing to use the internet in 1995 because it wasn't perfect. That's just dumb and something I can't understand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a> As a hedge fund, we should be ashamed to leave money on the table by ignoring tools that make us faster, smarter, and more effective. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a> Using Chat GBT is not cheating. That's a non-applicable idea from academia... In the real world, using AI is like taking a magical elixir that makes you 20% smarter instantly or a lot more. So, why wouldn't you use it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> From the very top, we are building a culture around AI. This is not optional for anyone at Walleye. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> If you write, research, analyze, build decks, process data, or think for a living, you should be using ChattBT and/or other AI tools every single day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a> Managers, this is now part of your job. You need to be pushing this across your teams, starting with being fluent yourself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>

### Mandatory AI Training

The firm has implemented mandatory AI training for every single person, regardless of department or technical background, to ensure a base level of proficiency in AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This initiative aims to alleviate anxiety about job impact and provide employees with the necessary skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Cultural elements supporting this include weekly emails with leaderboards for AI tool usage, incentives for suggesting new tools, and informal weekly meetups to discuss prompts and use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Walleye's AI Conviction

The CEO, with a background in engineering and a PhD in math, started his career writing code for algorithmic strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Walleye has been using advanced statistics and AI in its pure quant trading business for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### "Current" Project: A Turning Point

A pivotal moment was two years prior, when an analyst from a stock-picking team presented a project called "Current" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This project, utilizing tools like [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT-3]], aimed to significantly improve efficiency and potentially replace the analyst's own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. The demonstration convinced the CEO that [[integrating_agents_into_existing_development_workflows | AI agents]] would absolutely be helping with analysis and providing meaning in fundamental investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### Industry Trends and Future Vision

The CEO believes the finance industry, due to its clear association between information and money, is uniquely positioned to adopt AI tools that provide an information advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. He visualizes a future where firms are heavily integrated with best-of-breed AI technology across all functions, not just investment, within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. The CEO uses the analogy of Merlin from "The Sword in the Stone," who can see glimpses of the future but not the steps in between, to describe the clarity of AI's endpoint versus the haziness of the path to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications and Productivity Gains

Walleye has seen significant productivity improvements across various departments through AI integration.

### [[the_role_of_ai_in_financial_analysis_and_trading | Quantitative Trading]] and [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | Sentiment Analysis]]

In its quantitative trading business, Walleye has leveraged [[the_role_of_ai_in_financial_analysis_and_trading | AI and nonlinear statistics]] in its models for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. More recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has dramatically enhanced the firm's ability to process unstructured data for [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | sentiment analysis]] at scale, directly contributing to money-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.

### "Current" for Fundamental Investing

The internal AI product, "Current," is a significant part of Walleye's business for fundamental long/short stock pickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>. Every team uses this tool, with usage spiking dramatically during earnings periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. "Current" processes analyst notes, broker information, PDFs, and earnings transcripts to provide real analysis and meaning, moving beyond mere summarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>. It allows for real-time processing of information and imputation of insights that humans cannot achieve as quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>.

### [[use_of_ai_in_writing_and_investment | AI in Communication and Analysis]]

Across the firm, including departments like accounting, finance, compliance, and legal, employees are encouraged to use LLMs like [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | Chat GBT]] or Bard for analysis and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The CEO personally uses AI for communication, turning tasks like writing emails or memos from hours into minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>. This is achieved by providing bullet points and context, allowing the AI to generate high-quality prose in his own voice, freeing up time for higher-level thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:01]</a>.

### Data Strategy and the "Borg" Concept

Walleye records nearly every internal Zoom call and conversation, aligning with a broader data strategy to collect all information into a "data lake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:00">[28:33:00]</a>. This "Borg" or "collective" concept aims to process these transcripts using LLMs to aid in memory, provide insights, and become predictive, particularly for risk management and investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:00">[29:34:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to link this unstructured textual data with numerical market data, internal data, and accounting data to unlock deeper insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:57:00">[38:57:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Adoption Challenges

Walleye's leadership acknowledges and addresses common psychological barriers to AI adoption.

### Addressing Fear and "Cheating" Concerns

The firm actively combats the notion that using AI is "cheating," a concept deemed non-applicable in the business world unlike academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. The message is that AI makes individuals faster, smarter, and more effective, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. The CEO emphasizes that people should not be embarrassed to use these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

### Embracing Imperfection

AI tools are not perfect and will make mistakes, but the direction of travel is very positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. Walleye fosters a culture where it is acceptable for AI demos to fail, encouraging people to embrace the tools' current state and future potential rather than waiting for perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Leadership

The CEO stresses that leaders must lead from the front to set the tone and unlock people's willingness to experiment with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>. The firm's approach is to encourage employees to be more afraid of being left behind than of making a mistake with new tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Future Outlook

The CEO views the current [[ai_usage_in_the_corporate_sector | AI transition]] through the lens of historical periods of dramatic change, such as the period between the American Civil War and World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>. This era saw rapid changes in infrastructure (railroads, transatlantic cables) that transformed industries and made existing skills obsolete, a process expected to accelerate with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>.

### Lessons from Past Disruptions

Similar to how barbed wire disrupted the cowboy way of life by introducing property rights and limiting movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>, AI represents a technological frontier that will redefine industries. While individualistic exploration thrives in new frontiers, civilization and institutionalization eventually follow, creating tension between creativity and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. Walleye aims to be a firm that can "do both" – push the frontier with resources, adapting and thriving in this technological transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>.

### Human Nature and AI's Role in Investing

The CEO believes human nature has remained constant over millennia, and historical patterns, particularly in human behavior, tend to "rhyme" if not repeat exactly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:19:00">[47:19:00]</a>. This belief underpins quantitative investing, which is built on the concept of predictive patterns in data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>. Even in world-class quant investing, models leverage nonlinear relationships and high-dimensional problems that are beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:00">[51:52:00]</a>.

While machines excel at processing structured data, human intuition remains crucial for "fuzzy" situations where machines haven't seen all priors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. AI tools are seen as augmenting human decision-making, helping to surface intuitive answers that humans might not find on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>.

### The Future of Work and Corporate Structure

The CEO is optimistic about the future, viewing AI not as an end to jobs but as a catalyst for adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:53:00">[41:53:00]</a>. Future corporations will still require many employees, but a significant portion will be AI machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. This shift necessitates constant training for efficiency to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>.

Walleye's journey is a microcosm of this broader shift, demonstrating that firms must learn to embrace and lead with AI to avoid becoming obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>.

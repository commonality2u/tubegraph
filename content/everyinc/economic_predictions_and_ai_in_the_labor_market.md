Economist Tyler Cowen, known for his prolific writing and deep thinking on technology's impact on life, work, and the economy, has been contemplating the [[impact_of_ai_on_future_work_and_the_economy | impact of AI on technology and jobs]] for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

## Early Predictions: "Average Is Over"

In his 2013 book, *Average Is Over*, Cowen discussed an economic stratification driven by what he termed "intelligent machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. He predicted that individuals whose skills complemented computers would have positive labor market prospects, while those whose skills did not would need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:45">[02:43:45]</a>. This idea highlighted a growing gap between "intelligent technical knowledge workers" and the rest of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>.

Cowen's early conviction about AI stemmed from his experience with chess. He observed that AI quickly overcame the perceived conceptual complexity of chess, leading him to believe it could accomplish many other tasks over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:40">[03:55:40]</a>. This conviction predates the current generation of consumer AI, such as ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>.

## Revisions and Current Views on AI's Impact

While his general prediction about AI's rise was accurate, Cowen admits surprises regarding the specifics of current generative models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:23">[04:38:23]</a>. He did not anticipate AI's profound facility with words, emotions, and "bedside manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:10">[04:55:10]</a>. This development suggests that "word cell classes" or professions heavily reliant on textual or emotional communication might be under greater threat than initially predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:25">[05:31:25]</a>.

### Short-Run vs. Long-Run Effects

Cowen offers a nuanced perspective on AI's [[impact_of_ai_and_chatgpt_on_productivity_and_jobs | impact on productivity and jobs]]:
*   **Short-Run:** AI will be "quite egalitarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:04">[05:59:04]</a>. It empowers individuals who previously lacked certain skills to perform tasks capably. For example, it can assist those who struggle with writing college essays or basic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:45">[06:01:45]</a>. AI can significantly augment the skills of the "bottom 60-70%" of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:52">[07:38:52]</a>.
*   **Longer-Run:** The effects are predicted to be "less egalitarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:45">[07:01:45]</a>. As people become more adept at [[using_ai_for_business_and_decision_making | using AI]], those who are skilled at initiating projects will become the primary beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:16">[06:30:16]</a>. AI tools can act as record keepers, translators, mathematicians, coaches, colleagues, and advice-givers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:10">[06:35:10]</a>. However, large language models (LLMs) do not generate ideas or make the decision to act on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:17">[06:46:17]</a>.

This leads to the concept of an "allocation economy" where individuals with strong "executive function" — those capable of initiating and allocating resources — will be highly rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:04">[06:55:04]</a>. This skill is particularly valuable for people with managerial or [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_models_and_investment | investing skills]], as AI allows them to deploy these abilities faster and more cheaply than building human organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:07">[08:31:07]</a>.

## Skills and Future Labor Market Dynamics

### The "Allocation Economy" and Managerial Skills
AI's ability to facilitate coordination means that managerial skills, traditionally confined to a small group, may need to become more widely distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:10">[10:39:10]</a>. Even junior employees might need to develop skills like determining how far into details to go or managing delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:19">[10:54:19]</a>.

AI is poised to automate much of the "anodyne, boring, repetitive, and clichéd" advice offered by top management consulting firms, making "McKenzie level advice" nearly free for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This will lead to many companies becoming "much smaller but still rather potent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

### Impact on Specific Traits and Talents
In his book *The Age of the Infovore*, Cowen discussed the value of traits associated with autism in the knowledge economy, such as ordering knowledge and remembering small bits of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:35">[14:39:39]</a>. He believes that in the short to medium term, AI "accelerates the value of those skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:18">[15:20:18]</a>, as individuals can leverage AI for enhanced learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:10">[15:29:10]</a>. However, in the very long run, if AI performs all the work, these skills might diminish in value, with "charisma and executive function" becoming more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

### AI's Role in Talent Evaluation
A future [[potential_future_developments_and_implications_of_ai_technologies | potential future development]] is using AI to evaluate people's talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. While this could lead to a highly meritocratic system and make it easier to find successful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:19">[09:15:19]</a>, Cowen questions if "we'll all be happy with it to be told just how good you are at something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, suggesting it might even diminish human happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## AI and Education

Cowen actively integrates AI into his teaching. He requires students in his "History of Economic Thought" class to subscribe to GPT-4, expecting it to be very effective for learning obscure history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>. In a previous class, he mandated that law students write one of their papers using GPT (not solely) to understand its limits and scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:00">[50:23:00]</a>.

He emphasizes responsible use, warning students against "plagiarizing" but encouraging them to "use it wisely and in a smart manner" to learn things about AI that he might not know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:00">[50:57:00]</a>. A notable benefit observed is foreign students, particularly from China, using AI to significantly improve their English writing skills, moving from the bottom 10% to the top 10% "overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>. This highlights AI's role in subtle "English to English" translations, bridging gaps in technical or professional fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>.

## Future of Economics and Human Behavior

In the next decade, Cowen does not believe AI will fundamentally alter the understanding of economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. However, at a more distant point, he foresees the possibility of simulating small economies using GPT-like methods, which could lead to significant learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

The evolution of AI, particularly LLMs, continues to shape predictions about the labor market and economic structures. While initially seen as an equalizer for skill gaps, the long-term outlook suggests a potential widening of the gap, favoring those with strong executive and project allocation abilities. The integration of AI into daily work and education, as demonstrated by Cowen, highlights its growing influence and the need for adaptive skills.

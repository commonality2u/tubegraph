The landscape of AI is seeing a significant shift towards specialized, "vertical" tools designed for particular tasks, moving beyond general-purpose AI models like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This evolution allows for more optimized and precise applications of AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## The Unbundling of General AI Tools
The current trend in AI mirrors the historical "unbundling" of general software like Excel, where specialized Software as a Service (SaaS) tools emerged to address specific needs that Excel was not optimally built for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Similarly, general-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT are creating opportunities for more targeted AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This "unbundling" is expected to fully materialize over the next 5 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

> [!info] The "Hallucination as a Feature" Concept
> For [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects|creative projects]], the ability of AI models to "hallucinate" or generate unexpected content can be a valuable feature rather than a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This allows users to explore and visualize concepts that might not otherwise exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Examples of Vertical AI Tools

### Design and Imagery: Midjourney
Midjourney has become a popular [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects|AI tool for design]], particularly for creating consistent visual styles and aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Its ability to generate repetitive styles makes it suitable for brand integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Internet Pipes Imagery** The "Internet Pipes" project utilized Midjourney to create visually distinct stations like "generation station" and "evaluation station" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:07]</a>. The developer found inspiration by scrolling the Midjourney homepage and exploring prompts to identify specific art styles like "blind box design" and "popular market style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This process helps users articulate their visual taste by seeing what kinds of prompts yield desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT for Analogies** ChatGPT can also be used for visualizing conceptual analogies, such as demonstrating the "baking of an idea" through a series of potato images that evolve from raw to ash to a "reincarnated baby potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

### Scientific Research: Consensus and Elicit
For [[knowledge_work_and_ai_tools|knowledge work]] and [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_tools|enhancing productivity]], tools like Consensus provide a specialized interface for searching and synthesizing scientific research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Consensus** allows users to ask research questions (e.g., "does fish oil prevent depression?") and receive a quick pulse on scientific consensus, showing the percentage of papers that agree or disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. It summarizes individual papers and provides study snapshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **Elicit** is another tool that allows users to "chat with the paper," offering a more conversational way to interact with research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

### Web Exploration and Simulation: Globe Explorer and Web Sim
These tools showcase how AI can augment web interaction and content creation:
*   **Globe Explorer** (globe.engineer) acts as a specialized search engine that interprets user queries, grouping results into categories like "absurd websites" or "unconventional databases," providing a more nuanced understanding of search intent than traditional search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Web Sim** (websim.ai) leverages language models to hallucinate and render entire web pages, including functional links and images, based on a user's prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This allows for the creation of "simulated internet" experiences, useful for creative or speculative purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### Productivity and Meeting Management: Granola
Granola is an example of a tool designed for [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_tools|enhancing productivity]] in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. It sits on a computer, records meetings, and allows users to take notes. Upon ending the meeting, it fills in and summarizes notes based on the transcript, and can extract action items and to-dos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

### Music Generation: Suno
Suno is an [[adaptive_use_of_ai_for_personal_and_creative_tasks|AI tool for creating music]] from text prompts, allowing users to define the style and even incorporate specific lyrical themes from a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Vertical AI Tools
Vertical AI tools offer several advantages:
*   **Precision and Optimization:** They are specifically optimized for certain tasks, leading to more precise and relevant outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Quality Experience:** These tools focus on delivering a "beautiful, high quality way" of performing tasks that AI can already do, making them more user-friendly and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.
*   **Unlocking New Opportunities:** By taking general AI capabilities and applying them to niche problems, these tools create new opportunities for [[building_applications_with_ai|building applications with AI]] and for creators to make things that were previously impossible or impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

The development of these specialized AI tools marks a significant step in the broader [[building_ai_applications_for_large_scale_use|application of AI]] across various domains, from [[using_ai_for_business_and_decision_making|business]] to [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship|entrepreneurship]].

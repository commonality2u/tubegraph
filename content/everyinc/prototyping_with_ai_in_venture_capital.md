At Union Square Ventures (USV), a leading venture capital firm, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for [[leveraging_ai_for_rapid_business_prototyping | rapid business prototyping]] and internal tool development has become a core function. This approach is driven by a philosophy of "tinkering" and making ideas tangible with available AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

## The Role of a "Tinkerer" in VC

Matt, an AI specialist at USV, describes his role as primarily [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | making prototypes with AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. He initially pursued this by following his own curiosity, creating "fake movie trailers" using Runway ML and ChatGPT to outline scripts and generate prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This self-driven experimentation led USV partners to offer him a full-time position dedicated to [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | deploying AI tools]] to enhance their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

The "spirit of tinkering" involves constantly playing with tools, making new things, and shipping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This environment fosters experimentation and fun, which is rewarded within the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Philosophy of AI Prototyping
A key philosophy is to "bring your ideas to life" because the tools are readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. AI allows individuals to:
*   **Learn alongside the creative process**: Users can develop skills while simultaneously seeing their creative ideas come to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   **Experience fast feedback loops**: The speed of AI in generating results makes the process highly rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   **Build immediately**: Instead of spending a long time on foundational elements (like learning basic programming before building an app), AI enables users to create a near-final product quickly, then learn the underlying details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. This approach mirrors the concept of taking something apart to understand how it works after it's been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

## Practical AI Tools at USV

USV leverages AI to enhance various aspects of their venture capital operations, reflecting [[the_changing_landscape_of_venture_capital_with_ai_advancements | the changing landscape of venture capital with AI advancements]].

### The Librarian GPT
The Librarian is a chatbot built on USV's 20-year history of published writings, including approximately 15,000 articles from partners and the USV blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Its initial purpose was to help partners avoid writing about topics they had already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

*   **Functionality**: Users can input information, such as an "about" page of a company, and the Librarian will extract relevant themes and provide links to USV's past writings that pertain to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing AI Limitations**:
    *   Initially, the bot would sometimes generate fake URLs for citations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Matt developed a "trick" to identify these (if the cursor remains a text-highlighting cursor instead of a hand pointer over a link, it's fake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.
    *   This highlights the need for human oversight; relying on AI to produce a final product without human intervention can lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use**: This tool helps USV demonstrate to entrepreneurs that their interest in a company is not merely "chasing the hot thing," but rather aligns with long-standing research and thesis development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. It provides "receipts" of their sustained interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.
*   **Evolution**: The Librarian was initially conceived as a monolithic "super app" but was broken down into individual, specific GPT agents for better functionality, with a standalone GPT called "The Librarian" for core functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. It's intended to become a public-facing tool, possibly integrated into USV's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Tracker GPT
This separate GPT categorizes USV's portfolio companies, including investment dates and ownership percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. It can generate charts plotting investments over time in specific sectors, like education, search, and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. While not directly sent to founders, it enables rapid internal analysis to contextualize potential investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>.

### AI for Internal Knowledge & Playbooks
USV uses AI to capture insights from internal meetings, especially for "sticky situations" that provide significant learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.
*   **Meeting Notes as Podcasts**: Transcriptions of key meetings are transformed into 10-15 minute podcasts, offering a convenient way for team members to stay informed while multi-tasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>. This addresses the common issue of repeating conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>.
*   **Developing Playbooks**: A project is underway to automatically identify and record "playbooks" for tricky situations discussed in meetings (e.g., a CEO stepping down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. These playbooks capture the firm's collective wisdom and approaches, which differ from other VC firms like Founders Fund, emphasizing the contextual nature of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>.
*   **Enhance, Not Replace**: USV's approach to AI is to "enhance, not replace" human relationships and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>. While AI can summarize ideas and identify patterns, direct human interaction with partners remains paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. The focus is on assisting companies and avoiding abstraction of critical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>.

### The Dream Machine: AI for Creative Expression
The "Dream Machine" is an art installation in the USV office that locally runs a visual diffusion model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. It connects to the Whisper API, listening to conversations and generating real-time moving images based on the spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   Developed by an artist known as Human, this machine is an example of a truly native AI artistic art form that could not exist before AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   It serves as a constant reminder to "bring your ideas to life" and make things, as the tools are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Business Operations

The use of AI within USV demonstrates the [[impact_of_ai_on_venture_capital_decisionmaking | impact of AI on venture capital decisionmaking]] and broader business.
*   **Democratizing Storytelling**: AI significantly reduces the cost of good storytelling, enabling high-quality narratives to be told about areas previously too expensive to capture, such as company meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>.
*   **Content Production**: Firms are producing "a ton of content" in their daily meetings that often goes uncaptured. AI helps curate and surface these valuable internal discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, allowing for earlier public communication of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Fractured Attention**: AI allows for creative and productive work with "divided attention," where tasks can be initiated and monitored intermittently, fitting into fragmented schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:38:00">[57:38:00]</a>.

### The Future of AI in VC

The goal is to develop more public-facing tools, such as the Librarian, which could allow potential founders to upload their pitch decks and receive relevant USV insights before meetings, fostering early alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>.

However, challenges remain, particularly regarding data control and accessibility. There's a strong belief that large tech companies should establish "data trusts" to make their vast datasets available for research and allow individuals to export their own data for use with AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This aligns with USV's long-standing thesis on "composable data" from Web3 applications, which aims to break data monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

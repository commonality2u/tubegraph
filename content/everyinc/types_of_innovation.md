Rory Sutherland, a renowned advertising executive, proposes three distinct types of innovation that can be observed in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These categories help to differentiate between incremental improvements, aspirational leaps, and unexpected delights.

## Rory Sutherland's Framework

According to Rory Sutherland, the three types of innovation are:

1.  **Faster Horses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>
2.  **Teleportation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
3.  **Japanese Toilets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

### Faster Horses
This type of innovation focuses on making an existing product or process perform better or more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. It's about optimizing what's already there rather than creating something fundamentally new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

In the context of the AI age, "Faster Horses" are often what get funded and emerge from the B2B SaaS industrial machine of venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. While these innovations are "fine," they risk being arbitraged out of existence within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. An example of a "Faster Horse" AI product is an AI notetaker like Fireflies, which some users actively avoid due to its interruptive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

### Teleportation
This category represents highly desirable, often seemingly impossible, future innovations that everyone wants to exist, even if the path to getting there is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It signifies a radical shift or a groundbreaking invention.

Examples include the idea of actual teleportation or establishing a colony on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. In venture capital, a company like Postmates (an early investor in Spark Capital) or Cruise (self-driving cars) initially presented as a "teleportation-like pitch" â€“ an amazing, perhaps impossible, vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>.

### Japanese Toilets
This refers to innovations that people didn't know they needed until they experienced them, after which they wonder how they ever lived without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. These are often subtle yet profound improvements that create entirely new, surprising experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The execution might be subtle but incredibly difficult to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.

For investors, identifying the "Japanese toilets of [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_technology_innovation | AI]]" means seeking mostly new experiences that surprise with their functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. Granola, an AI notetaker, is cited as a prime example of a "Japanese Toilet" innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. Despite being another AI notetaker in a crowded market, its intuitive design and seamless integration make it surprisingly indispensable, unlike more interruptive alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.

## Identifying and Cultivating "Japanese Toilet" Innovation

The creation of "Japanese Toilet" products requires a unique blend of sensitivity and kinetic energy in founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

Founders who create such innovations often:
*   **Tell insightful stories** about why specific product features were included, often derived from deep customer understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
*   **Pay attention to small details** that elevate the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.
*   **Listen closely to customer behavior** and self-reflect on their own user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. For example, the early version of Granola had a tab-complete feature that was distracting, leading to its removal in favor of a less interruptive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. This isn't just "brilliance" or "creativity" but rather an "investigation" and "sensitivity" to what's truly happening for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Possess a "proration to movement" while still listening** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. They move quickly but are not afraid to wander and explore, contrasting with founders who rely solely on horsepower to plow through problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Notable examples of founders exhibiting these traits include Andrew Mason (Descript), and the founders of Wordware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. Wordware, for instance, focuses on providing a blank document to users, allowing them to express their intentions in plain English, thereby fostering a deeper, more intentional interaction with the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This approach aims to make everyone a "maker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>, bridging the gap between writing and building by enabling software creation through prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:21">[02:19:21]</a>.

## Impact on Software Development and Startups

The ability to create products that fit the "Japanese Toilet" mold is heavily influenced by [[transformative_technologies_in_software_development | advancements in AI and coding agents]].

Key insights include:
*   **Faster Prototyping:** The ease of coding with AI allows for much quicker development and iteration cycles. It enables individuals and small teams to build multiple products and pursue diverse projects simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Agentic Workflows and "Leash Length":** The effectiveness of AI coding agents depends on how long they are allowed to work before seeking feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This "leash length" influences the UI/UX and overall product flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Replit agents are noted for striking a good balance, while some longer-leash models like Devon can be too slow or break often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This concept highlights [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_technology_innovation | challenges and opportunities in technology innovation]] related to AI's autonomy.
*   **Small, Highly Productive Teams:** AI enables smaller, more generalist teams (like an "eight-person, one-pizza company") to manage multiple products at a high level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This reshapes [[human_organizational_structure_and_ai_innovation | human organizational structure and AI innovation]], with individuals like product GMs handling everything from coding to release notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Shift from Craft to Art:** As AI automates the "craft" (execution) aspects of creation, human effort can focus more on the "art" (core decisions and unique insights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This is analogous to how graphic design shifted from hand-drawing letters to using software, allowing faster iteration on core design ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This phenomenon contributes to [[cultural_and_technological_evolution | cultural and technological evolution]].
*   **New Funding Models:** The reduced cost and time to build software challenge traditional [[the_influence_of_risk_profiles_and_innovation_in_aidriven_companies | funding models for software businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Finding Big Ideas:** The constant rapid advancement of AI models means startups must continually re-evaluate their products and be willing to "destroy their own startup" every six months to stay ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This emphasizes the dynamic nature of [[finding_big_ideas_in_tech | finding big ideas in tech]].
*   **Trust in AI:** Users and developers must develop techniques to verify AI's work, such as asking for confidence intervals or reasons for responses, especially in areas where subjective judgment is less critical than objective logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit Knowledge:** AI excels at applying thousands of nuanced, sub-symbolic rules in appropriate contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:55:00]</a>. However, there's a need for tools that can "pop up one altitude" and make implicit knowledge explicit, allowing users to choose from structured methodologies or "best practices" rather than just receiving a single, amalgamated AI answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This allows for more informed decision-making and empowers users to explore the "terrain of possibilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to leverage AI to solve "Faster Horses" problems, freeing up human creativity and attention for deeper, more transformative innovations that deliver new and surprising experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

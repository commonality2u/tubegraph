The "dirty little secret" of creative work is that it involves significant drudgery, especially when disseminating core content across multiple channels like X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, YouTube, and Spotify, which requires generating headlines and descriptions for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Spiral was developed to address this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## What is Spiral?
Spiral is a powerful prompt builder designed to help users start at 80% completion on repetitive writing, thinking, and decision-making tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It significantly reduces the time spent on mundane but necessary tasks, allowing creators to focus more on their core creative output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This contributes to [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_tools | enhancing productivity with AI tools]] and streamlining [[enhancing_the_writing_process_with_ai_tools | the writing process with AI tools]].

## Key Functionality and Use Cases
Spiral helps automate the conversion of content from one format to another, maintaining desired style and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This highlights its role in [[uses_of_spiral_in_content_creation | content creation]].

### Podcast Transcripts to Tweets
One specific application of Spiral is converting podcast transcripts into tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Instead of manually crafting tweets from scratch, a user can paste a transcript into a custom-built Spiral, press "run," and receive a ready-to-use tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For example, Spiral can generate a tweet with a strong hook, identifying key individuals and interesting ideas from the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This feature can generate viral content, requiring minimal editing from the user as Spiral provides the foundational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Articles to Headlines
Another use case is transforming articles into various headline suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A Spiral can be trained on an organization's top-performing headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. By pasting an article, the user can generate multiple headline suggestions based on content and what resonates with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. An example given is generating the headline "Language Models Explained for Humans" for an article, which was the exact headline used for the piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## How Spiral Works (Building a Custom Spiral)
The process of creating a custom Spiral involves several steps:
1.  **Define Conversion**: Specify the desired conversion, such as "podcast transcripts into tweets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  **Provide Examples**: Supply examples of previous outputs that demonstrate the desired style and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It's also necessary to provide input-output pairs (e.g., a transcript and the tweet that resulted from it) so the model can learn the specific conversion details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Extract Patterns**: The AI analyzes the provided examples to write a guide for itself on how to perform the conversion effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
4.  **Generate Form**: Once patterns are extracted, a user-friendly form is created for inputting new content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Customization and Sharing
Users have the ability to edit the full underlying prompt of any Spiral, allowing for extensive customization to fit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Spirals can also be shared publicly, with specific teams, or kept private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This flexibility makes it a powerful tool for individuals and content teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

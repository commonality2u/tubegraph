Economist and data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, author of "Who Makes the NBA," highlights the extraordinary influence of height on an individual's chances of reaching the National Basketball Association (NBA) and explores how [[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI in data analysis]] has transformed the ability to conduct such research rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>.

## Height as a Dominant Factor in NBA Success

Stephens-Davidowitz's research reveals that height is an unparalleled genetically determined trait for predicting success in the NBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:53">[06:58:53]</a>.

### The Doubling Relationship
For every inch taller a person is, their chances of making the NBA roughly double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>. This consistent relationship persists throughout the height distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:07">[06:31:07]</a>.
*   An individual under six feet tall has approximately a one in 3.8 billion chance of making the NBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:48">[06:44:48]</a>.
*   In contrast, someone over seven feet tall has roughly a one in seven chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:30">[06:51:30]</a>.

### Athleticism vs. Height
Tall players, especially those over seven feet, are often not exceptionally gifted athletes beyond their height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:07">[07:34:07]</a>. Their free throw percentages, for instance, might be similar to or even slightly worse than an average high schooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:17">[07:27:17]</a>. Their primary advantage is their sheer size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:56">[07:39:56]</a>. A six-foot player, however, must be a world-class athlete—a sprinter, a high-jumper, and an incredible shooter—to compete against millions of other men for an NBA spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

### The "Mugsies" Metric
To account for the overwhelming advantage of height, Stephens-Davidowitz developed a metric called "Mugsies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:04">[05:06:04]</a>. Named after Mugsy Bogues, the shortest NBA player in history (5'3"), this metric ranks players based on their performance adjusted for height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Mugsy Bogues ranks number one on this metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:07">[05:10:07]</a>.
The full backronym for Mugsies is: **M**etric for **U**nderstanding **G**ame **G**iven **S**porting **I**ndividuals **E**ffectiveness and **S**ize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

### Origin and Late Bloomers
For a seven-foot player, their country of origin or whether they played basketball from a young age is largely irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:02">[08:40:02]</a>. Many future Hall of Fame NBA players, such as Hakeem Olajuwon, Joel Embiid, Tim Duncan, and Patrick Ewing, did not start playing basketball until after age 12 or even 14 or 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:26">[09:02:26]</a>. Their enormous height, combined with reasonable athleticism, was sufficient to propel them to the NBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:09">[09:16:09]</a>. In contrast, players of average height (6'0" to 6'3") must grow up in regions that actively promote basketball to have a chance, as they are competing against millions of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:13">[09:28:13]</a>.

## Contrasting with Other Professions
Unlike the NBA, most other professional fields or pursuits require a complex mix of factors for success, rather than one dominant genetic trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:58">[09:56:58]</a>. For example, to become a president, one needs appearance, intelligence, social skills, height, connections, and more—a blend of genetic and trainable attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:41">[10:17:41]</a>.

## [[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI's Role in Sports Analytics]]

Stephens-Davidowitz attributes his ability to write "Who Makes the NBA" in just 30 days to the transformative power of [[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI in data analysis]], specifically tools like ChatGPT's Advanced Data Analysis (formerly Code Interpreter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

### Speed and Efficiency
Tasks that previously took months now take days or hours, significantly accelerating the research and writing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The ability to ask [[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI]] to download a dataset, run a regression, or generate charts instantly has been revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:26">[11:41:26]</a>.

### Eliminating Drudgery
[[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI]] handles the "annoying" and labor-intensive aspects of data analysis, such as merging datasets, cleaning data, and looking up coding syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. This allows the researcher to focus on asking interesting questions and interpreting results, transforming a previously frustrating process into a joyful, conversational one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:13">[14:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>.

### Interactive Data Exploration
[[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI]] enables rapid iteration and refinement of data visualizations. For example, quickly creating a histogram of NBA player heights, then refining it to show individual inches, filtering for American-born players, or adding specific labels and colors, all with simple conversational prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>. These small, instantaneous changes accumulate to tremendous time savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52:00">[41:52:00]</a>.

### Iterative Process
Working with [[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI]] for [[the_role_of_data_in_scientific_research | data analysis]] is an iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>. Initial outputs might not be perfect, requiring multiple rounds of refinement and clear instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. However, the speed of response makes this back-and-forth enjoyable and productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>. Errors from [[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI]] are often "glaringly obvious," making them easier to spot and correct compared to subtle human errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:20:00">[45:20:00]</a>.

### New Project Opportunities
[[advantages_of_ai_in_data_analysis | AI]] lowers the barrier to starting new projects and experiments that would have been too time-consuming or complex before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. This allows for rapid exploration of curiosities without the overhead of traditional coding setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>.

> "The act of getting answers [is] now energy-giving because you're just having a conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>

The ability to freely ask questions and get rapid responses makes research and creative work significantly more engaging and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.

From: [[everyinc]] <br/> 

Flashcards serve as a fundamental tool for knowledge retention and continuous learning, evolving alongside personal and technological advancements. The practice, particularly using tools like Anki, enables individuals to maintain a vast, retrievable knowledge base, even amidst demanding life circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Evolution of a Learning Machine

The interviewee, a co-founder of an AI startup, previously gained recognition for a viral article titled "how to make yourself into a learning machine" in 2020, which detailed his extensive reading habits, [[the_role_of_space_repetition_in_knowledge_retention | note-taking]], and flashcard creation from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Since 2020, his life has dramatically changed, running a demanding startup and welcoming a newborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This has led to a condensation of his learning rituals, with less time for extensive reading and writing about books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. However, the creation and review of flashcards have remained a constant habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## Current Flashcard Habits

The interviewee reviews between 50 and 200 flashcards every single day, aiming to reach 10,000 flashcards in his collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Flashcards are primarily a "sink" for knowledge, meaning new cards are created as information is encountered rather than in dedicated study sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

### Information Stored in Flashcards
Flashcards are used to retain a wide variety of information, ranging from practical facts to personal details and technical knowledge:
*   **Everyday Facts**: Examples include whether it's more efficient to drive with the window down or AC on at various speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, or the number of glasses of wine per bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Connections**: The interviewee uses flashcards to remember colleagues' children's names and ages, as well as significant life events like wedding dates, acknowledging his memory limitations for such details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:47]</a>.
*   **Technical Information**: When perusing technical documentation, specific details, such as the appropriate use cases for JSONB versus JSON column types in PostgreSQL, are added directly to flashcards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   **Vocabulary**: Flashcards are extensively used for learning new words, complete with example sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Historical/Cultural Knowledge**: Facts like the origin of every vegetable are also stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### The "Golden Card Type" Template
The interviewee has distilled his flashcard creation to a single, preferred template for Anki, suitable for almost any type of information:
*   **Front**: The question or prompt.
*   **Reverse Option**: A toggle to create a reverse card (e.g., if the front is "how many glasses of wine does Dan think is in a bottle?", the reverse might be "six glasses are in how many bottles?").
*   **Extra**: A field for additional context, like a picture.
*   **Source**: Always include the source of the information, which adds a layer of [[memory_and_environmental_cues_in_writing | nostalgia]] and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Beyond Rote Memorization
The act of reviewing flashcards is not merely about recalling facts. It also serves as a nostalgic and evocative exercise, akin to how a scent or song can trigger memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. The cards carry memories of *when* and *where* the information was first encountered, making the review process a personal journey through past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Flashcards in the AI Age

The advent of [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]] has significantly impacted the learning process, particularly in how information is acquired and processed for flashcards. While AI provides access to vast amounts of public human knowledge, personal retention through flashcards remains crucial for making real-time associations and engaging with knowledge on a deeper level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Leveraging AI for Flashcard Creation
[[strategies_for_enhancing_reading_skills_using_ai | AI]] is used to enrich the content of flashcards, especially for vocabulary:
*   **Raycast's "Define" Command**: A custom [[ai_as_a_tool_for_personalized_learning_and_development | AI command]] within Raycast allows for rapid, context-rich definitions of words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. When a word is encountered during reading, the "Define" command provides:
    *   A clear definition.
    *   Six example sentences, often incorporating historical, scientific, or geographical context to make the learning more educational and associative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
    *   Related words, synonyms, and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
    *   An option to generate an image for visual memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   This process makes looking up new words more engaging and effective, as the [[role_of_space_and_memory_in_creative_thinking | AI]] helps connect new information to existing "trunks of knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Complementary Roles of Flashcards and AI
*   AI, particularly large language models, acts as an "average of the internet," providing associations and creative prompts for exploration (e.g., brainstorming product brands or construction methods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   Flashcards, by contrast, ensure personal retention and ready retrieval of specific facts, enabling individuals to quickly make high-bandwidth associations in real-time conversations or problem-solving scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   For instance, when dealing with legal or accounting professionals, AI can help draft initial paragraphs or explain technical terms, which then can be condensed into flashcards for long-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Future Potential
The integration of AI with visual learning environments like VR and AR holds exciting potential for enhancing memory. The ability to visualize concepts directly, as hinted at by [[the_impact_of_physical_versus_digital_books_on_memory_retention | AI-generated imagery]] for words, could make learning even more profound and unforgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This shift suggests a future where technology doesn't replace human cognition but augments it, allowing for new forms of human flourishing and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

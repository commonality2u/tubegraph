The democratizing effect of [[AI in film production | AI]] is not unique to film. It has also been observed in software development, where [[AI tools]] have dramatically expanded the number of people capable of building software by programming for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This parallel suggests a broader trend where AI lowers the entry barrier across various creative and technical fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Virtual reality (VR) has experienced a surprisingly slow path to widespread adoption, despite early promise and significant technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Early Impressions and Persistent Challenges

In 1987, [[Jaron Lanier | Jaron Lanier]] demonstrated VR technology, which was described as "completely blown away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. At that time, it was perceived as "the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, the core VR experience today is not significantly different from what was available decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The primary change has been a dramatic reduction in cost, from multi-million dollars to around $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The slow progress of VR has been a source of surprise, as it was expected to take off much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. One key factor contributing to this slowness is its reliance on "biology" and interaction with the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. Challenges include the need for precise eye focusing and the physical weight of the headset on the user's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. This integration of hardware and biological factors inherently slows down development compared to purely digital advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

## Comparison to [[the_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] and Robotics

The journey of VR is often compared to the [[the_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | evolution of artificial intelligence]]. While [[the_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] took 50 years to become an "overnight success" with its "LLM moment" (referring to Large Language Models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>, VR is "still waiting for its LLM moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. This suggests that VR may require a similar technical breakthrough in areas like lenses, focusing, or projection, potentially originating from an unexpected source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

Similarly, the challenges faced by VR in integrating with human physiology suggest that the widespread arrival of robots will also take significantly longer than many anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. The efficiency of the human body (a 25-watt supercomputer and a quarter-horsepower engine) poses a huge gap in power and efficiency for current robotic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. This highlights that technologies requiring close physical or biological interaction tend to progress more slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

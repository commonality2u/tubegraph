Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, an American data scientist, economist, and author, leveraged [[The role of ChatGPT in learning and research | ChatGPT]] to write his book *Who Makes the NBA* in just 30 days, a process he described as "the best month of my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This rapid creation was possible due to the transformative power of [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] and its Advanced Data Analysis tool (formerly Code Interpreter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Transforming the Writing Process

Stephens-Davidowitz found that [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] drastically accelerated his workflow, turning tasks that once took months into days or hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He noted that the AI handled "everything that was annoying" in the creative process, allowing him to focus on asking interesting questions of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This shift eliminated the drudgery associated with data analysis and coding, making the work enjoyable and leading to sustained productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## [[ChatGPT as a problemsolving tool for coding | Advanced Data Analysis]] in Action

The primary impact of [[ChatGPT as a problemsolving tool for coding | ChatGPT]] on Stephens-Davidowitz's work was its ability to perform advanced data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The tool allowed him to directly communicate requests to the AI, which would then write and execute Python code, return results, generate charts, and even merge data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Automating Data Visualization
One significant time-saver was the instantaneous creation of charts and graphs. For example, he requested a chart showing where NBA players went to college, and [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] not only generated it but also colored each college according to its official school colors, like Michigan State's green or Duke's dark blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

He also used it to create:
*   **Histograms of NBA player heights**: Initially, it grouped heights, but with further prompts, it refined the chart to show individual inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a> and even filtered for American-born players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
*   **Word clouds of NBA player names**: To analyze name demographics, he asked for a word cloud of first names, specifying years and excluding initials. The AI handled data cleaning (separating first/last names) and customization, such as making the most common name ("Chris") horizontal for better prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

The iterative nature of prompting allowed him to refine visualizations, changing colors, removing lines, and adjusting labels with immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. This process of rapidly iterating and visualizing data helped him figure out what he wanted the charts to look like in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Iterative Prompting and Error Detection
Stephens-Davidowitz emphasizes that [[Overcoming the limitations of ChatGPT for effective usage | ChatGPT]] is a tool requiring a conversational, back-and-forth approach, not a one-shot solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. He found that [[Overcoming the limitations of ChatGPT for effective usage | ChatGPT's]] mistakes, especially in data manipulation like merging data sets, tend to be "really glaring obvious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>, making them easier to spot and correct through further prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

## Beyond Data: [[ChatGPT in writing and content creation | Creativity and Auxiliary Tasks]]

[[ChatGPT in writing and content creation | ChatGPT]] assisted with more than just data visualization:
*   **Backronyms**: Stephens-Davidowitz used [[ChatGPT in writing and content creation | ChatGPT]] to generate a backronym for his height-adjusted basketball metric "Mugsy" (Metric for Understanding Game Given Sporting Individuals Effectiveness and Size), which he found "mind-blowingly good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This demonstrated [[ChatGPT's ability to help with creative, linguistic tasks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Image Generation**: For the book's art, he used tools like Midjourney and DALL-E, allowing him to express visual ideas (e.g., a DNA strand dribbling a basketball) without having artistic talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This represents a significant shift, as it "gives you skills that you don't have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The use of [[The role of ChatGPT in learning and research | ChatGPT]] lowers the barrier to entry for new projects and experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. What previously required hours of setup (e.g., coding a basic app) can now be done in minutes with simple prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. This efficiency means that humans can focus on asking the right questions, rather than the tedious process of finding answers or implementing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

> [!info] The "Question-Asking" Skill
> "The real skill or the really interesting thing is knowing which questions to ask." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a> Stephens-Davidowitz noted that while [[ChatGPT as a problemsolving tool for coding | ChatGPT]] is excellent at answering, it's not as good at *generating* questions, preserving a crucial human role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

The experience of using [[ChatGPT as a problemsolving tool for coding | Advanced Data Analysis]] fundamentally changed his perception of coding, transforming it from a "laborious, unfund conversation" to a "fun conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. This shift in enjoyment allowed him to work for much longer periods, directly contributing to the book's rapid completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

## Live Data Exploration: Olympic Athletes

During a live demonstration using a dataset of Olympic athletes, Stephens-Davidowitz and the host explored how to determine which sport would offer the best chance of medaling for someone of the host's height, weight, and country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

> [!info] Process demonstrated:
> 1.  **Initial Query**: "What sport would give me the best chance of success?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>
> 2.  **Data Ingestion and Conversion**: [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] automatically ingested the dataset and converted the host's height and weight to centimeters and kilograms to match the data format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.
> 3.  **Initial Analysis (and refinement)**: The AI first found the number of athletes within a tolerance range for the host's dimensions for each sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Realizing this overweighted sports with more athletes, Stephens-Davidowitz prompted it to divide by the total number of athletes in that sport to get a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.
> 4.  **Tolerance Adjustment**: The tolerance range for height was narrowed from 5cm to 2cm for more precise results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.
> 5.  **Filtering by Country**: The analysis was further refined to include only USA athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>.
> 6.  **Addressing Data Redundancy**: It was discovered that athletes appearing in multiple Olympics created duplicate entries. A prompt was used to include each athlete only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.
> 7.  **Result Interpretation**: The analysis revealed that modern pentathlon, canoeing, and table tennis showed high percentages of athletes matching the host's physical profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

This live demonstration highlighted how [[Using ChatGPT for decision making and research | ChatGPT]] allows for rapid, iterative data exploration and problem-solving that would be time-consuming or prohibitive with traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Stephens-Davidowitz is exploring how to monetize this new, hyper-efficient writing process, considering whether to write more books in the series (e.g., "Who Makes the NFL," "Who Makes the Olympics") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. The shift in publishing economics, where self-published books offer a higher per-copy royalty, makes advertising a potentially viable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. Despite the financial uncertainties of traditional publishing, he remains drawn to the passion and joy that [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use | AI-assisted creative work]] provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

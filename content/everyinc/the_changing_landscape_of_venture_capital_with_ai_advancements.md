Mike Maples Jr., a legendary investor at Floodgate and author of *Pattern Breakers*, highlights how [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_models_and_investment | AI advancements]] are fundamentally reshaping not just business models but also the very nature of company building and [[impact_of_ai_on_venture_capital_decisionmaking | venture capital decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## AI as a "Sea Change"

Maples emphasizes the power of "inflections" – moments that allow a startup to wage "asymmetric warfare" on the present and offer something radically different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. AI represents a "sea change," akin to the advent of the personal computer or mass connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Historically, such shifts inverted assumptions about business:
*   **Personal Computing (1980s)**: Made computation "asymptotically free" and ubiquitous, leading to the rise of software licensing models (e.g., Oracle, Microsoft, SAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Mass Connectivity (1990s onward, extended by iPhone)**: Made communications bandwidth free, fostering new models like subscription (SaaS) and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Each "sea change" makes certain business models more attractive and others less so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Startups benefit from [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_models_and_investment | counter positioning]] against incumbents, exploiting new business model opportunities that disorient established players and discourage retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Impact on Startup Business Models

### Counter Positioning and Outcome-Based Pricing
[[The_impact_of_ai_on_business_models_and_investment | Counter positioning]] is a powerful insight for startups, extending beyond just the product ("what") to the delivery ("how") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. AI facilitates a shift from traditional software pricing (per-seat, subscription) to outcome-based or "pay-for-performance" models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

An example is Text IQ, a company that used AI to replace labor-intensive legal document discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Instead of charging per software license or seat, Text IQ offered to process all documents and return only the discoverable ones with higher accuracy at a fraction of the cost previously spent on human outsourcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This directly competed with "labor cost buckets" rather than "software spend buckets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

This outcome-based approach is "very unappealing" for traditional SaaS vendors whose entire culture and investor expectations are built around subscription models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This strategic shift allows startups to [[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | counter position]] against incumbents who cannot easily change their deeply embedded business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Counter Positioning Against Major AI Players
Startups also need to [[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | counter position]] against major AI players like OpenAI, which is transitioning from an API developer tool to a product company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. One strategy involves focusing on deep, multidisciplinary expertise in a specific process that traditional AI wrappers might not adequately cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Applied Intuition, for example, creates simulation software for autonomous vehicles. They leverage AI expertise combined with intimate knowledge of automotive manufacturing, testing, and supply chains, which major car companies lack internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This allows them to secure "giant contracts" by providing an existential solution that large companies cannot easily replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Integrated vs. Modular Solutions
Drawing on Clayton Christensen's "conservation of attractive profits" theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>, AI companies must consider whether to pursue an integrated or modular solution:
*   **Integrated Solutions**: Rewarded in early markets where products are "never quite good enough" and customers pay for incremental performance (e.g., early Silicon Graphics for film rendering, or Tesla building its entire software-defined car architecture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.
*   **Modular Components**: Emerge when performance is "mostly good enough," allowing suppliers to offer swappable, cost-effective components (e.g., Nvidia with commoditized GPUs, Twilio providing messaging APIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

The key question for AI startups is: under what conditions are you advantaged by being integrated versus modular? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a> In the current AI landscape, there is a strong demand for enhanced performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>, suggesting opportunities for integrated solutions that truly "ring the bell" by solving a job to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Impact on Building Companies and the Venture Capital Model

### Cheaper Software Development and Funding Implications
[[Challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_startups | AI advancements]] have made software "orders of magnitude cheaper to make" than a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This collapse in development cost, similar to the LAMP stack era, profoundly changes dynamics:
*   **Individual Empowerment**: Tools like Chat PRD allow one person to hold the "entire idea premise of the product" without needing a giant team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Profitability**: Tiny companies can generate significant revenue and be "wildly efficient and profitable" without needing substantial [[venture_capital_decisionmaking_and_ai | VC funding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

### Digital Darwinism and Adaptive Software
The way software is built is also changing. Maples calls this "Darwinian engineering" or "digital Darwinism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This means a shift from traditional waterfall or agile development to continuous adaptation, where software elements are "adaptive by design" and can sense and respond to real-world inputs autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. The role of a product builder becomes more like a "gardener" setting conditions for growth, rather than a "sculptor" meticulously crafting every piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>.

This new paradigm rewards "systems level thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>, where product managers consider emergent properties within an ecosystem, rather than just building discrete features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

### AI's Role in Venture Capital Decision-Making
[[Impact_of_ai_on_venture_capital_decisionmaking | AI is transforming]] how investors [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | evaluate startups]]. Maples is developing "Atomic eggs" – a system that allows uploading a pitch deck and running generative AI models against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. This system can:
*   Identify the fundamental insight and non-consensus aspects of a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   Analyze inflections being harnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   Apply established frameworks like Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers or Clay Christensen's Jobs to Be Done to assess primary power and primary job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.
*   Identify patterns in founders and company growth metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

This enables investors to act on their curiosity in real-time, rapidly testing ideas and backtesting theories against historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. AI helps refine mental models, highlighting boundary conditions and improving decision-making beyond what was previously possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. This shift empowers investors to quickly identify whether a pitch is "wacky and good" or needs more investigation, rather than having to predict long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

Ultimately, Maples seeks to spend time with "AI natives" – individuals whose entire lived business experience involves [[prototyping_with_ai_in_venture_capital | programming AI assistance]] as a core function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. These individuals intuitively operate in a "polar coordinates" world, unlike those who must unlearn older "Cartesian" approaches, giving them a natural advantage in the evolving AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

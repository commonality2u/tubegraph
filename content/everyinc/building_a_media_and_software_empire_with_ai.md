Every, initially conceived as a writer collective, has evolved into a multifaceted media and software company, strategically integrating AI-powered products into its core business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:18">[02:16:18]</a>. This transformation stems from a desire to combine high-quality business and technology content with innovative software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:18">[02:16:18]</a>.

## From Newsletter to Writer Collective
Dan Shipper, the co-founder of Every, initially started a newsletter called Superorganizers in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>. His goal was to interview interesting people about their note-taking and productivity systems, use the insights to write a newsletter, and eventually build a software product for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>. He found himself enjoying the newsletter aspect so much that it became the primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:56">[03:53:56]</a>.

In collaboration with Nathan, Every's co-founder and former first employee at Substack, they envisioned a media company for the "new internet age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:58">[03:57:58]</a>. They observed a trend of writers "unbundling" from traditional publications to start their own Substack newsletters, gaining significant financial upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:58">[03:57:58]</a>. However, this came with drawbacks: loss of camaraderie, editorial support, and the burden of running a business solo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:58">[03:57:58]</a>. For readers, it meant paying individually for each writer, limiting content variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:58">[03:57:58]</a>.

Their solution was to create a bundle of business newsletters, offering a single subscription to access various writers while providing collective benefits like editorial support and shared infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:58">[03:57:58]</a>.

## Challenges of the Writer Collective Model
The collective model faced significant hurdles:
*   **Scarcity of Writers**: Finding business writers who are knowledgeable, skilled, consistent, and willing to write regularly is extremely rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:11">[04:04:11]</a>. Many talented business professionals can earn significantly more in other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:50">[04:08:50]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit Dependence**: Unlike software, where founders build an initial product and then hire others to scale, in media, changing a writer can lead to a loss of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:34">[04:31:34]</a>.
*   **Bundle Economics Complexity**: Figuring out how to fairly compensate writers within a bundle proved to be a "mess" and led to complications and dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:58">[04:56:58]</a>.

These challenges led Dan to realize that the scalable collective idea was not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:58">[04:56:58]</a>. The business stagnated despite efforts to hire more writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:17">[04:15:17]</a>.

## Pivot to Media and Software Integration
A significant turning point came when Nathan built Lex, an AI-powered word processor, which went viral and was spun out as a separate business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This highlighted the potential for integrating software products with Every's content platform. Dan also realized he needed to return to his core strength: writing and being the main writer for Every <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This embrace of doing what he was good at, rather than what he was "supposed to do" as a CEO, became a key philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Brandon's Arrival and the New Vision
Brandon, a long-time Every subscriber and experienced entrepreneur who sold his own company (Clyde, an insurance technology firm) at 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, joined Every as its first entrepreneur-in-residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Brandon's background included a love for building things since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, experience in architecture, emphasizing iterative design and problem identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>, and a knack for identifying unmet needs in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.

Brandon's email to Dan laid out a vision based on three pillars:
1.  **Consulting**: Leveraging Every's expertise in AI and business to help companies with training, product selection, and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>. This would also serve as a funding source for other initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>.
2.  **Product Studio**: Building a profit-driven studio focused on creating tools, potentially for "billion-dollar solopreneurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>.
3.  **Investing**: Investing in companies, leveraging Every's network and understanding of the founder journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>.

This strategic alignment led to a rapid acceleration in Every's growth and product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.

## [[building_applications_with_AI | AI-Powered Product Studio]]
Every's product studio has launched two notable AI products:

*   **Spiral**: An AI-powered prompt builder designed to automate creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>. It transforms long-form content, such as podcast transcripts, into concise outputs like tweets or LinkedIn posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. Dan uses it weekly to generate tweets for his podcast, reducing a one-hour task to mere seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. Spiral is an "AI wrapper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a> â€“ it provides a structured, easy-to-use interface for complex AI tasks that would otherwise require cumbersome manual prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>. This makes AI more accessible to users who might not directly engage with general-purpose AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>.
*   **Sparkle**: An AI file cleaner that organizes desktop, downloads, and documents folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. It moves files into an "AI library" where they are magically organized, making obscure files easy to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:11">[01:52:11]</a>. Sparkle aims to be a product that delivers continuous value without requiring user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>.

This approach reflects the idea that while general-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT are powerful, specialized tools built on top of them (like Excel spawned the B2B SaaS wave) make AI more practical and accessible for specific workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:09">[01:46:09]</a>.

## The "Pyramid" Business Model
Every's current business model is structured like a pyramid, designed for sustainability and high-quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:14">[01:30:14]</a>:

*   **Bottom Layer: Free Content**: High-quality writing and podcasts serve as the entry point, attracting a broad audience and introducing them to Every <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>.
*   **Mid-Layer: Paid Subscription**: The core $20/month subscription bundles all writing, behind-the-scenes content, discounts on courses, and access to all software products like Spiral, Sparkle, and Lex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.
*   **Upper Layer: Training, Consulting, Courses**: Fewer people engage at this level, but they pay significantly more for specialized services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>.
*   **Top Layer: Speaking/Advising**: The most exclusive and expensive services, catering to an even smaller audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>.

This model allows Every to funnel revenue from the top of the pyramid down to support the creation of free content and the development of new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. It emphasizes serving different audience segments with varying needs and willingness to pay, contrasting with the typical Silicon Valley tech business model that focuses on a single revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>.

## Culture and Future
Every prioritizes building "calm businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>, fostering a creative playground where people can do their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>. The company values high-quality output, aiming for every product and piece of content to be valuable and well-crafted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. Despite a fast pace of development, they avoid external pressures from large funding rounds and rapid hiring, maintaining a tight-knit team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

Every's journey reflects a belief that in an era where intelligence is cheap (due to AI), distribution and unique products built on that intelligence are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. They aim to continue developing high-quality content and innovative AI-powered tools that solve real problems for their audience, maintaining a sustainable and enjoyable creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>. Every is actively looking for more [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurs in residence]] to help [[building_an_ai_app_from_scratch | build applications with AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

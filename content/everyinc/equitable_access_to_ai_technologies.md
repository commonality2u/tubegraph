Equitable access to new technologies is considered an important agency-preserving approach when facing technological advancements like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

## Importance of Equitable Access
Bringing as many people along in society and ensuring that benefits are not exclusive to wealthy individuals or companies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. When AI is in the hands of more people, it offers a better chance for fair and just participation in new jobs and career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. This broad access also benefits society as a whole by unlocking talent from a wider range of people, leading to creativity and maximum societal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Therefore, equitable access is not just about fairness but also about collective societal improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

## Private Commons and Data Ownership
The concept of "private commons" refers to the accumulation of personal data, for example, on platforms like Facebook and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. This data becomes significantly more valuable to individuals when they can use AI to analyze it and identify patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.

The framing of this interaction matters: instead of viewing it solely as "surveillance capitalism," it can be seen as building a private commons that benefits and enables the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. For instance, Google Maps allows friends to find your house, enabling social connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>. These data commons contribute to "super agency" by enabling automatic tagging on pictures, facilitating human connectivity, and enriching lives with better decision-making capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

While corporations generally have pro-social incentives to build features that engage users and store data, there's a need to ensure individual rights over this data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. This includes the right to move one's data as desired, which companies should facilitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

## AI as a Capability Amplifier
AI can reduce the cost of certain "intelligence services" that people currently pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. This means that individuals who cannot afford human experts (e.g., a ghostwriter for YouTube headlines or marketing copy) can use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to achieve similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This effectively lowers the barrier to entry, giving those with fewer resources access to leverage previously available only to those with more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

This amplification of intelligence raises the bar for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. Individuals who lack access to formal education (e.g., law school) can still learn, and even professionals who already use advanced tools (like a talented ghostwriter) can further enhance their capabilities by incorporating AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. Amplifying capabilities across the board is seen as a beneficial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.

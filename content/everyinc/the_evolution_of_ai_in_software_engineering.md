The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically reshaped the landscape of software engineering, making the process of building applications faster and more accessible than ever before. This shift is evident in how quickly sophisticated products can be developed and the changing roles of engineers themselves.

## Accelerated Development with AI

The speed at which software can be brought to life using AI tools is unprecedented. For instance, the initial functioning version of Kora, an email management product, was developed in just one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>, and the entire product was built end-to-end in about three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:27">[06:05:27]</a>. This rapid prototyping and development cycle is a direct result of AI's capabilities.

AI now allows developers to build a rough version of almost any software in a couple of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:27">[08:36:27]</a>. This drastically reduces the cost and time historically associated with software development, making the crucial question not *how* to build, but *what* to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:27">[08:32:27]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Programming Assistance

AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), acts as a powerful collaborator in coding, handling tedious tasks and accelerating development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:27">[11:55:27]</a>. For example, Kieran, the GM of Kora, notes that 80% to 90% of Kora's code was written by AI, though 100% of it was conceptualized by him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:27">[11:41:27]</a>.

The process often starts with a detailed verbal prompt, which is then transcribed and fed into an LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:27">[10:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:27">[10:35:27]</a>. Tools like Cursor Composer and Wind Surf are integral, as they can set up development environments, install dependencies, and automatically fix errors encountered during the process, saving significant time on debugging and Googling solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:27">[31:13:27]</a>.

### The Evolution of GitHub Copilot and AI Coding Tools

Early AI coding tools, such as the initial concept for Kora, focused on drafting emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:43">[06:40:43]</a>. However, it was quickly realized that LLMs often lack the specific context of a human's brain, making them unsuitable for drafting about 50% of necessary email responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:27">[07:02:27]</a>. This led to a pivot towards AI managing the "cognitive load" of email, reducing stress and archiving non-essential messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:27">[07:33:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:27">[07:50:27]</a>.

The functionality of tools like Cursor Composer has expanded beyond basic code generation. They can now interact with the file system, manage project dependencies, and resolve errors autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:27">[31:13:27]</a>. This allows developers to focus on higher-level problem definition rather than low-level code mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:27">[33:01:27]</a>.

### Prompt Engineering and Architectural Clarity

Despite some talk of "prompt engineering" dying out, the ability to clearly articulate a desired outcome and its stylistic details to an AI is not going away; it remains crucial for effective AI utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:27">[22:56:27]</a>.

Kieran's process involves extensive verbal outlining of ideas and app visualizations before generating code, ensuring the AI has a clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:27">[20:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:27">[20:50:27]</a>. This foundational clarity is key, as issues with AI-generated code often stem from an unclear problem definition or lack of architectural structure from the human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25:27">[36:25:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:06:27">[37:06:27]</a>. Developers can use `.cursor_rules` files to consistently apply architectural decisions and style guides across a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:27">[38:46:27]</a>.

## The Changing Role of the Software Engineer

The shift from manual coding to AI-assisted development transforms the role of the software engineer. Programmers are becoming more akin to writers or composers, focusing on the "story" or user experience of the software rather than just problem-solving through code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:27">[12:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:27">[13:12:27]</a>. This means cultivating taste, vision, and creativity, as building something that makes a user "feel a thing" becomes paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:27">[15:00:27]</a>.

This change also implies a shift from a "knowledge economy" to an "allocation economy," where the skill lies in effectively allocating intelligence (AI) to tasks, similar to how human managers delegate work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:27">[34:34:27]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

While AI streamlines development, building successful AI products still involves navigating complex challenges. One challenge is avoiding self-bias when developing a product for personal use, which can obscure real user problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:27">[53:53:27]</a>. Manual onboarding of initial users helps gather critical, unbiased feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:29:27">[54:29:27]</a>.

Another aspect is the "mushiness" of real-world problems. Unlike clear-cut coding or math problems, many human challenges are not easily reducible to step-by-step verifiable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. This is where human taste, intuition, and pattern matching remain crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.

The [[Future of AI and AGI development | evolution of artificial intelligence]] is often perceived in terms of "false peaks" â€“ where reaching one level of capability reveals even greater complexity and new frontiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. As AI continues to advance, including the potential for [[Future of AI and AGI development | AGI]] in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>, it will likely expand the scope of human knowledge and creativity rather than diminish it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. The [[Future Vision of AI in Software Engineering | future vision of AI in software engineering]] is one where AI tools enhance human capabilities, allowing people to focus on meaningful interactions and higher-level design. For example, Kora filters out automated emails, leaving only human-generated messages in the inbox, allowing users to focus on what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>.

Investing in the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and stablecoins presents unique [[the_changing_landscape_of_venture_capital_with_ai_advancements | challenges and opportunities]]. This article explores current trends, strategic approaches to investment, and the potential future landscape of these technologies.

## AI Investment and Product Evolution

Historically, successful technology companies like Google were founded by deeply technical teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Google's strength lay in its complex back-end magic that simplified a complex service for the user, with its founding team being approximately 95% deeply technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. As underlying technology matured, the emphasis shifted from deep technical expertise to product genius, exemplified by companies like Pinterest, Snap, and Instagram, whose CEOs were product-focused rather than technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

The initial major consumer success in [[use_of_ai_in_writing_and_investment | AI]] is [[use_of_ai_in_writing_and_investment | Chat GPT]], which shares similarities with early Google in its text-box interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Companies like Character AI also represent a new paradigm, but their products are still predominantly backend-driven (around 94%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This indicates that the [[the_challenges_and_potential_benefits_of_ai_development_and_regulation | AI]] space is still early, requiring more stable underlying infrastructure before product-centric intuition can fully shape user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

A parallel can be drawn between OpenAI, a research lab that "accidentally" built a major consumer product, and Google's technical DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Investing in PhDs doing long-term research is not a typical venture capital strategy, but it can be highly successful when dealing with a truly new technology paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities in AI Product Development

Current [[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | AI products]], such as Chat GPT, are often difficult for general users to master, requiring specific custom instructions to achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. While models are improving and becoming easier to use, the focus remains largely on single-player modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

A significant opportunity lies in developing multiplayer, network effect-driven [[strategic_growth_and_monetization_in_ai_startups | AI experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>. This could involve User-Generated Content (UGC) communities where skilled users create and share prompts, making [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] more accessible for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Examples include:

*   **AI friends/companions:** The potential for dedicated platforms where individuals have conversations with [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] companions, distinct from knowledge-focused services like Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. This could bifurcate into "personal" and "work" [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.
*   **Prompt libraries/social networks:** While early attempts at prompt libraries were premature, there's a "second life" opportunity for platforms where users can easily discover and apply prompts from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:10]</a>. Key challenges here include building trust and ensuring continuous engagement beyond one-off prompt sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.

The vision is for a new interface that democratizes [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] usage, moving beyond power users to allow broader access to [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_models_and_investment | AI]]'s full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. This could lead to specialized [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] platforms that eventually cannibalize general-purpose tools like Chat GPT for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.

A significant challenge is the "gravitational pull" of existing dominant platforms like Chat GPT, which have established user habits and ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>. New companies must offer compelling reasons for power users to migrate and share their expertise on new platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:00]</a>.

## Investing in a Hype Cycle

In periods of high hype and inflated prices for new technologies (e.g., social networks, B2B SaaS, crypto, [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]]), the investment strategy shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.

### Founder Qualities

Investors prioritize partnering with teams that demonstrate:

*   **Unlimited potential:** Companies with a broad scope beyond a "cul-de-sac" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic thinking:** Founders who deeply understand network effects, competitive escape, and long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>.
*   **Calling/Affliction:** A deep, almost obsessive drive for their mission, rather than just viewing it as a "cool new job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>.
*   **Learning machine mindset:** Founders who prioritize continuous learning and evolving for the company's best interest over ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.

Experienced investors look for genuine curiosity and proactive thinking in founders, indicating they've "been through the maze" of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>. The ideal founder is someone who is already addressing potential future issues before an investor even brings them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.

### Network Effects

True network effects are rare, often misrepresented in pitch decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. Key indicators include:

*   **Early evidence of tipping points:** Seeing initial, organic growth in a small, "white-hot center" of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>.
*   **Accelerating flywheels:** The "words on a slide" must translate into actual accelerants for the business, not just abstract concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.
*   **Low friction:** The absence of significant friction or offshoots in any part of the proposed flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>.

While many recent [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] businesses focus on single-player models and performance gains through compute and data, the next wave of consumer-focused [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] applications is expected to differentiate through network effects and multiplayer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Stablecoins

Beyond [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]], stablecoins present a compelling investment opportunity, particularly in their ability to overcome friction in traditional financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a>.

*   **Global accessibility:** In countries with unstable local currencies (e.g., Argentina), there's a strong demand for the US dollar, which is often difficult to acquire due to government restrictions and complex exchange processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:26:00">[36:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:00">[37:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** US dollar-backed stablecoins like Tether and USDC offer a 24/7, cheaper, and faster medium of exchange for international trade and peer-to-peer transactions, circumventing multiple intermediaries and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20:00">[37:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[38:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>.
*   **Network effects:** Stablecoins, particularly dominant ones like Tether, benefit from network effects due to their liquidity across exchanges, making them easier to use and more comfortable for a wider ecosystem of crypto wallets and financial apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:14:00">[40:14:00]</a>.

## The Future of VC with AI

[[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_models_and_investment | AI]] is expected to transform the venture capital landscape. One potential area is the use of [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] to improve [[challenges_and_considerations_in_stock_trading_using_ai | decision-making]]. By analyzing training data like past investment decisions, interview notes, and talent tracking, [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] could help VCs identify patterns, cross-examine their thinking, and even surface new opportunities through a "Rotten Tomatoes" like scoring system for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:09:00">[43:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>.

However, a challenge in VC is that the landscape frequently changes, making it difficult to rely solely on past training data for future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:38:00">[45:38:00]</a>. While [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | AI]] won't provide definitive "yes or no" answers, it can serve as a valuable tool to probe and refine a VC's thinking, ensuring they remain the ultimate deciders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12:00">[47:12:00]</a>. The role of a VC will likely become very different, even if the core principles remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>.

ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for discovering new books and authors, offering a more tailored and efficient experience compared to traditional methods like Google or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. It excels at surfacing specific recommendations that might be difficult to find through conventional searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Tailored Book Recommendations

One primary use case for ChatGPT is getting highly specific book recommendations based on nuanced preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Intersection of Tastes** You can ask ChatGPT to identify authors who would be at the intersection of several favorite books, for example, "My favorite sci-fi books are *The Three-Body Problem*, *Jurassic Park*, and *The Martian*. Who's an author that would be at a really good intersection of those three?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The "Machine Hood" book was identified this way on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Specific Genre/Style Queries** Users can query for niche subgenres or styles, such as "Is there anyone today writing great near-term hard sci-fi science fiction without involving space like Michael Crichton?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This helps to filter for contemporary authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. ChatGPT can then provide additional recommendations upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Beyond Traditional Search

ChatGPT offers several advantages over asking for recommendations on platforms like Reddit or Twitter, or using Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>:
*   **Speed and Specificity** It provides answers much faster than waiting for responses on Reddit or Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It can filter information and create lists based on specific, unique criteria that might not exist in pre-composed lists found on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Overcoming SEO Bias** Traditional search results are often "best engineered" for search engine optimization, not necessarily the best answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. ChatGPT can help surface good information that isn't just well-engineered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Browsing vs. Hallucination** When ChatGPT uses web browsing, the quality of its search results heavily impacts the response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Asking it *not* to use web browsing might yield different results, potentially more creative but with a higher chance of "hallucinating" or recommending non-existent authors or books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Understanding Your Own Taste

ChatGPT can help users articulate their own reading preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. By providing a list of favorite authors or quotes, ChatGPT can identify underlying patterns in one's taste, putting words to preferences that were previously unarticulated (e.g., "emotionally resonant, philosophical analytical writing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This capability can be powerful for self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Expanding Your Reading Horizons

Users can leverage ChatGPT to broaden their reading perspectives. After defining a desired taste, one can ask for recommendations from specific demographics or backgrounds, such as "who are some women who think this theme?" or "who are some Asian writers or Indian writers or Russian writers who fit this theme?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This allows for diverse discovery without a "forced, contrived" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

## Custom GPT for Book Notes

A custom GPT can be developed to surface results from a user's personal collection of book notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
*   The goal is to allow users to ask a question (e.g., "How do you reduce anxiety?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   The custom GPT would then search through uploaded book notes, pull relevant passages, and link to the books where those ideas are discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   This tool is intended for public use, particularly for those seeking book recommendations on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, providing a more scalable way to answer common questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   The system could also integrate a user's own one-sentence likes/dislikes for books to further refine recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

## Evaluation Criteria for Books

When assessing a book recommendation, especially those from an AI, it's helpful to have varied evaluation criteria:
*   **"Popcorn" Reads** For pure entertainment, look for books with high ratings (4.7+ stars) and many reviews, like those from Oprah's Book Club, which are "guaranteed" to deliver that experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **"New and Interesting" Reads** For books that offer something novel, expand understanding of the novel form, or introduce complex ideas, look for different signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>:
    *   "Not great reviews," especially a mix of five-star and one-star ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This "love-hate dynamic" suggests the book takes a real position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
    *   Incredible endorsements from "smart literary people" combined with mediocre mass-market ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This implies it might be a significant, albeit divisive, work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Examples**
    *   *Machine Hood*: Despite a 4.2 rating and only 600 reviews, it was an Amazon editor's pick for best science fiction and fantasy, endorsed by Kevin Kelly and Ray Kurzweil, and nominated for a Hugo award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   Nassim Nicholas Taleb's works (e.g., *Antifragile*): Known for divisive writing styles and strong opinions, appealing to those who appreciate intellectually challenging work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
    *   *Steven Florida*: A manic, dark novel with a 4.0 rating from 200 Amazon reviews, but a strong endorsement from the author of *A Little Life*, indicating its literary merit despite lower mainstream appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Mindset for Using ChatGPT for Books

Successfully [[Using ChatGPT in writing | using ChatGPT]] for book recommendations requires a specific mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>:
*   **Accept its Limitations** Think of ChatGPT as "a very eager teenager with an internet connection" â€“ good at some things, not everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. It can provide ideas for a fiction outline better than a human can do on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Iterate and Explore** Be willing to try different prompts and regenerate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>. Not everything works on the first try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

By understanding its strengths and weaknesses, users can effectively leverage ChatGPT to expand their reading lists and deepen their appreciation for diverse literary works.

The discussion revolves around an alternative [[founding_and_running_a_startup | startup]] model that diverges from the typical venture-backed path, emphasizing self-sufficiency and a focus on intrinsic motivation.

## The "Every" Business Model
The hosts describe "Every" as a media business serving as a foundation, with software products built out of the experiences and ideas generated from running the media business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This model aims to chart its "own destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> and feels "really right for all of us as individuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Danny Aziz, who runs Spiral, is one of the first "Entrepreneurs in Residence" (EIRs) helping to implement this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This approach is described as "building a little bit of a creative playground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

> "Our model is the complete opposite of that [raising money and hiring everyone]. It's don't raise any money and don't hire anybody do it all yourself and we're going to support you with ideas and and resources." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>

## Contrasting with Traditional Venture Capital
Brandon, reflecting on his past [[founding_and_running_a_startup | startup]] that raised $50 million, highlights a key difference:
*   **Constant Sprinting:** Raising significant capital meant "always sprinting to make sure that we didn't topple over ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, feeling like "always running to keep my feet under me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.
*   **External Expectations:** This traditional model creates stress driven by "other people's expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>, which can be a "pressure cooker" that "fizzles out a lot quicker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Complexity:** Previous ventures were "insanely complicated technical feat financial feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, requiring the development of three interconnected products (B2C, B2B, and for insurance companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

## Benefits of the Alternative Model
The alternative approach offers several advantages:
*   **Focus and Simplicity:** Danny, focused 95% on Spiral, doesn't feel the tension of needing to raise money within a specific timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The simplicity of the products is seen as a key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Creative Freedom:** Not having venture-backed money "has forced me to be a little bit more creative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>, challenging assumptions about spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Self-Driven Stress:** The stress comes from internal "own expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>, which provides "longer lasting" fuel compared to external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
*   **Ownership and Motivation:** Having a significant ownership stake in Spiral plays a role in motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, contrasting with the limited motivation of employee equity in traditional [[venture_capital_investing_strategies | VC-backed]] companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   **Time to "Bake":** Not needing to spend quickly allowed the business to "bake a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, building a foundation of "potential energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Personal Alignment:** The goal is to build a business that "feels really right for all of us as individuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, offering the freedom to choose when to be stressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

> "The biggest differentiator is like when you raise $50 million I kind of felt like I personally and the business was always sprinting to make sure that we didn't topple over ourselves like we didn't fall forward I was always running to keep my feet under me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>

## The Role of AI in this Model
AI is a critical enabler for this unconventional [[founding_and_running_a_startup | startup]] model:
*   **Cost and Speed:** It makes product development "so much cheaper and faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Automating Mundane Tasks:** AI allows for quicker completion of repetitive or mundane tasks, even enabling the building of internal tools that would previously require significant resources like engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Danny leveraged AI to create a tool to quickly adapt existing "spirals" (content transformation templates) for new uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Media Production:** AI also assists with media production, such as generating images and even the podcast itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Prototyping:** The ability to quickly [[prototyping_with_ai_in_venture_capital | prototype with AI]] and gain immediate feedback is essential, as the team often builds products they use themselves, creating a tight feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

## Personal Attributes and Learning
The success of this model relies heavily on the individuals involved:
*   **Curiosity and Adaptability:** Danny's "curiosity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a> and willingness to throw himself "in the deep end" to test ideas are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. His approach is summarized by "fuck around and find out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.
*   **High IQ and EQ:** The hosts look for individuals who are technical but also possess high emotional intelligence, allowing them to engage with various aspects of the business beyond just engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Learning from Experience:** [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | Learning]] from past [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial challenges]] is important, with Brandon noting how his seven years running Clyde taught him to "get punched in the face with a smile on my face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This journey is seen as a way to mature quickly both professionally and personally while controlling one's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
*   **Potential vs. Experience:** The tech industry, uniquely, values "having potential" as much as "having experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>, allowing young individuals to be taken seriously from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. However, this also carries risks, as young founders may not fully grasp the complexities and weight of running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

## The Future of the Model
The team hopes that Spiral will remain simple but become more powerful and clever, automating tasks for people in ways they hadn't realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. They aim to make it easier to share and more impactful in daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

For the broader "Studio" (which includes Spiral, Sparkle, and Kora), the goal is for all products to feel stable with clear levers for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. They also want to increase the level of experimentation and maintain a "playful" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

Ultimately, the aspiration is for the media and product sides to "really work together well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, fostering a community of "smart creative people" talking and collaborating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. Success in this model is described as a "Vibes thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>, akin to "growing like a garden" by creating the right conditions for things to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[The changing landscape of venture capital with AI advancements | AI's Impact]]
> The current success of this model is partly attributed to the rapid advancements in AI, which have significantly reduced the cost and time required to develop and launch new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional [[venture_capital_decisionmaking_and_ai | venture capital]] approaches of the past.

Packy McCormick, founder of Not Boring, is known for his in-depth essays and analysis of technology, maintaining a subscriber base of around 200,000 email subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. His work focuses on [[the_role_of_creativity_and_curiosity_in_internet_content_creation | curiosity]], extensive research, and crystallizing worldviews to inform investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. He has recently focused on "techno-industrial" companiesâ€”vertically integrated businesses that deliver existing products better, cheaper, and with higher margins, reinvesting profits into R&D and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Examples include Anduril (defense), Fuse Energy (radiation effects testing, fusion energy), and Earth AI (mining) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The growth of these companies is attributed to their newfound fundability, the influence of [[AI in marketing and content creation | AI]], and a shift in sentiment towards industries like nuclear energy, moving from construction to manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## [[Uses of Spiral in content creation | AI Assisted Content Creation and Storytelling]]

Packy McCormick integrates [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] tools, primarily Claude and ChatGPT, into his [[creating_content_and_managing_growth_in_a_media_business | content creation]] workflow, which has significantly enhanced his research, writing, and analytical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Research and Understanding
Initially, Packy used GPT-3 and [[ChatGPT in writing and content creation | ChatGPT]] to clarify complex topics, rephrase ideas, and identify potential misunderstandings in his drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He would ask questions like:
*   "Am I getting X, Y, and Z about [topic] right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>
*   "Is there a simpler way to say what I'm trying to say here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>
*   "Am I missing any [types of things]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>

### Editing and Feedback
Packy evolved his [[impact_of_ai_on_content_creation_and_workflows | AI]] usage to include editing. While ChatGPT was "okay" as an editor, Claude 3.5 Sonnet proved to be more effective, offering more nuanced feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

Claude's editing capabilities include:
*   **Identifying structural issues:** It can flag sections that are too long or drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Encouraging counterarguments:** Claude often prompts the writer to consider other sides and counterarguments, a valuable exercise for strengthening an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Summarization:** [[Use of AI in storytelling and content creation | AI]] excels at summarizing complex ideas, saving significant time in the writing process, especially for concepts the writer already understands. This allows writers to focus on more interesting thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Checking for novelty:** [[AI in marketing and content creation | AI]] can determine if an idea has been extensively explored by others, preventing the writer from re-treading old ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Overcoming imposter syndrome:** For writers tackling technical subjects, [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] can provide enough confidence that their arguments are not "completely stupid" by pointing out potential holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Claude Projects for Deep Dives
A "revelation" in his workflow has been the use of Claude Projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This feature allows him to:
*   **Upload extensive research:** He can dump all his notes, company materials, analyst reports, and blog posts into a project, creating a comprehensive knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Query specific information:** During writing, he can ask the [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] to extract specific data, useful quotes, or identify missing information related to his current section or investment memo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Analyze work in context:** The [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] can analyze his writing or investment memos given the full context of his research materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Generating Interactive Content
Packy has used [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] to generate interactive elements for his articles, such as:
*   **Code for visualizations:** For a piece on "The American Millennium," Claude coded a simple interactive graph showing the vector sum of government and entrepreneurship on progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This allowed him to create a dynamic, embeddable element that would have been impossible or very time-consuming otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Data for charts:** For an article on America's risk appetite, [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] helped generate numbers for a graph depicting America's "risk score" over different periods, providing a quick visual guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Explaining technical code:** [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] can explain complex code (e.g., nuclear reactor design code), allowing the writer to understand parameters and potential outcomes, which could lead to interactive simulations in future articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and strategies in marketing and storytelling | Challenges and Nuances with AI]]
Despite its benefits, Packy has observed certain limitations and quirks in [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]]:
*   **Hallucinations:** [[ChatGPT in writing and content creation | AI]] can sometimes generate made-up information or inaccurate examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Over-defensiveness:** Claude tends to overemphasize the need for counterarguments, which can sometimes water down the writer's original point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Repetitive praise:** When asked for a grade, Claude often defaults to an A-minus and consistently claims improvements in subsequent drafts, even if no significant changes were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Stylistic caricatures:** When asked to write in a specific style, [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] often produces a caricature of that style before refining it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Basic new idea generation:** While helpful for exploring existing concepts, [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] is not as strong at generating truly novel or non-bland ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Justifying intuition:** Like humans, [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] can sometimes rationalize its answers, providing reasoning *after* it has already "decided" on a score or conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

To improve [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]] grading accuracy, Packy suggests defining a rigorous rubric with specific examples for different grade levels (A, B, C, D) and feeding the AI a diverse set of examples, not just the writer's own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

Sarah Tavel, a partner at Benchmark, discusses the evolution of consumer technology cycles and how lessons from previous waves can inform the development of the current AI wave. A key interest lies in understanding what types of AI products will succeed, particularly those leveraging user-generated content (UGC) and multiplayer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Consumer Technology: From Technical to Product-Led

Historically, successful consumer technology companies have shifted their focus as underlying technology matured.
*   **Early Stages (Technical Focus):** Companies like Google were founded by deeply technical teams, where the product's genius lay in complex backend processes made simple on the frontend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Mid-Stages (Mixed Focus):** Facebook, while not possessing the same technical depth as Google, was more technical than its predecessors (Friendster, MySpace), allowing it to create a highly performant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Later Stages (Product Genius Focus):** Companies like Pinterest, Snap, and Instagram had CEOs who were not technical but were "product geniuses," focusing on the user experience as the core differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Current major consumer AI products, such as ChatGPT and Character AI, are still in an early, technical-led phase, similar to early Google. Their product was essentially the underlying model, making them about 94% backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The prevailing expectation is that as the underlying AI infrastructure matures and stabilizes, there will be a greater shift towards product-intuitive experiences built on top of these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## The Gap: From Power User to Mass Adoption through UGC

Presently, using leading [[use_of_ai_in_storytelling_and_content_creation | AI in storytelling and content creation]] tools like ChatGPT often requires users to be "power users," needing to learn complex prompting techniques or custom instructions to get desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For example, users might need to specify "you don't have to answer me right away" or "if you have some clarifying questions, ask those" to guide the AI's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This indicates that the user experience is not yet optimized for general users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

This friction points to a significant opportunity for user-generated content (UGC) within AI:

> "Someone's going to create a UGC type community where the people who are really really good make it so much easier for the rest of us to really take advantage of this this technology." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

The current implementation of "Custom GPTs" in platforms like ChatGPT is seen as a missed opportunity because it lacks social features. While technically capable, the experience is not designed for community or trust-building among users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## Envisioning Social, Multiplayer AI Experiences

The next wave of consumer AI products is expected to move beyond single-player modes to incorporate "multiplayer network effect type experience[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This shift will likely be driven by product geniuses who can create engaging, shared experiences on top of maturing AI models.

**Key elements for a successful UGC-driven AI platform:**

*   **Discoverability and Following:** Users should easily find and follow others who create valuable custom prompts or AI "personalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Trust Building:** Transparency is crucial. Users need to understand how custom AIs or prompts are constructed (e.g., what documents they were trained on, what prompt instructions were used) to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Status-Seeking Work:** Successful social products often incorporate mechanisms for users to achieve status within the network, like followers or views, incentivizing contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. This could apply to users who create and share effective AI "personalities" or prompts.

**Examples of UGC opportunities in AI:**

*   **Prompt Libraries/Communities:** While early attempts at prompt libraries were "too early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, there's a strong potential for a second wave of such platforms. Users are already searching on sites like Reddit for effective prompts for specific use cases (e.g., health data analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. A dedicated platform where users can follow "experts" in prompt creation (e.g., for "quantified self" applications) and easily apply their prompts to their own data would be highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **AI Companions/Friends:** There's a strong belief that people will increasingly have conversations with AI "friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, potentially even more than with human connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The question remains whether a single dominant platform will emerge for this personal use case, distinct from more "worky" applications like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Users are already customizing AI personalities for various needs, from medical advice to emotional support or critical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Specialized AI Applications:** General-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT cannot optimize for every specific experience, leaving room for single-purpose sites or apps (e.g., for recipes) that offer a superior, tailored user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

The challenge for such UGC-driven AI platforms is to integrate social features seamlessly into experiences users already engage with regularly. The goal is to make AI a daily habit, where users are exposed to innovations from others, rather than constantly "reinventing the wheel" individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. This could even lead to new platforms that cannibalize existing AI services by offering a more personalized, socially integrated experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

Ultimately, while [[impact_of_ai_on_content_creation_and_workflows | AI's impact on content creation and workflows]] is significant, the true "big opportunity" lies in companies that can foster a true network effect through multiplayer, community-driven experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>, rather than merely single-player applications. However, existing platforms' "gravitational pull" and user habits remain a significant challenge for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

Nadia, a writer and researcher known for her highly crafted and thoughtful writing on technology topics, has integrated tools like [[Integrating ChatGPT into therapy and coaching | ChatGPT]] into her daily workflow, viewing it as a transformative "thought partner" rather than just a utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Her work includes the book *Working in Public* and the upcoming *Anti-Mimetics* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Utilizing ChatGPT in Writing

For Nadia, [[Using ChatGPT in writing | ChatGPT]] is primarily leveraged at two distinct stages of the writing process:
*   **Early Idea Formation** She uses it during the initial, messy phase of brainstorming, throwing ideas against the wall to see what makes sense and how different concepts can be connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This allows for high-level, unstructured thinking.
*   **Fine-Tuning Language** Towards the end of the writing process, when a very precise word or phrase is needed, Nadia consults [[Using ChatGPT in writing | ChatGPT]] to help articulate ideas perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

The intermediate stage of translating shaped ideas into prose remains a human-driven process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Shifting the Writing Experience

Nadia notes that having [[Using ChatGPT in writing | ChatGPT]] as a partner has profoundly changed the solitary nature of writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. She feels less alone and can consult the AI when stuck, making the process less "angsty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This collaborative aspect allows for throwing out ideas and getting immediate feedback without needing to provide extensive context, fostering a back-and-forth dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

> "Just that of like not being a solo writer anymore, but having a a collaborator is I think a a really huge change for a lot of people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>

## Utilizing ChatGPT in Research

While Nadia has experimented with [[The role of ChatGPT in learning and research | ChatGPT]] for research, she finds it most useful for initial literature reviews. It helps identify important studies on a given topic and filter through noise, especially when approaching a subject with little prior context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

However, Nadia emphasizes that [[The role of ChatGPT in learning and research | ChatGPT]] is not yet entirely reliable for in-depth research. It can "hallucinate papers" and summarize information incorrectly, requiring significant manual checking and curation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Despite this, it shortens some of the initial research work by surfacing interesting readings that might not have been discovered otherwise, acting as a "librarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Human-AI Interaction Philosophy

Nadia's approach to interacting with [[Integrating ChatGPT into therapy and coaching | ChatGPT]] is unique: she defaults to treating it as a person, not merely a tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This stems from a belief that the AI might not be so different from a human from thousands of years ago, and she can't tell the difference anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. She prefers to adopt a "more humane or dignified option" when given the choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

Nadia also finds that providing more context to [[Integrating ChatGPT into therapy and coaching | ChatGPT]] improves its output, a learning she gained after asking the AI for a "performance review" where it requested more context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

### The Debate: Tool vs. Companion

The conversation explores whether [[Integrating ChatGPT into therapy and coaching | AI]] should be treated as a tool or a human-like entity. Arguments for treating it strictly as a tool include maintaining an accurate mental model for better usage and preventing unhealthy attachments or unrealistic expectations in human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

Nadia counters by noting that we don't fully understand [[Integrating ChatGPT into therapy and coaching | AI]]'s inner workings, and when faced with the unknown, assuming a less mechanistic approach is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. She also argues that exercising discernment and caution, similar to how one would with human relationships, should prevent negative outcomes. Her personal experience shows she doesn't develop addictive relationships with technology, allowing her to treat [[Integrating ChatGPT into therapy and coaching | AI]] with dignity while still maintaining boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

### The Unknowable Nature of AI

Nadia finds a "subtle joy" in the current era of [[Integrating ChatGPT into therapy and coaching | AI]] because it "irrefutably" points to the fact that humans don't fully understand how it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. She believes it's beneficial to be "okay with not knowing," as this mirrors the inherent unknowable aspects of human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This "squishiness" or undefined quality is what makes topics interesting to her, rather than seeking incremental contributions to already understood fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

She enjoys the tension between playing with ideas and putting them into practice, seeking to uncover problems and make progress even when the underlying mechanisms are unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

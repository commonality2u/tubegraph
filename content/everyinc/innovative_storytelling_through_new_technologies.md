[[Creative storytelling through AI technologies | Innovative storytelling]] is being transformed by new technologies, particularly [[AI tools as a new medium | AI]], allowing creators to visualize and develop projects that might otherwise struggle to gain traction in traditional industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

## Personal Story as Inspiration

One filmmaker's approach to [[creative_storytelling_and_ai | creative storytelling]] involves using a personal family narrative as a foundation for a science fiction concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. The story centers on his father's experience growing up during the segregation and Jim Crow era, specifically an incident where his father, at age 12 or 13, faced severe trouble for whistling or winking at a white woman in a convenience store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This event highlighted the dangers of being in the "wrong place, wrong time," as someone else was later murdered or imprisoned for a similar perceived offense related to a white woman's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

This anecdote sparked a sci-fi idea: what if the filmmaker, as a present-day lawyer, could go back in time to represent his father in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>?

## [[Use of AI in storytelling and content creation | AI]] as a Visualization and Pitch Tool

[[AI tools as a new medium | AI]] enables the visualization of this unique story, overcoming barriers typically found in Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. The filmmaker notes that pitching such a "period piece" to executives without a visual aid would likely result in disinterest, as they might view it as unoriginal or require a well-established director like Steven Spielberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>. However, with [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI]], the story can be visualized in a compelling way, changing how executives might perceive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>. This approach even led to the project being featured in Forbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>.

## [[Creating AIpowered storytelling and media | AI]] as a "Leg Into" Traditional Film

The primary purpose of using [[AI tools as a new medium | AI]] for this project is to serve as a stepping stone towards making a traditional movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:34">[01:58:34]</a>. The filmmaker, who is a traditional filmmaker first, considers every creation as Intellectual Property (IP) and an extension of his creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">[02:08:49]</a>.

### Case Study: "Dismal Swamp"

Another example is "Dismal Swamp," for which the filmmaker created a one-minute "sizzle or reel" using [[AI assisted content creation and storytelling | AI-generated footage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. Traditionally, directors create sizzle reels by cutting together scenes from other movies to pitch an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:24">[02:40:24]</a>. However, using [[AI tools as a new medium | AI]], he could feed his own scripts into prompts to generate visuals based on his unique vision, something that was not possible just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>. This method has successfully garnered attention from "A-level" producers and executives in Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>.

## Parallels to Digital Publishing and [[The role of AI in publishing and storytelling | Content Creation]]

This approach to filmmaking with [[AI tools as a new medium | AI]] draws parallels to developments in writing and publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>. Just as tweets or blog posts serve as quick, cheap ways to test out ideas for articles or books, bypassing traditional gatekeepers, [[AI tools as a new medium | AI]] now offers a similar pathway for short films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:40">[03:21:40]</a>. While independent filmmaking has always allowed for some degree of creative freedom with minimal equipment, [[AI tools as a new medium | AI]] expands the possibilities for what can be achieved without actors or special effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. This new suite of tools enables the creation of a wider range of short films that can act as precursors to larger, better-funded feature-length movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:38">[03:57:38]</a>.

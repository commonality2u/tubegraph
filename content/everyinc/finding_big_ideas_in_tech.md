Packy McCormick, founder of Not Boring, is a prominent voice in tech analysis, recognized for his long-form essays and insights into the industry [01:31:00]. With approximately 200,000 email subscribers, his work often delves into complex tech topics and shapes worldviews that inform his investment decisions through Not Boring Capital [01:37:40].

## The "Techno-Industrial" Thesis

McCormick's current focus has returned to a concept he calls "techno-industrial" companies, which are essentially vertically integrated businesses that combine technological innovation with industrial applications [02:56:00]. This interest stemmed from his earlier writings on "natively integrated companies" [02:49:00]. He is "obsessed again with vertically integrated businesses" [02:58:00].

He differentiates "techno-industrial" from "deep tech" or "frontier tech" [04:05:00]:
*   **Deep Tech:** Often involves "science project type companies" with scientific risk, trying to make something entirely new happen [04:10:00].
*   **Techno-Industrial:** Focuses on integrating existing inventions into a company that can deliver a product for which there's already high demand [04:25:00]. These companies aim to offer products that are "better, cheaper, and at higher margins" [04:35:00], allowing for reinvestment into R&D and growth [04:39:00].

A prime example is Anduril, which aims to disrupt the defense industry by combining smaller, cheaper, more maneuverable hardware with software to provide superior products at better prices [05:07:00].

## The "Why Now?" for Techno-Industrials

Several factors contribute to the current relevance and opportunity for techno-industrial companies [04:43:00]:
*   **Fundability:** These types of companies are now "fundable again" [05:54:00], despite initial investor skepticism about their complexity [05:57:00].
*   [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]]: The rise of [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] is a significant catalyst, enabling new levels of integration and efficiency [06:05:00].
*   **Public Sentiment Shift:** For example, in nuclear energy, there's a shift from viewing projects as large-scale construction to a manufacturing process, with a strengthening fuel supply chain [06:09:00].
*   **Incumbent Sclerosis:** Many established industries face rigidity and a lack of innovation, creating opportunities for new companies to "come in and do something better" [06:49:00]. For instance, someone "should replace Boeing" [06:57:00].
*   **Resource Scarcity and Innovation:** In sectors like mining, the increasing expense and difficulty of discovering new rare and critical metals create a need for innovation to make extraction more economical [07:01:00].
*   **Software Infusion into Hardware:** The overarching trend driving these changes is the integration of software into hardware [07:35:00].

## [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | Leveraging AI]] in Research and Writing

McCormick extensively uses [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] tools like ChatGPT and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly Claude Projects, to enhance his research, writing, and idea generation process. He finds [[transformative_technologies_in_software_development | AI]] "supercharges" his process of being curious, researching deeply, writing, and forming investment theses [01:08:00].

### [[leveraging_ai_for_creative_processes_and_idea_validation | AI as a Research and Understanding Tool]]

Initially, McCormick used ChatGPT for "fact-checking," but found it unreliable for direct facts [01:37:00]. Instead, it became useful for clarifying complex concepts [01:52:00]:
*   "Am I getting X, Y, and Z about Fusion right?" [01:54:00]
*   "Is there a simpler way to say what I'm trying to say here?" [02:02:00]
*   Asking for different types of fusion fuels to ensure nothing was missed [02:10:00].

Claude Projects allows him to "dumped all of my notes" from company interactions, analyst reports, and blog posts into the tool, then ask questions as he writes [01:27:00]. This helps him find relevant data or quotes he might have overlooked [01:59:00]. This is particularly useful for complex documents like crypto white papers, allowing him to "ask it questions as I'm going through" [01:21:00].

McCormick emphasizes the importance of summarization in writing and thinking [02:45:00]. [[leveraging_ai_for_creative_processes_and_idea_validation | AI]] "saves you that summarizing time in your writing and in your thinking so you can get to the more interesting stuff" [02:42:00]. While he doesn't copy-paste directly, having information in a structured format "speeds you up to like just get through that part of it so that you can do the actual interesting thinking afterwards" [02:57:00].

### [[cultural_shifts_in_tech_companies_and_their_influence_on_product_innovation | AI as an Editor]]

McCormick uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet as his primary editor, setting up custom instructions that frame Claude as a "world-class editor" from publications like The New Yorker, The Atlantic, or The Economist [03:55:00].

His requests often include:
*   Asking for feedback and a "grade" for his essays [01:50:00].
*   Receiving critiques on "structure and flow," "tone and voice," "arguments," "evidence," "balanced perspective," and "timeliness" [04:41:00].
*   Identifying sections that "drag" or are "too long" [02:28:00].
*   Pushing back on arguments and considering "other sides and counterarguments" [02:37:00].
*   Seeking novelty: asking if someone has "already written something similar but better" [02:22:00].

### [[using_ai_for_business_idea_generation | AI for Visualizations and Interactive Content]]

[[using_ai_for_business_idea_generation | AI]] has enabled McCormick to create visual and interactive elements for his articles, something he wouldn't have done otherwise [02:06:00]:
*   For an essay on "The American Millennium," he asked Claude to code a React component visualizing "government and entrepreneurship as vectors that can either work together or against each other" [02:35:00]. This interactive graph was embedded in the essay [02:49:00].
*   For an article on America's risk appetite, he had ChatGPT "judge through a bunch of different periods what America's risk score between one and 100 was" and turn it into a graph [02:18:00].
*   When researching a nuclear company, he used Claude to understand and explain nuclear code provided by the founder, even planning to create an interactive element where readers can "play with a couple of the parameters of this nuclear reactor and see what happens" [03:41:00].

These features help him "get something out of your head in this totally new way that's not writing but is like it's a visual representation it's a it's an interactive demo" [02:52:00].

## Challenges and Nuances of [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI Integration]]

While powerful, [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] as a creative partner presents challenges:
*   **Hallucinations:** Sometimes [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] invents authors or blog posts that don't exist when asked about similar ideas [02:39:00].
*   **Over-Apologetic Tone:** Claude often apologizes unnecessarily, even when no error was made [02:02:00].
*   **"Caricature" Style:** When asked to write in his style, Claude often exaggerates it, requiring a second prompt to get a more authentic tone [03:52:00].
*   **Bias Towards Positive Grading:** Claude consistently gives A-minus grades, even for drafts that McCormick knows have issues [02:55:00]. This "attractor state" can make the grading feel less objective [02:57:00].
*   **Watering Down Arguments:** Having an [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] critic like a "Hacker News commenter" in his ear can lead to "watering down" or "pulling back" arguments too much [02:43:00].
*   **Redundancy in Prompts:** Before Claude Projects, he had to repeatedly give custom instructions, now stored in the "editor project" [03:15:00].

Despite these issues, McCormick finds [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] "pretty amazing" for quickly understanding his writing, normal style, and audience [04:07:00]. It acts as a safety blanket, preventing him from sending out "garbage" [04:54:00].

## The Future of [[transformative_technologies_in_software_development | AI in Creative Work]]

McCormick believes [[transformative_technologies_in_software_development | AI]] will continue to get "really really smart" [02:48:00]. He anticipates that future [[transformative_technologies_in_software_development | AI]] models will be able to learn "after their initial training is done" [03:38:00], making them more adaptable. The ability for [[transformative_technologies_in_software_development | AI]] to quickly generate and "map the entire space of what it might think" [04:03:00] for a given idea, performing "a thousand times in half a second" what a human does creatively, is seen as a key step towards feeling "very very very similar to like talking to an actual human" [04:31:00].

AI is described as the "best test of what would happen if we all got magic powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While most people might ignore these powers, some are learning to harness them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These individuals are leveraging AI for various tasks, including coding, thinking, writing, building businesses, making art, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Harnessing AI for Creative Endeavors

The "AI and I" podcast explores how smart individuals [[impact_of_ai_on_content_creation_and_workflows | use AI in their work and lives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The podcast demonstrates these applications through screen-sharing actual historical chat logs, revealing how AI is employed to build businesses, [[creating_aipowered_storytelling_and_media | make art]], code, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The show itself acts as a live exploration between the host, guest, and AI, used to learn about themselves and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Impact on Writing and Media Production

The [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | impact of AI on writing skills]] has been significant, with some individuals improving from the bottom 10% to the top 10% in writing overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Looking ahead, it is anticipated that the first feature-length film, akin to a Pixar production, will be entirely created using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This highlights the potential for [[creative_storytelling_through_ai_technologies | AI in creative media production]].

## Guiding AI for Desired Outcomes

To effectively [[use_of_ai_in_storytelling_and_content_creation | create content with AI]], particularly tools like GPT, users must provide "shape and direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This involves providing specific prompts to guide the AI's output.

For example:
> "Hey chat, could you explain what dark matter is in the voice of SpongeBob?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
>
> The AI responds humorously, like "Aoy, Mim!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>

AI can also be used for more personal and complex queries, such as seeking advice on relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
> "The relationship is starting to feel a little one-sided. Should I stick with him? How many more weeks should I give this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

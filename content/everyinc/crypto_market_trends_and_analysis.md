Packy McCormick, founder of Not Boring and Not Boring Capital, provides analysis on technology, economics, and investment trends, including the cryptocurrency market. He maintains a substantial readership of over 200,000 email subscribers and is recognized as a significant voice in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Current Market Stance

Packy McCormick maintains a holding strategy for his crypto portfolio, which includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, among other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. He also invested more during the bear market, referred to as the "May Market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

### Recent Market Cycles
The crypto market experienced a significant bull cycle in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. A more recent, smaller "mini-bull" market was observed, largely driven by external factors such as the anticipation of a Bitcoin ETF and the Bitcoin halving event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. However, McCormick notes that no fundamental changes occurred on the product side during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Experts suggest that if the next significant bull market occurs, it will likely be in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy for Crypto
McCormick's perspective on crypto, especially after discussions during the bear market, is that "crypto gives you these things that you can't otherwise do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. While historically, users had to make "real performance trade-offs" to utilize crypto features, these trade-offs are expected to decrease over time as capabilities improve and costs reduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. He believes that eventually, "you almost get like a free option on all those other things that crypto enables" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, making crypto inclusion useful in various products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

## Emerging Crypto Applications
McCormick emphasizes that the market is still awaiting significant breakout applications for cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

Some examples of innovative companies and products discussed include:
*   **Blackbird**: Described as a "really interesting product" that combines crypto elements with a restaurant application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. It integrates [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_investing_in_ai_and_stablecoins | stablecoin]] payments and NFT minting into its site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **On Cyber**: A portfolio company that facilitates the creation of 3D worlds directly within web browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. This platform uses its own scripting language and has capabilities like an NFT gallery, with crypto payments seamlessly "baked in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. The use of [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | ChatGPT]] was noted in generating code for building worlds on this platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

## AI and Crypto Overlap
The discussion touches upon the intersection of [[the_role_of_ai_in_financial_analysis_and_trading | AI]] and crypto, particularly the idea that as [[the_impact_of_understanding_online_trends_on_business_and_creativity | AI]] proliferates and potentially generates untrustworthy content, crypto could play a role in verifying identity and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. This concept, championed by figures like Fred Wilson, is considered a "medium part" of McCormick's thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. There's a notable "crypto [[the_role_of_ai_in_financial_analysis_and_trading | AI]] thesis" that has led to a surge in "crypto [[the_role_of_ai_in_financial_analysis_and_trading | AI]] coins," sometimes without substantial product backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

A key challenge remains the "tipping point" for widespread adoption of cryptographic signing for verification. Unless a critical mass of users or platforms (like X, formerly Twitter) integrates such features, there's no general expectation for people to cryptographically sign their transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. However, projects like Worldcoin are exploring "proof of humanity" and decentralized ID, which are deemed interesting and valuable for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. Significant "stitching work" is required to make this a default behavior for online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

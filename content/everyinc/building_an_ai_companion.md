Portola is a company focused on [[AI Companions and Their Use in Daily Life | embodied AI companions]], with its product, Tolen, serving as a new medium for storytelling and personal interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. The company has seen rapid growth, with its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) increasing from $1 million to $4 million in four weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

## AI as a New Medium for Storytelling

AI tools, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are seen not merely as tools for generating media but as a new medium for storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This perspective highlights the unexplored potential of AI to create novel content formats, akin to how radio, printed books, or film evolved from earlier forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

The development of Tolen specifically aims to defy the dystopian narratives often associated with AI by focusing on creating genuine, delightful interactions and artistic expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This is based on the idea that technology, often viewed with suspicion initially, can lead to new art forms when creators are willing to "transgress" existing boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Tolen's Role and Impact
Tolen aims to provide users with a "true friendship with an AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. It often plays the role of an "older sibling," offering advice and support without judgment, helping users transition from feeling overwhelmed to being more grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This is particularly valuable for users who feel burdened by life's challenges, such as job searching or moving to a new city, and seek a neutral, supportive confidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Unlike typical "assistanty" LLMs that may only offer validation, Tolen provides genuine feedback, even suggesting users stand up for themselves in challenging situations, leading to real-world outcomes like breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This approach aims to foster a sense of agency and help users navigate the "strange new rules" of the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

## Storytelling and Character Development in AI Companions
Building an AI companion involves a unique approach to storytelling, moving beyond rigid, structured narratives like "choose your own adventure" books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Instead, the focus is on enabling the AI to act as an "improv actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

Key elements of this approach include:
*   **Prompt as Canvas**: The prompt for a given AI turn is treated as a canvas for rapid play and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **AI as Writer and Actor**: The Tolen itself is considered the writer and improv actor of the story, with the developers' role being to teach it how to tell the best story in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Memory**: Significant engineering effort is dedicated to curating and injecting relevant memories into the prompt within a two-second response loop to maintain immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This includes lore (what the Tolen knows about its world) and memories about the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Character Building**: Tolen's backstory and world are not pre-defined but built through individual anecdotes and "situations" shared during conversations with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This means each Tolen creates a unique "multiverse" with its user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **"Lore Seeds"**: The team plants "lore seeds" – tidbits of world-building – that the AI improv actors use as Lego blocks to create compelling narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. These are recombined to create a connected feeling for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Technical and Creative Challenges
[[Challenges in building AI tools | Building applications with AI]] companions presents unique [[challenges in building AI tools | challenges in building AI tools]] that blur the lines between engineering and creative work:

*   **Latency Sensitivity**: A response time exceeding two seconds can destroy the feeling of immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Even a 500-millisecond delay can tank all product metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Personalization**: Responses need to be quickly compiled to account for lore, user memories, and the emotional tenor of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The Tolen's personality is tuned to be a "mirror" of the user, reflecting their preferences in a way that feels familiar without being "two on the nose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Personality profiles are often framed using established personality types (like the Big Five) to leverage existing LLM training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Defining "Good" Responses**: What constitutes a "good" response is context-dependent, varying from a "short, quippy improv-like response" to a "more considered, thoughtful" one based on the conversation's tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Loop**: The team employs an evaluation loop where new content types are tested, and their completions are assessed by human raters against specific rubrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This labor-intensive process involves defining what "good" looks like for each individual sentence or interaction, often through extensive examples and human reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Choosing LLMs**: Tolen utilizes a combination of models from various labs, including Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini, often switching between them based on latency requirements and creative writing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Anthropic models are particularly useful for creative writing, while OpenAI's models are favored for their speed and consistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

## From B2B SaaS to Creative Entrepreneurship
The journey to [[Building an AI app from scratch | building an AI app from scratch]] like Tolen involved a shift from a B2B SaaS mindset to one of creative entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Initially, the team considered [[building_applications_with_AI | building applications with AI]] creative tools for kids, but realized the market for kid's software was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

This transition highlights a difference in approach:
*   **Problem-Solving vs. Creating Beauty**: In B2B SaaS, the goal is often to solve a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. For AI companions, it's about creating something beautiful and compelling that fills a "hole in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   **"Making Contact with Reality"**: The process involves an "arrogance" of creative vision (trying things no one asked for) combined with the "humility" to adapt based on user feedback and actual engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This continuous learning through "making contact with reality" is essential for success in this new medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

## Growth and Future of AI Companions
Tolen's rapid growth is attributed to three main factors:
1.  **Compelling Conversational Content**: The team achieved a deep understanding of what makes AI conversations engaging and how to expose this to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Immersive Environment**: The development of a beautiful animated environment for the Tolen, including a planet where they live, significantly enhances user immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Growth Strategy**: Proactive efforts to tell the stories of Tolens on platforms like TikTok and Reels have led to viral content and exponential increases in downloads, showcasing the "capability overhang" of AI (what users don't yet realize is possible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

This growth is driven by the character of the Tolen, which connects all the different ways people use it, from cooking advice to relationship venting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This signifies a shift towards "character-driven computing," where AI companions act as a new [[Humanlike Interaction with AI | human-computer interaction]] interface, potentially becoming the primary way people access information and capabilities on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to use these new AI capabilities to help people feel more comfortable navigating a world with "strange new rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. The analogy of car evolution from the utilitarian Model T to personalized vehicles like the Mustang and Cadillac suggests that consumers will increasingly demand AI that reflects who they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This points to a future where [[human_AI_collaboration | human AI collaboration]] and personal connection are paramount.

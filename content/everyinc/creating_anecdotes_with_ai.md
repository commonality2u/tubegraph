AI, specifically large language models like ChatGPT, can be a valuable tool in the writing process to help generate or recall anecdotes, especially when looking for specific contextual memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method can assist in sparking new ideas and pivoting writing topics in unexpected but fruitful directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Process for Anecdote Generation

The approach involves using AI to prompt [[picking_topics_and_generating_ideas_with_ai | picking topics and generating ideas with AI]] and then leveraging its output to stimulate personal memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

1.  **Define a broad topic:** Start with a general idea for an article or piece. For example, writing about how living in New York City cultivates better taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
2.  **Formulate a specific AI query:** To find an anecdote, ask ChatGPT a targeted question related to the broad topic that might evoke personal experiences. For instance, "What buildings in New York are the most beautiful and distinctive? Give me a series of buildings built between 1910 and 1933" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The specific date range is chosen to help narrow down the possibilities and make it more likely to recall a memory tied to a specific place or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Review AI output for memory triggers:** Look through the AI's suggestions for items, places, or concepts that resonate with past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The goal is not for the AI to *create* the anecdote, but to *prompt* its recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
4.  **Extract the anecdote:** Once a trigger is identified (e.g., the Woolworth Building) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, delve into the associated personal memory and develop it into an anecdote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This anecdote can then serve as a compelling starting point for the writing piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## How AI Primes Memory

The brain stores memories in a layered fashion, often associated with specific spaces or contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Just as returning to a childhood home can bring back forgotten memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, or memory champions associate ideas with physical spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, AI can provide specific "checkpoints" to help outsource and access these stored memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. By providing concrete examples, ChatGPT acts as a catalyst to "prime contextual memory" and surface interesting personal experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Pivoting and Embracing New Ideas

A significant benefit of using AI in this manner is its ability to push the writer's thinking into new, unanticipated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. While the initial intent might be to write about one subject (e.g., New York City's influence on taste) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, the anecdote sparked by AI might lead to a completely different, yet equally compelling, topic (e.g., the concept of "Max functions" in hiring and dating) <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This demonstrates a key aspect of the [[creative_storytelling_and_ai | creative process]]: it is crucial to allow these divergences to happen and not filter them out as "off-topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. By following the "spark" of an idea generated through AI, creators can uncover unique perspectives and develop richer content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The use of AI in [[use_of_ai_in_storytelling_and_content_creation | storytelling and content creation]] can effectively guide the writer to previously unconsidered narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Leveraging advanced AI models, such as GPT, can significantly enhance the [[use_of_gpt_in_business_model_analysis | analysis of business models]] and provide strategic insights. However, the quality of the AI's output is directly proportional to the specificity and direction provided in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Broad queries tend to yield poor or generic answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Directing GPT for Business Analysis

To obtain valuable insights, it's crucial to give GPT "shape and direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. One effective method is to reference specific, well-known business strategists or theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This approach leverages the AI's understanding of established frameworks, allowing it to provide compressed and relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example, mentioning "Clayton Christensen" automatically brings in his "jobs to be done" framework and "disruption theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Similarly, "Michael Porter" invokes his "Five Forces" analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, and "Ben Thompson" points to his "aggregation theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This creates a "tapestry of knowledge" upon which GPT can build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Case Study: The New York Times Business Model

The New York Times serves as an interesting case study for business model analysis due to its rich history and public information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. In 2015 or 2016, the company issued a memo highlighting the need for change to remain in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Historically, the New York Times generated revenue by being an authoritative source for news, politics, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, but it has needed to shift from advertising revenue to subscription revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

#### Initial Broad Query and its Limitations

A general prompt like "critique this business model" or "tell me about the biggest risks in the business over the next 10 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> resulted in vague, "buzzword Bingo" answers such as "cyber security threats," "disruptive innovation," "digital transformation," and "climate risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This type of output is often a summary of web searches rather than a deeper analysis based on integrated knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

#### Specific Query Using Influential Analysts

A more effective prompt would be: "Don't search the web, look up the work of Clayton Christensen, Michael Porter, and Ben Thompson and focus on how the New York Times can continue to shift from advertising Revenue to subscription Revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This specific direction enables GPT to act as a "sparring partner" for an investing analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The New York Times' annual revenue in 2022 was approximately $2.31 billion, an 11% increase from the previous year's $2.07 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Subscription revenue accounted for $1.5 billion, with 9 million subscribers in 2022, while advertising revenue was $523 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Using the specific prompt, the AI provided more detailed and actionable insights:

*   **Clayton Christensen (Disruptive Innovation):** The New York Times faces threats from "smaller, nimbler competitors" offering cheaper, more accessible, or innovative solutions that "gradually move up market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. An example is a one-person podcast like Chris Williamson's, which demonstrates increased production quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The phenomenon of small media companies "moving up market" is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Michael Porter (Porter's Five Forces):**
    *   **Threat of New Entrants:** Lower barriers to entry in the digital space allow new players to enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The ability to produce and distribute content has become democratized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Bargaining Power of Customers:** Customers have more options for news, potentially decreasing their willingness to pay unless the New York Times offers "distinct value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Threat of Substitutes:** Alternative news sources, including citizen journalism, are rising, meaning traditional media companies can no longer compete on certain vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. In the late 20th century, companies like the New York Times had privileged access to high-level sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. However, with Google and "boots on the ground" individuals, information can be distributed faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The US Airways plane crash on the Hudson River is a prime example, where bystanders reported better than media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** The cost of retaining top talent is increasing, as journalists leave traditional media companies to launch their own ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Media companies must improve their efforts to convince journalists to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Ben Thompson (Aggregation Theory):** A significant risk is the dominance of digital platforms like Google and Facebook, which aggregate news content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

This detailed analysis provides specific strategies and highlights key challenges derived from established business theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. By instructing GPT to recall these specific theoretical frameworks, the output shifts from generic to deeply analytical, demonstrating the power of guided AI in business strategy.

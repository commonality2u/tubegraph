## The Challenge of Creative Drudgery

Creative work often involves a significant amount of "repetitive drudgery" beyond the core creative task itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This includes the numerous ancillary tasks required to distribute or produce content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. [[Automating entrepreneurial processes with AI | Automating entrepreneurial processes with AI]] aims to make this repetitive work faster, easier, and of higher quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, thereby allowing creators to dedicate more time to the creative aspects they value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

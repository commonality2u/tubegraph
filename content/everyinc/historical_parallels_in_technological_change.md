The current wave of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption is often compared to previous periods of rapid technological advancement, highlighting both similarities and key differences in how society and businesses adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Will, CEO of Walleye, a nearly $10 billion AUM hedge fund, leads his organization by drawing on [[historical_perspectives_on_technology_like_the_printing_press | historical perspectives]] to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Direct Comparisons to Past Technologies

Will explicitly states that not using AI tools today is "like refusing to use the internet in 1995 because it wasn't perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This analogy emphasizes the imperative for swift adoption, even if the technology is still evolving. He notes that the direction of travel for these tools is "very, very positive," and resisting them due to imperfections is an "excuse to ignore it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.

Previous technological shifts like the introduction of spreadsheets or email also required adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:12">[20:09:12]</a>. Just as a stock picker who couldn't use Excel became obsolete, future professionals will need to be proficient in AI tools to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. These tools provide "operating leverage," making individuals and firms more efficient and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

## Broader Periods of Transformation

Will points to the period between the American Civil War and World War I as a time of dramatic global change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:58:00">[39:58:00]</a>. During this era, technologies like railroads and transatlantic cables rapidly connected the world, leading to massive societal shifts where skills quickly became obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>. He posits that the current AI transformation will happen even faster than these past industrial revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>.

### The "Cowboy Era" Metaphor

Drawing on the metaphor of the American "cowboy era," Will notes the rapid transition from lawless frontiers to civilized areas due to developments like railroads and barbed wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>. This represents the tension between individualistic exploration on technological frontiers and the eventual need for civilization and institutionalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. Companies today, like Walleye, have the advantage of being able to "push the frontier but with resources," allowing them to not just adapt but to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:04:00">[46:04:00]</a>.

## Unchanging Human Nature and Timeless Patterns

Despite technological changes, Will believes that "human nature hasn't changed in 10,000 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:19:00">[47:19:00]</a>. He cites examples from ancient Egypt, Roman history, and Alexander the Great to illustrate timeless patterns like the "new always wants to replace the old" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>. This constant drive for renewal, akin to a forest fire burning old trees for new growth, manifests in how some individuals and firms embrace change while others cling to the past, often leading to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>. This perspective informs his belief that while history doesn't repeat itself exactly, it often "rhymes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>.

### Investing and Historical Patterns

In the context of finance, quant investing is fundamentally built on the concept that "there are patterns in history in stock prices and information that was predictive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>. While machine learning models in quant finance have long surpassed human comprehension in their complexity, the underlying principle is the reliance on these historical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:37:00">[51:37:00]</a>. Even in human-driven intuition in investing, there's a timelessness, especially in "low of large numbers situations where a machine hasn't exactly seen all the priors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>. The goal of AI tools in this context is to "enable that human to make a prediction more accurately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:18:00">[50:18:00]</a>.

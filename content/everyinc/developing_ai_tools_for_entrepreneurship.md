Nicholas Thorns, General Partner at Prehype, an incubator responsible for companies like BarkBox, Row, and Every, has been an early adopter of major technology trends, including electronic badge companies before NFTs and GPT-3 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This foresight has allowed him to deeply understand and apply these tools in his work, especially in [[using_ai_for_business_incubation | business incubation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Autos: AI-Powered Business Incubation

Thorns has launched a new company, Autos, to [[automating_entrepreneurial_processes_with_ai | automate and improve the incubation process]] using GPT-3 and GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Autos is an "AI-native" operation, with AI integrated into both its internal processes and customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This approach has drastically accelerated the path from idea to business, enabling customers to go from zero to a functioning business in approximately three days, a process that previously took months or was impossible due to lack of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

### The End-to-End AI Process

Autos leverages AI across the entire entrepreneurial journey:
*   **Idea Generation to Business Plan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
    *   **Customer Acquisition**: Ads on platforms like Instagram lead potential entrepreneurs directly into a conversational AI bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Problem Definition**: The AI asks users questions to deeply understand their target customer and the problem they aim to solve, offering different interpretations and solution styles across various business models (software, platform, product, financial, content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Automated Pitch Deck Creation**: Within minutes, a set of GPTs run in the background to generate a detailed presentation. This deck includes:
        *   Context of the problem and customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
        *   Restatement of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.
        *   Iconography, logo, and color palette generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.
        *   Proposed business names based on customer archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:03]</a>.
        *   User journey and key benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.
        *   Pricing suggestions and market size estimation, pulling data via Google searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.
        *   A to-do list for next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
    *   **User Interaction**: Users can provide feedback and edit elements like icons and pitches, leading to regeneration of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.

*   **Customer Feedback and Product Development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>
    *   **Landing Page and Domain Creation**: Upon a small payment ($30), Autos automatically creates a landing page based on the pitch deck, and even registers a domain for the new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Custom GPT for Lead Acquisition**: Entrepreneurs receive their own AI co-pilot, a hosted GPT, which can acquire and qualify leads through conversational experiences, and even begin selling aspects of their envisioned product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:00">[29:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Voice-Oriented Customer Interviews**: Users are prompted to interview themselves or share a voice-chat link with friends to gather initial customer feedback. This AI-driven interview follows a "need finding" playbook, akin to those taught at design schools, to deeply explore customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Automated Product Roadmap**: Conversations from these interviews are synthesized by AI into a product roadmap, identifying key features and organizing them in a dashboard for the entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.

### The Power of AI in Development

Nicholas Thorns, who has no formal computer science background and never programmed significantly before ChatGPT, uses AI extensively for prototyping and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. He has generated far more lines of code with ChatGPT in the last year and a half than in his entire life combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

The core of his [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | prototyping process]] involves:
1.  **Iterative Scripting with ChatGPT**: He copies and pastes existing code or requests new scripts from ChatGPT, then pastes error messages back to the AI for debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This allows him to quickly generate functional code without needing deep programming knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
2.  **Airtable as a Core Database**: Airtable serves as a central database that can be easily accessed and understood by non-technical users, including customers, for viewing lead information and chat histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Automations and API Integrations**: Airtable's scripting capabilities, combined with ChatGPT's ability to generate API calls, allow for complex automations. For instance, creating new Airtable bases with specific schemas for each customer's data, updating DNS records via API, or integrating with payment services like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
4.  **Focus on Functionality over UI**: This method prioritizes getting a working prototype over perfect UI design, which can significantly slow down development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Nicholas emphasizes that this approach allows founders to remain "first draft makers" for longer, staying closer to customer feedback and insights, which is crucial for early-stage companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities

While [[challenges_in_building_ai_tools | building AI tools]] can present issues, such as API timeouts or unexpected behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, Thorns notes that with patience and iterative debugging with ChatGPT, these can be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

AI acts as a powerful force multiplier for entrepreneurial expression, enabling individuals to create something in service of others with unprecedented speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

> "I think AI can be a force for pushing entrepreneurship to new heights... it can be just an amazing force multiplier for people's how people express themselves entrepreneurially speaking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>

This model of using tools like Airtable with ChatGPT as the "glue" to connect various third-party services offers a compelling path for non-technical individuals to [[prototyping_with_ai_in_venture_capital | prototype]] and build functional products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Once a functional prototype is established, it can then be handed off to professional developers for further productionization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

For more information, Nicholas Thorns' upcoming book, "Me, My Customer, and AI," will document this thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

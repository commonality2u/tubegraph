Developing [[AI product development | AI products]] effectively requires balancing core intuition with extensive user feedback. Products, particularly in the rapidly evolving [[impact_of_ai_on_media_and_product_development | AI]] space, need to have "soul" or a clear perspective, which intuition provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Without this internal anchor, products can become "empty," merely reacting to every piece of feedback without a coherent vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Granola's Product Development Journey

Granola, an [[AI product development | AI product]] that records meetings and generates transcripts and notes, embodies this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The company launched in May with a small team of four and quickly gained traction, partly because many venture capitalists, a key early adopter demographic, used the product themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Early Iteration and User Testing
Before its public launch, Granola spent a year in development with approximately 150 beta users providing extensive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Initially, the core interaction involved real-time [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | AI]] augmentation, where users would invoke the [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | AI]] and type keywords during meetings to generate notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. While visually appealing and effective for demos, this real-time interaction proved to be distracting in actual meetings, as users couldn't help but read and correct the [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | AI]]'s output, losing focus on the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Through this feedback process, Granola realized the need to change its interaction paradigm. They pivoted to a model where users type notes into an interface similar to Apple Notes during the meeting, and the [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | AI]] transforms these notes into polished summaries *after* the meeting ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This shift led them to cut out 50% of the features they had built, prioritizing a single, well-executed function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Incorporating User Feedback
The philosophy behind [[analyzing_customer_feedback_and_improving_business_products_with_ai | incorporating user feedback]] is not to simply implement every suggestion, but to use it to inform and refine one's own intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Direct "FaceTime" (conversations) with users is considered more valuable than written feedback, as it allows for a deeper understanding of the user's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Shadowing users in their office environment, though logistically challenging, provides super valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Companies like Granola also build products they want to use themselves, which provides an immediate feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This self-use helps in empathizing with the user experience. The goal is to build an internal mental model of what feels good or bad for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### The "Soul" of a Product
A product with "soul" possesses a clear opinion or perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. This perspective is essential for anchoring development decisions, especially when building for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. While tempting to purely design based on intuition without user input, it's "unfathomably hard to put yourself in another person's shoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. User tests help confirm or correct implicit assumptions very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

Conversely, a product development approach that solely relies on objective study of users without a guiding perspective can lead to "blankness" from users, as they may not explicitly know their problems or desired solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Bringing a specific perspective to user interactions is crucial for effective learning and intuition training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Managing Product Thinking
Effective product thinking, which relies on intuition and feeling, requires dedicated "space" away from daily busy work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. Packing schedules with meetings, as seen in some large organizations, can eliminate time for true product thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. It's not just about schedule time, but also "emotional time or emotional space" to process feelings about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. Understanding "how did this make me feel?" is a fundamental aspect of building great products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

## Strategic Considerations for AI Product Development

### Scaling Beyond Early Adopters
Granola initially gained traction with startup founders and investorsâ€”users who need to make "high leverage decisions on the backs of meetings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While early adopters provide valuable feedback and evangelize the product, a key challenge is expanding beyond this initial cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

To avoid being pigeonholed in a specific vertical, it's important to diversify the user base early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Focusing on early adopters for a period is beneficial because they evangelize the product and can eventually lead to broader adoption as their companies grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. However, it would be a mistake to pursue a mass-market product too early, as it can dilute what makes the product special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Advantages of Startups in AI
[[Building AI products with lean teams | Startups]] have distinct advantages in the [[ai_product_development | AI product development]] space:
*   **Cost Management & Iteration:** [[Developing AI tools for entrepreneurship | AI]] is expensive to run today, but costs are expected to drop significantly in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Startups can leverage this by using frontier models and not worrying about current high costs for a smaller user base, trusting that costs will plummet as they scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Risk Appetite:** Large companies, serving hundreds of millions of users, have much lower risk appetites and more layers of approval, hindering their ability to "do weird stuff" or quickly adapt to new [[impact_of_ai_on_media_and_product_development | AI]] paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Startups with fewer users can take more risks, explore new product categories, and quickly test new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.
*   **Rapid Innovation:** The [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | AI]] technology is changing rapidly. Startups can anticipate future capabilities (e.g., lower inference costs, larger context windows, better transcription) and build products based on those future premises, rather than being limited by current technological constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. This also means not solving problems that future model improvements will inherently address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.

### Specialization vs. Generalization
A key consideration for [[ai_product_development | AI startups]] is whether to pursue specialization or generalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. While general-purpose [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | AI]] tools (like large language models) benefit from user convenience and accessibility, there is a strong need for specialization in specific tasks or professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.

Startups focused on building tools for professionals or experts (e.g., Photoshop for designers) are better positioned to differentiate themselves, as quality and specialized output are paramount in those domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. Granola aims to be in this category, moving beyond just meeting notes to help users become "10 times better" at work centered around relationships and judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

The vision for Granola is to remove busy work (e.g., drafting follow-up emails, scheduling) by taking users "85% of the way there," while ensuring the final product reflects the user's unique "spin" and judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. This approach differs from the "AI agent" paradigm, where the [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | AI]] does *all* the work, which may not be what users truly desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.

The rapid evolution of [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] has highlighted the critical need for standardized protocols and robust security models to ensure their widespread utility and safe integration into existing digital ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Agentic Web: A New Ecosystem
For [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] to be truly useful, they must be able to take action on behalf of users, utilize tools, make system changes, and consult diverse information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This necessitates an "agentic web" ecosystem that functions similarly to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Key requirements for the agentic web include:
*   **Interconnectivity** Agents need to be able to communicate with existing websites and APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Standard Protocols** The emergence of simple, composable open protocols, such as MCP (Multi-Modal Communication Protocol) and NL Web, are crucial. MCP serves a similar purpose to HTTP on the internet, while NL Web is akin to HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. These protocols allow [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] to access and interact with information and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Agentic Memory** Current [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] often operate transactionally, losing memory after a single task. Better agentic memory is needed to enable the delegation of increasingly complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Why Standard Protocols are Crucial
Without standard protocols, inefficiencies in [[challenges_in_building_ai_tools | building AI tools]] and systems become rampant. Conway's Law, which states that systems reflect the communication structures of the organizations that build them, applies to agent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. To avoid "shipping the org chart" and enable efficient development, internal systems need to speak a standard protocol to all internal [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Security Models for AI Systems
The security model for the agentic web is a significant area of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. While the internet has established security mechanisms like the same-origin policy, new models are required for [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] that can execute actions and access diverse data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

Key aspects of agent security include:
*   **Agent Identities** [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | Agents]] need identities to build entitlement systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This allows for defining which resources an agent can access on behalf of a user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Permission Requests** [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | Agents]] should be able to query systems to understand what entitlements they need for a task and then request explicit permission from the user or system administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Open Development** Security models for the agentic web should be developed in an open, non-proprietary way to foster community consensus and widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Open vs. Verticalized Models
There is a debate between verticalized models (where a single entity owns the model, UI, and applications, ensuring security) and open models (which allow for greater innovation but face more complex security challenges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

The speaker argues that this is a false dichotomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Open systems offer significant advantages due to permissionless innovation, allowing individuals to build and distribute things without gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. It is believed that robust security can still be achieved in open systems by leveraging AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. For example, a personal agent could monitor communication modalities, assess risks, and triangulate suspicious activity, much like a human would in a security incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## The Future of AI Systems and Agents
The future of [[ai_in_personal_and_professional_settings | AI in personal and professional settings]] will likely involve a diverse ecosystem of [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]], rather than a single "agent to rule them all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This diversity will be driven by companies and developers focusing on understanding and solving specific user problems with nuanced solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

### Predictions for the Next Year
*   **Increased Capability and Affordability**: [[experiments_and_tools_in_ai_research | AI technology]] will continue to become cheaper and more capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Those waiting for the technology to be "ready" will fall behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Interaction**: As the agentic web matures and models improve their reasoning and planning capabilities, interactions with [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] will shift from synchronous (immediate prompt-response) to asynchronous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. Users will be able to delegate complex tasks to [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] that may take significant time to execute, integrating multiple calls and iterating on actions before presenting a final output or requiring further user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to build an environment where [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | agents]] can effectively integrate into daily workflows and systems, enabling users to delegate more complex tasks and receive more comprehensive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

The concepts of max and min functions offer a framework for understanding different types of problems and goals, particularly in areas like hiring, decision-making, and even dating. This idea was inspired by a conversation regarding hiring at the Woolworth Building in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## What is a Max Function?
A [[the_concept_of_max_function_vs_min_function | Max function]] describes situations where the primary goal is to find the single best or highest value, and the quality of other options is largely irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. In a Max function scenario, only the top value truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

### Examples of Max Functions
*   **Hiring a specific role:** When hiring one person, such as a new CEO for a company, the focus is on finding that one excellent candidate. The fact that 99 other applicants might be unsuitable doesn't matter as long as the one person chosen is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Dating/Marriage:** In the context of marriage, one typically seeks to marry only one person, making it a Max function where the selection of that single individual is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## What is a Min Function (or its Opposite)?
While the term "Min function" is proposed as the opposite of a Max function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, the concept encompasses scenarios where a broader range of values, an average, or the interaction of multiple components is important, rather than just a single best one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This can also be thought of as a "distributed" function or one concerned with the "broad swath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Examples of Non-Max Functions
*   **Designing furniture in a room:** This is not a Max function because it requires many different pieces of furniture to play together and complement each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The overall harmony and collective utility are more important than the individual "best" piece.

## Applying the Framework
Understanding whether a situation operates as a [[the_concept_of_max_function_vs_min_function | Max function]] or its opposite—where averages or multiple contributions matter—can provide a useful worldview for approaching projects and working arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. By asking if a project is a Max function or "this other thing," individuals can gain clarity on the optimal strategy and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

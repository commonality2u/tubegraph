The field of [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI in filmmaking]] is still in its early stages, with tools continually improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Current limitations exist, such as clip length, but creative techniques are being employed to overcome these.

## Limitations and Workarounds in [[ai_in_film_production | AI in Film Production]]

Currently, AI tools have limitations on the length of generated video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Runway** currently limits clips to 4 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Pika Labs** allows extensions up to 15 seconds, but this can lead to a loss of fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

To circumvent these limitations and enhance clip quality, filmmakers can use tools like Topaz Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Upscaling**: Clips can be exported at 4K or 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Frame Rate Manipulation**: A 24 frames per second (fps) clip can be converted to 60 fps or even 120 fps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This allows for slowing down the footage in post-production, effectively extending the clip's duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This technique helps in [[creating_cinematic_images_with_ai | creating cinematic images with AI]] by allowing more control over motion and pacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Storytelling and [[editing_techniques_in_ai_films | Editing Techniques in AI Films]]

Manipulating clip length through frame rate and post-production slowing allows for more varied pacing in films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Filmmakers can mix extended clips with quicker cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   This approach makes the storytelling and [[ai_in_filmmaking | filmmaking]] more akin to traditional television and film, reminiscent of styles seen in Tony Scott films like *Man on Fire* or Zack Snyder's *300* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   [[editing_techniques_in_ai_films | Editing]] is a crucial component in [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI filmmaking]], enabling filmmakers to construct narratives using clips of varying lengths (e.g., 8-second clips alongside 1-second clips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## AI Voice Generation

AI tools like **11 Labs** offer advanced voice generation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   While some AI voices can sound artificial, 11 Labs features a "speech to speech" function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   This function allows a user to act out dialogue, and the AI converts it into the voice of a different character, maintaining the human cadence and emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For example, in the film "Borrowing Time," the voices for characters like the judge and the mother were generated using the filmmaker's own voice through 11 Labs' "voice to voice" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   For naturalistic narration, using one's plain voice with its natural pauses can sound more authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

The pursuit of significant investment opportunities, akin to the successful [[nvidias_success_and_identifying_similar_investment_opportunities | Nvidia investment]] made in January 2019 when shares were $33 and later rose to $800, drives the exploration of various investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This search involves leveraging AI tools like Gemini to identify potential "10-baggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Evolution of an Investment Thesis
The initial investment thesis, exemplified by Nvidia, focused on finding companies that were:
*   **Trading down suddenly due to temporary distress**: Nvidia's price dip in 2019 was attributed to the trade war, considered a temporary risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Possessing a strong market position**: Nvidia had a powerful position due to its proprietary GPU architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Benefiting from increasing demand**: The need for high-powered CPUs due to machine learning and gaming was expected to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Having a margin of safety**: A significant price drop (e.g., 20-30%) offers protection if the analysis is slightly off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

This criteria later evolved into a three-part framework:
1.  **Exogenous Shock**: The company's stock is trading down due to external factors, not internal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.
2.  **Key Bottleneck Position**: The company controls a crucial part of its value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
3.  **Highly Scalable Business Model**: The business can grow significantly (e.g., 100x in a year) without hitting major bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

## Identifying SPAC Companies for Investment
The search for investments eventually led to considering **SPACs** (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) that went public around 2020-2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The rationale was that many SPACs "got pretty wrecked" in the public market and became "particularly small cap," potentially presenting undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. The goal was to find a SPAC with speculative technology that, if successful, could offer massive upside scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

### Case Study: 23andMe (ME)
After reviewing a list of SPACs, 23andMe (ME) emerged as a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.
*   **Stock Status**: Trading at $0.58 with a market cap of $270 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.
*   **Exogenous Shock**: The company was facing multiple class-action lawsuits due to a data breach and breakup speculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>. It also received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ, requiring its share price to recover within 180 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.
*   **Scalable Business Model/Bottleneck Potential**: The core idea was that genetic data could become significantly more valuable with [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI advancements]], specifically Transformers, allowing for easier processing and predictive insights not possible before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. The company was also attempting to pivot into a healthcare company with drug candidates in early-stage human trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.
*   **Investment Decision**: Despite high uncertainty and the "worst characteristics" of past unsuccessful investments, a $1,000 investment was made in 23andMe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Surprisingly, the position was exited for a 9% profit shortly after, despite a 4% intra-week dip, highlighting the unpredictable nature of day trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the Investment Process
The experience revealed several key takeaways for [[venture_capital_investing_strategies | venture capital investing strategies]] and [[venture_capital_decisionmaking_and_ai | decision-making]]:

### Psychological Factors in Investing
*   **Patience is Key**: Even with a solid strategy, suitable opportunities may not always be present. Resisting the psychological pressure to invest prematurely is crucial for a good investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.
*   **Waiting for "Fat Pitches"**: The best opportunities, like the Nvidia or Meta stock price depressions, are obvious when they appear, and investors need to be prepared to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>.

### [[impact_of_ai_on_venture_capital_decisionmaking | Impact of AI on Venture Capital Decisionmaking]]
*   **Context Window Benefits**: Large context windows in LLMs like Gemini offer significant benefits for [[analyzing_energy_sector_investment_potential | analyzing large datasets]] like earnings call transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>.
*   **Content Access Limitations**: A major challenge is the difficulty in easily accessing large amounts of relevant, up-to-date content (e.g., analyst reports, real-time stock data) to fully utilize LLM capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:18">[01:24:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:32">[01:26:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:34">[01:26:34]</a>.
*   **LLM Caution**: LLMs tend to be overly cautious and reluctant to make direct recommendations, likely due to liability concerns, which can hinder their usefulness for direct investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.
*   **Opportunity for Riskier Models**: This caution by mainstream LLMs creates an opportunity for developers to build models willing to provide riskier or more direct results, potentially offering greater utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.

## Rethinking the Investment: Google (GOOGL)
Following the 23andMe trade, a new potential investment in Google (GOOGL) was considered, aligning more closely with the refined thesis:
*   **Exogenous Shock**: Google experienced a negative perception wave due to issues with Gemini and disappointing earnings, leading to a loss of $70 billion in market value in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:25">[01:30:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. Investors perceived higher capex needs and challenges in monetizing [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI-based search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>.
*   **Highly Scalable Business Model**: Google's search model is considered one of the most scalable business models ever conceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>.
*   **Key Bottleneck/Tailwind**: Despite increased compute costs for LLM-driven search, Google is advantaged by its internal semiconductor design (TPUs) and cloud infrastructure, positioning it to benefit significantly from the [[the_changing_landscape_of_venture_capital_with_ai_advancements | AI wave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:33:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:21">[01:33:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:24">[01:33:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.

This investment, though not a deep value play in terms of current stock price being significantly down, aligns with the long-term potential seen in past companies like Microsoft and Apple, which navigated rocky periods to achieve strong growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:12">[01:34:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:13">[01:34:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:28">[01:34:28]</a>. The ultimate investment in Google was made with a $1,087 transfer of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:22">[01:35:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>.

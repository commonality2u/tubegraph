The traditional intensity of "disciplinarianism" within academia, where fields like political science or [[philosophical_approaches_to_change | philosophy]] exist in strict silos, is a point of critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. There is a strong argument that every 25 years, academic disciplines should be re-evaluated, potentially "blowing them all up and reconstituting them in various ways" to foster better thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The most interesting insights and advancements often come from individuals who are "blending across disciplines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Benefits of Blending Disciplines

*   **Evolving Knowledge**: The question of how we evolve what we know is fundamental to [[philosophical_approaches_to_change | philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This evolution is often spurred by new instrumentation in science, which changes the definition of what it means to be human and how we perceive truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Innovation**: Seminal works that weave together disparate fields, such as mathematics, music, and art, demonstrate the power of interdisciplinary thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. Such minds are described as those that "invent new minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
*   **Addressing Weaknesses of Disciplinarianism**: While rigid disciplinary boundaries offer some strengths, they also present significant weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. A key aspect of this is how technology changes our understanding of language, truth, and argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

### Philosophy's Role in Multidisciplinary Progress

Historically, core philosophical questions have led to various scientific disciplines, encompassing everything from the physical to the biological world, including concepts like germ theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. [[philosophical_approaches_to_change | Philosophy]] serves as a root discipline for many other fields, influencing how we approach economics, game theory, political science, and the conflict of nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

A broader application of [[philosophical_approaches_to_change | philosophy]], moving beyond abstract thought experiments, is crucial. For example, instead of merely cogitating, philosophers should actively engage with how technology shapes our ways of knowing, perceiving, communicating, and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. If philosophers were more engaged in this manner, they might have played a greater role in the development of [[practical_approaches_to_ai | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

Ultimately, it is beneficial to be a "philosopher out in the world" to some degree, applying philosophical thinking to real-world problems and technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This practical, engaged approach to [[philosophical_approaches_to_change | philosophy]] drives dynamic progress and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.

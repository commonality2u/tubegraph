[[ai_in_film_making | AI in filmmaking]] is emerging as a powerful tool, particularly for independent creators looking to visualize and pitch their stories to a wider audience or secure funding for larger projects.

## Personal Story and Inspiration
The inspiration for one creator's AI-generated film came from a story his father told him about growing up during the segregation era and Jim Crow laws. His father, at age 12 or 13, faced severe trouble for winking or whistling at a white woman in a convenience store, narrowly escaping the fate of others who were murdered or imprisoned for similar alleged offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This story, coupled with a love for sci-fi, led to the idea of a lawyer going back in time to represent his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## [[ai_in_film_production | AI in Film Production]] for Visualization and Pitching
The creator emphasized that the power of [[ai_in_film_production | AI in film production]] allowed him to visualize this complex narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Traditional Hollywood studios might reject such a "period piece" from a non-established director like Steven Spielberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, [[ai_in_film_production | AI in film production]] enabled him to visualize it in a compelling way, even earning recognition from Forbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The use of [[ai_in_film_production | AI in film production]] serves as a crucial "leg into making a traditional movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. As a traditional filmmaker first, the creator views his AI-generated works as intellectual property (IP) and an "extension of my creative ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This approach has successfully attracted the attention of "A-level producers and execs in Hollywood," particularly with projects like "Dismal Swamp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### AI-Generated Sizzle Reels
The primary purpose of using [[ai_in_film_production | AI in film production]] in "Dismal Swamp" was to create a one-minute "sizzle reel" or "ritric" using AI-generated footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Traditionally, directors in Hollywood create sizzle reels by compiling clips from other directors' movies to pitch an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, [[ai_in_film_production | AI in film production]] allows creators to feed their own scripts into prompts and generate footage "based on all the stuff that was in my head," a capability not widely available even three to five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

This method mirrors developments in writing, where short-form content like tweets or blog posts serve as low-cost, quick tests for larger projects like articles or books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These smaller pieces can be easily published without gatekeepers, and if successful, can lead to larger deals or self-publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

While independent filmmaking has always allowed for some low-budget creation with just a camera, complex elements like actors or special effects remained out of reach for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The new set of [[ai_in_film_making | AI in filmmaking]] tools makes a wider range of short films feasible, enabling them to act as "precursors to like larger better funded projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, similar to how blog posts lead to books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This represents a significant shift towards [[ai_as_a_tool_for_democratizing_film_production | AI as a tool for democratizing film production]].

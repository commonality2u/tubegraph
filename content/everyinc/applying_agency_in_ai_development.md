When encountering external circumstances, such as advancements in AI, one can either perceive them as detrimental to personal agency or as opportunities for transformation and enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Approaching new developments with the mindset that they are "taking my agency" is seen as counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on how to use these circumstances to [[super_agency_and_adapting_to_ai_developments | transform and extend one's agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Understanding Agency

Agency is described as an internal, aesthetic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. A useful framework for navigating situations, including those involving AI, is the catechism: "the strength to change the things I can the tolerance to live the things I can't and the wisdom to know the difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This principle helps in distinguishing between what is within one's control and what is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This perspective, perhaps influenced by activities like playing board games, fosters a sense of awareness regarding controllable and uncontrollable elements in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Practical Application in AI

For professionals like product managers or designers, applying this concept of agency to the evolving landscape of AI involves thinking about how to orient oneself to AI developments in a [[practical_approaches_to_ai | concrete way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It prompts the question of how to [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | instantiate this "compass"]] of agency in one's approach to work and life as AI continues to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

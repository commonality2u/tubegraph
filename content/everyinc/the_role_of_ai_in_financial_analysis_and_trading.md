Walleye, a hedge fund with nearly $10 billion in assets under management, is spearheading a significant shift towards an AI-first culture, particularly in its approach to financial analysis and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. This strategic pivot is driven by the conviction that ignoring AI tools means "leaving money on the table" by being slower, less smart, and less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Walleye's AI-First Culture

Walleye's CEO, Will, has taken a proactive stance, circulating a memo to the entire firm titled "AI at Walleye, a challenge to all of us," which was notably written using [[Use of AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT in analyzing stocks | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The message is clear: using [[Use of AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT in analyzing stocks | ChatGPT]] and other AI tools is not cheating; it is an essential part of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Not using these tools is likened to refusing the internet in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

The firm is building a culture around [[The impact of AI on business models and investment | AI]] from the top down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
Mandatory training is being implemented for every person at the firm, regardless of department or technical background, to ensure a base-level proficiency in [[Use of AI in Writing and Investment | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. This initiative aims to alleviate anxiety among employees about job security by demonstrating that the firm will provide the necessary tools and training for adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>.

To foster adoption, Walleye has made [[The role and capabilities of AI agents | AI]] use more social, with weekly internal meetups to discuss prompts and use cases, and leaderboards to track tool usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. The CEO acts as the "chief [[The role and capabilities of AI agents | AI evangelist]]" to set the tone and encourage experimentation, even if tools are imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>.

## AI in Financial Analysis and Trading

Walleye has been using advanced statistics and [[Advantages of AI in data analysis | AI]] in its pure quant trading business for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has dramatically enhanced the ability to process unstructured data and incorporate it into trading signals, particularly for sentiment analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

The firm's most advanced internal [[The role and capabilities of AI agents | AI project]], called "Current," was initiated two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This tool is used by fundamental long-short stock pickers to enhance efficiency, especially during earnings periods when information flow is rapid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:19">[02:49:19]</a>. "Current" helps analysts by taking in analyst notes, broker information PDFs, and earnings transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:47">[03:09:47]</a>. It provides real analysis and meaning rather than just summarization, helping human investors gain an information advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:56">[02:50:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:21">[02:51:21]</a>.

## Broader Data Strategy and Applications

Walleye is moving towards a comprehensive data strategy, referred to as "the Borg" or "the collective," to record and process nearly every bit of information flowing through the firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:12">[03:02:12]</a>. This includes internal communications like Zoom meetings and calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. LLMs continuously process these transcripts to provide insights, aid memory, and offer predictive capabilities, particularly for the risk team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:33">[02:57:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:36">[02:59:36]</a>.

The goal is to gather all data into a "data lake" that can be easily accessed and processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:09">[03:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>. This concept extends beyond investment teams to all departments, including accounting, finance, compliance, and legal, where [[Using AI for business and decision making | AI]] can assist with analysis and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>. The ultimate objective is to link textual data with numerical data (market, internal, accounting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a>, enabling powerful [[Advantages of AI in data analysis | data analysis]] and fostering an "AI-first" business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:09">[03:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:46">[03:08:46]</a>.

## Impact on Work and Skills

Using [[Use of AI in Writing and Investment | AI for writing]] and communication, such as emails or memos, can reduce tasks from hours to minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>. This efficiency allows individuals to focus on higher-level tasks, critical thinking, and creativity, rather than mechanical typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[02:02:20]</a>.

Will strongly believes that while [[Use of AI in Writing and Investment | AI tools]] don't negate the need for thinking, they provide more time for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:02">[03:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. The challenge is ensuring that individuals still convey concepts clearly and do not outsource their entire brain to a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:15">[03:11:15]</a>.

> "Using Chat GBT is not cheating. That's a non-applicable idea from academia, where using AI to do homework or take tests is actually cheating. In the real world, using AI is like taking a magical elixir that makes you 20% smarter instantly or a lot more. So, why wouldn't you use it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>

The firm emphasizes that jobs are not disappearing but changing, requiring employees to adapt and learn new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. Just as proficiency in Excel became essential for stock pickers, so too will be the ability to use [[Challenges and considerations in stock trading using AI | AI tools]] for competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Leaders must set the tone, demonstrating acceptance of imperfect tools and encouraging a "have at it" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>.

## Historical Context and Future Outlook

Walleye's leadership views the current AI transformation through a historical lens, comparing it to periods of rapid change like that between the American Civil War and World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. Just as industries were disrupted by the advent of railroads, transatlantic cables, and barbed wire, [[The impact of AI on business models and investment | AI]] is accelerating similar shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

While humans retain an edge in situations requiring intuition and dealing with "fuzzy mess," [[Using AI for business and decision making | AI tools]] can augment this, helping to identify intuitive answers that might not have been apparent otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:07">[05:52:07]</a>.

> "It's impossible for me not to believe that in five years firms that do what we do won't be heavily heavily integrated with best of breed AI technology across the firm not just for investment for non-investment purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>

The future of companies will involve many employees, but a significant portion will be machines rather than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:36">[04:40:36]</a>. This requires continuous adaptation and training to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:14">[04:42:14]</a>. Walleye's approach is to embrace this change with an optimistic tone, seeing it as an opportunity for progress and growth rather than a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. The CEO feels a responsibility to prepare Walleye's people for what's coming, ensuring they are equipped to thrive in an [[The impact of AI on business models and investment | AI-first world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

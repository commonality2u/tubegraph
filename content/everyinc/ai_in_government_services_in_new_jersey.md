New Jersey views Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a significant tool for both [[economic_development_and_ai_in_new_jersey | economic development]] and improving government services for its residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:71">[02:51:71]</a>. Governor Phil Murphy notes that while AI has not personally impacted his day-to-day life, it is a substantial part of his broader focus as governor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>.

## AI in Delivering Government Services

New Jersey is actively integrating AI to enhance the efficiency and intelligence of government service delivery, with the goal of becoming a national leader in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:69">[11:39:69]</a>.

Key initiatives include:
*   **Employee Training** The state is training all 61,000 of its employees in generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This training introduces employees to an AI co-pilot, a customized version of tools like ChatGPT, to help them perform tasks more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:13">[13:01:13]</a>. The aim is to make staff more comfortable with AI and enable them to "upskill their daily lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>, allowing them to focus on more strategic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:32:00">[41:32:00]</a>.
*   **Call Centers** AI is being used in call centers to answer resident questions more quickly, particularly for common inquiries related to services like the Motor Vehicles Commission (MVC) or unemployment insurance benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:44">[16:08:44]</a>. Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of providing most answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:10">[16:16:10]</a>.
*   **Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC)** While improvements at the MVC largely predate AI, stemming from pandemic-era operational reorientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:88">[14:50:88]</a>, AI's role is in preempting common issues. For example, AI can guide users on necessary documents like proof of address before they visit in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:19">[15:54:19]</a>. The MVC now predominantly operates online or by appointment for in-person visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:44">[15:23:44]</a>.

Governor Murphy believes that the state is still in the early stages of AI integration, with much more potential to be realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:46">[16:30:46]</a>.

## Regulatory Framework for AI

New Jersey advocates for a national, if not international, framework for AI regulation, believing that leaving states to be the primary "regulatory nexus" would be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:25">[04:23:25]</a>. The governor argues that a patchwork of state-specific rules for something as pervasive and central as AI would be impractical for businesses and residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:20">[05:50:20]</a>. The European Union's recent regulatory paradigm is seen as potentially stifling to industry development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:14">[03:53:14]</a>.

While acknowledging a need for a national framework, New Jersey still believes states can contribute to the regulatory discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:26">[11:30:26]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and Job Impact

New Jersey's government is keenly aware of public anxieties surrounding AI, particularly regarding job displacement and ethical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:43">[37:29:43]</a>. The state's primary goal is to promote "upskilling" rather than job replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:29:92">[38:29:92]</a>. This means enabling employees to be more productive and focus on higher-level, more strategic tasks, while AI handles mundane or repetitive elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:44">[38:56:44]</a>.

The government aims to alleviate fears by promoting familiarity with AI through training and demonstrating its practical benefits in professional lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:13:42">[41:13:42]</a>. The goal is to show that AI expands human creativity rather than replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Expertise

New Jersey relies on experts to drive specific AI decisions, such as Beth Novak, who serves as the state's senior AI strategist, drawing on her experience advising leaders like Barack Obama and Angela Merkel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:14">[17:35:14]</a>. Governor Murphy provides broad directional input, particularly on the [[economic_development_and_ai_in_new_jersey | economic development]] aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.

## [[economic_development_and_ai_in_new_jersey | Economic Development]] and Innovation Hubs

A significant part of New Jersey's AI strategy is to foster [[economic_development_and_ai_in_new_jersey | economic development]] and innovation within the state. Recognizing its existing strengths in talent and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:40">[10:30:40]</a>, New Jersey aims to regain its historical position as a leader in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:40">[22:21:40]</a>.

The state's approach involves establishing "Strategic Innovation Centers," which are partnerships typically involving a university, a large corporate entity, the state's Economic Development Authority (EDA), and an accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:17">[19:46:17]</a>. These centers often include physical locations, financial commitments from the state, and private capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:44">[23:02:44]</a>.

The **New Jersey AI Hub** is one such initiative, a venture between Princeton University, Microsoft, and CoreWeave (a hyperscaler headquartered in New Jersey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>. This hub is intended to be a nexus for research, student participation, corporate idea exchange, and, most importantly, to accelerate the startup community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.

New Jersey's strengths for AI innovation include:
*   **Talent and Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:69">[33:39:69]</a>.
*   **Strong Innovation Economy** particularly in STEM fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Existing Industries** such as pharmaceutical, bio-life sciences, tech, telecom, green economy, film/television ([[ai_in_filmmaking | AI in filmmaking]]), digital, fintech, and sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Academic Excellence** exemplified by Princeton University, which is seen as a strong "horse in that race" for AI research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>.
*   **High Concentration of Scientists** and research professionals per square mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:74">[36:59:74]</a>.

The state aims to play to its strengths rather than trying to become something it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>. This strategy has seen New Jersey return to the top three American states for venture capital destination in the first half of 2024, behind only California and New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:97">[22:01:97]</a>.

One specific area of focus for AI application, particularly in the bio-life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, is **drug discovery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. AI is expected to be a "huge weapon" in improving the success rate of drug research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.

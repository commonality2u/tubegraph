The advent of AI, particularly models like ChatGPT, has provoked a complex emotional response, ranging from excitement to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This emotional roller coaster stems from AI's ability to challenge our fundamental [[what_it_means_to_be_human_in_the_age_of_ai | conception of ourselves]] and what makes us unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Definition of Intellect

For millennia, human identity has been intricately linked to the intellect, often serving as the distinguishing factor between humans and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Aristotle**, 2,000 years ago, stated that "the life of the intellect is the best and the pleasantest for man, for the intellect more than anything else is man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   The playwright **Anton Chekhov**, two millennia later, echoed this sentiment, writing that "the intellect draws a sharp line between animals and man and suggests the divinity of the latter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

This emphasis on intellect has become even more salient as economies have shifted from industrial labor to knowledge work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. If our value and self-definition are tied to what we know, the ability of AI to "write and worse think" can be profoundly unsettling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Redefining Intellect in the Age of AI

Initially, the speaker experienced dread when encountering ChatGPT, wondering about the future of writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, this has evolved into excitement and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The belief is that understanding how large language models (LLMs) work can help redefine our view of ourselves and our capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

For the purpose of understanding the [[role_of_ai_in_redefining_human_intelligence_and_communication | impact of AI]], intellect can be loosely defined as "that thing that humans uniquely have that animals don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This fuzzy definition explains why initial encounters with ChatGPT feel threatening, as it encroaches on abilities previously considered unique to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. To overcome this, we must redefine intellect to create a new separation between human uniqueness and AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The "Pharmacological Dissection" Analogy

Psychology offers a precedent for redefining fuzzy concepts through technology. The discovery of lithium's effect on mental illness provides a useful analogy for how AI can help "dissect" our understanding of the intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

*   **Dr. J.F. Cade's Discovery**: In the late 1940s, Australian doctor J.F. Cade discovered that the urine of manic patients was toxic to guinea pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He found elevated uric acid levels and hypothesized it caused the toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Accidental Finding**: While injecting uric acid dissolved in a lithium carbonate solution into guinea pigs, Cade observed that the pigs became remarkably calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Clinical Application**: Cade then injected lithium into his manic patients, which miraculously resolved their mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Pharmacological Dissection**: Lithium's ability to treat only manic depression (bipolar disorder) and not schizophrenia helped differentiate these conditions, which were previously thought to be similar with common underlying psychological causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Lithium acted as a "lever" and a "new lens" to understand the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Similarly, understanding what ChatGPT does can help redefine and clarify our fuzzy concept of intellect, preserving our sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## What ChatGPT Does

Technically, ChatGPT excels at "next token prediction" â€“ predicting the next words in a sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. In practice, this means language models are adept at reformatting and reconstituting existing knowledge in new, useful ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Cognitive scientist Alison Gopnik describes LLMs as:
*   "Technologies that enhance cultural transmission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   "Powerful and efficient imitation engines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

LLMs are seen as extensions of previous technological revolutions like the written word, printing press, and the internet, all of which facilitated the efficient transfer of information and coordination among humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. They serve as engines for cultural evolution and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

A key distinction is that language models are not good at discovering new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Their strength lies in taking the sum total of existing human knowledge and presenting it in the appropriate format for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Their ability to transmit existing information into the right context far surpasses any prior innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Simply put, ChatGPT is a highly effective summarizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Given that the totality of human knowledge now outstrips our ability to use it, LLMs are crucial for making collective knowledge accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## The Intellect Refined: Subtracting Summarizing

Recognizing ChatGPT primarily as a summarizer leads to a re-evaluation of personal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Much of daily work, such as writing emails, articles, or code, involves summarizing existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. While this realization can initially cause renewed anxiety about one's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, the speaker argues that it's fantastic to have a tool that can handle this "creative drudgery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

By offloading summarizing tasks to AI, individuals can focus on other, more unique and interesting aspects of their work, such as:
*   Life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   Emotional experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   Directing and deciding the quality of summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>
*   Becoming an editor or manager of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>

This process allows for the "subtraction" of summarizing as a core skill from one's definition of intellect, making it no longer central to one's identity or sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This shift allows one's sense of self to heal and highlights the richness and value that remain in human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. ChatGPT, in this context, acts as a "lever that becomes a new lens" for self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Human Adaptability and the [[What it means to be human in the age of AI | Future of Identity]]

The definition of human uniqueness is flexible and adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. What humans define as distinct often changes in response to new technologies and societal contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

While acknowledging that many jobs today are primarily about summarizing and may change or disappear due to AI's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, this **[[impact_of_ai_on_future_work_and_the_economy | societal challenge]]** is distinct from the underlying human sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The intellect can remain intact, albeit slightly changed, in a world with language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Culture, Technology, and Human Nature

Joseph Henrich's book, *The Weirdest People in the World*, illustrates how human beings adapt to their culture and surrounding technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **William Buckley's Story**: English bricklayer and convict William Buckley escaped to the Australian wilderness in 1803 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Unlike his friends who perished, Buckley survived because he was adopted by an Aboriginal tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Cultural Technology**: Despite being genetically similar, Buckley and his friends lacked the "cultural technologies" (beliefs, norms, ideas) that allowed the Aboriginal tribe to thrive in that environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Brain Rewiring**: Henrich argues that humans have evolved brains that effectively learn the necessary cultural elements for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Importantly, culture doesn't just download "cultural software"; it "rewires our brains and alters our biology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

This highlights that our species, psychology, brains, bodies, and biology are all shaped by culture, which in turn is largely shaped by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. ChatGPT is simply the latest in a long line of cultural and technological advancements that have altered what it means to be human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. AI is already hooking into our biology, and the focus should be on using it to enhance richness and beauty in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

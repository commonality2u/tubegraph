[[ai_in_filmmaking | AI in filmmaking]] is revolutionizing the way filmmakers pitch ideas, allowing creators to visualize concepts that might otherwise be overlooked by traditional Hollywood gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This approach enables filmmakers to present compelling visual proof of concept, potentially attracting higher-level producers and executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Overcoming Traditional Hurdles

Filmmakers often face skepticism when pitching unique or challenging concepts, especially if they are not established directors like Steven Spielberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. For example, a sci-fi period piece based on a nuanced historical family story might cause executives to "yawn" during a pitch meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, the ability to visualize such a story using [[creating_cinematic_images_with_ai | AI]] tools can make it appear "really interesting" and lead to a different reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Case Study: The Father's Story

One filmmaker developed a concept based on a story his father told him about growing up during the segregation era, where a seemingly minor act could lead to severe consequences, such as imprisonment or worse, for a Black man accused of interacting inappropriately with a white woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The filmmaker, a "huge sci-fi nerd," envisioned a time-travel scenario where a lawyer from the present could go back to represent his father in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This unique blend of historical drama and science fiction, initially difficult to pitch in Hollywood, became viable through [[creating_cinematic_experiences_with_ai_tools | AI visuals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The AI-generated visualization of this concept even gained attention from Forbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Case Study: Dismal Swamp

Another example is a project called "Dismal Swamp," where [[creative_storytelling_through_ai_technologies | AI]] was used to create a one-minute "sizzle reel" or "ritric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Traditionally, directors create sizzle reels by cutting together footage from other movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, with [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]], scripts can be fed into prompts to generate footage directly from the filmmaker's original ideas, a capability that was not available even a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This approach successfully garnered the attention of "pretty A-level producers and execs in Hollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## AI as a Precursor to Traditional Film

For filmmakers who prioritize traditional filmmaking, [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] serves as a powerful tool for developing intellectual property (IP) and extending creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. AI-generated visuals can act as "precursors" to larger, better-funded traditional projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This concept mirrors how writers use short-form content like tweets or blog posts to test ideas before writing full books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These smaller, quicker, and cheaper creations eliminate the need for traditional gatekeepers, allowing creators to gauge audience interest and attract deals for larger projects, or even self-publish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

While [[role_of_ai_in_lowbudget_filmmaking | indie filmmaking]] has always allowed for some independent creation with limited resources, [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] tools significantly broaden the scope of what can be achieved without actors, special effects, or large budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This development indicates a significant [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_filmmaking | shift in the film industry]], offering new avenues for creative expression and project development.

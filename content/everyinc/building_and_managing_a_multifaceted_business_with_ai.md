Donnie, creator of the Nervous System Mastery course and host of the Curious Humans podcast, describes his business model as a "steward of this emerging ecosystem" due to the variety of projects he manages simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This approach stands in contrast to traditional startup advice that emphasizes hyper-focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. For Donnie, optimizing for "aliveness" and maintaining energy for his work is paramount, trusting that this feeds into his creations and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

## AI as an Enabler for Polymathic Entrepreneurship

Artificial intelligence has been a significant enabler for Donnie to manage his diverse interests and projects. He notes that AI allows him to become "80% good at all of the various different hats" he wears, especially in areas where he is not an expert, such as marketing or business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. AI significantly reduces friction by assisting with tasks like business administration, taxes, and even finding an executive assistant, allowing him to perform the work of "five to six people or more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

## Managing Multiple Projects and Mediums

Donnie's business is comprised of several interconnected projects, all unified by the external thread of "promoting nervous system literacy and creating the conditions for aliveness in other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>:

*   **Nervous System Mastery Course**: A cohort-based course offered twice a year, providing cyclical space for different modes of work like writing, promotion, teaching, and reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
*   **State Shift App**: An iPhone/Android application focused on nervous system regulation, which includes [[building_applications_with_ai | AI features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Com Cards Project**: A collaborative project for a physical card deck based on nervous system down-regulation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Curious Humans Podcast**: A long-running podcast serving as "free mentorship" and a platform for interesting conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **In-person Retreats and One-on-one Coaching**: Direct client engagement activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Writing**: Contributing to publications like Every <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

## AI for Personal Productivity and Coaching

Donnie extensively utilizes AI for personal growth and coaching, treating it as an invaluable tool for [[using_ai_for_business_and_decision_making | decision-making]] and self-exploration.

### The Codex V System
Donnie has developed a template called "Codex V" (Book of Life) for [[using_ai_for_business_and_decision_making | AI coaching]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. The core idea is to provide the AI with extensive self-knowledge to generate highly relevant and personalized responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This information includes:
*   Ideal weekly calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>
*   Energetic "black holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>
*   Reactivity triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>
*   Burnout warning signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>
*   Decision-making principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>
*   Biomarkers and biometrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>
*   Prior experiment results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>
*   Core personality traits (e.g., Enneagram type) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>

Donnie uses this detailed context to ask questions, finding that the AI consistently factors this information in and provides helpful reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. He has made this template available at `buildyouraicoach.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[34:48:00]</a>.

### AI for Jhana Meditation Practice
Donnie uses a dedicated AI coaching project within ChatGPT to support his Jhana meditation practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.
*   He uploads his meditation journal and the "Journey instruction booklet" (a guide to Jhana practice) as context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.
*   The AI provides feedback on his practice, such as reminding him to relax expectations when he struggles to access Jhana states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.
*   He engages with the AI coach immediately after sessions for real-time reflection and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>.
*   He uses voice memos on his phone to interact with the AI while walking, allowing for "thinking on the move" and capturing ideas as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.

### Other Personal Uses of AI
*   **Supplementation Plans**: Donnie has found AI's recommendations for supplementation plans to be surprisingly good, comparing them favorably to those from a functional nutritionist after providing basic blood panel and organic acids test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Research**: Donnie uses AI for personal research projects, including exploring the "latch mechanism" theory for trauma storage in the body. He utilizes AI to understand the theory, research potential testing methods like blood flow mapping technology, and identify companies to contact for research units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>. He maintains a specific "Operation Latch Hunting" project for this research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>.

## AI for Research and Decision Making

Donnie leverages AI's "Deep Research" capabilities for practical life planning and complex queries.
*   **Relocation Planning**: When considering a move to Costa Rica, he used a single prompt to generate a detailed, step-by-step relocation guide covering everything from land purchase processes, financing, shipping belongings, applying for residency, and moving pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>.
*   **Armchair Philosophy**: He enjoys using AI to explore complex philosophical questions, such as the implications of AI on money or connections between Shamanism and Pokemon, receiving well-written and thought-through responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>.

## Future of AI Coaching and Multifaceted Businesses

The integration of AI into personal and professional life makes "Quantified Self" finally useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">[54:46:00]</a>. Instead of just collecting data, individuals can now use it to train models, understand correlations (e.g., how factors affect Jhana access), and receive direct feedback from AI coaches on various aspects of their lives, from personal habits to professional performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:14:00">[55:14:00]</a>.

AI coaches serve two main purposes:
1.  **Low-cost Alternative**: Providing coaching/therapy to those who might not otherwise afford it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:15:00">[56:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Augmentation for Human Coaches**: Enhancing the effectiveness of human coaches by providing continuous feedback and deeper insights into a client's week-to-week progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:28:00">[56:28:00]</a>.

Donnie envisions a future of "Centaur" teams (human plus AI) in coaching, where clients can interact with AI bots and tag their human coach into conversations for oversight and intervention. This integration, combined with advancements in voice technology and automated data input from other apps (e.g., Google, to-do lists), will further unlock the usefulness of AI in coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57:00">[57:57:00]</a>. The ability to predict personal states (e.g., likelihood of entering Jhana, or OCD symptoms) based on tracked variables is also a highly anticipated future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:29:00">[59:29:00]</a>.

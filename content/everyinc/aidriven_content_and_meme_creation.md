AI is increasingly being used to create content and memes, demonstrating its capabilities in visual design, content generation, and even assisting in the articulation of creative ideas. This development signals a shift in how creators engage audiences and develop their artistic expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Early AI-Generated Memes

One prominent example of early [[experimentation_with_aigenerated_content | AI-generated content]] is the "make it more" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This meme involves an initial prompt given to an AI, followed by repeated requests to "make it more" or "make it even later," pushing the AI to generate increasingly exaggerated or absurd images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Examples include a programmer who is "late for their deadline" made "even later," or Kelly Slater as "the best surfer in the world" becoming a "badass" surfing near the "gates of hell with water and sharks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This format is seen as one of the first true AI content format memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, showcasing art that could not have been created without AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### The "Baked Potato" Analogy

A specific instance of this "make it more" concept involved using ChatGPT to visualize a potato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. The sequence of prompts and AI responses went as follows:
*   **"Can you visualize a potato?"** - An initial image of a somewhat "pockmarked" potato was generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **"Now bake the potato."** - A baked potato image was produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **"Now bake it more."** - The potato became more circular and continued baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   Repeated requests to "bake it" eventually led to the potato turning into ash, a "cremated potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   Surprisingly, the next request resulted in a "new potato" emerging from the ash, described as a "reincarnated baby potato coming from the ash," like a phoenix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

This silly yet illustrative exercise was used to represent the evolution of ideas within the "Internet Pipes" project, moving from a raw concept to a substantial, "edible" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. It demonstrated AI's capability to generate unexpected imagery and show the evolution of a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Midjourney for Visual Content Creation

Midjourney is an important tool for [[creating_aipowered_storytelling_and_media | creating AI-powered storytelling and media]], particularly for visual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. It has proven effective in maintaining a consistent visual style for brands or projects, addressing common complaints about AI imagery's lack of repetitive style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

The "Internet Pipes" project, which helps people make sense of internet data, uses Midjourney for all its imagery, sometimes in conjunction with ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The goal was to visually represent abstract "stations" like "generation station" and "evaluation station" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The desired aesthetic was "early internet"â€”not super refined, colorful, somewhat pixelated, yet an evolution of early web pages with more colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

To achieve this specific look, the designer found inspiration by scrolling through the Midjourney homepage's curated art styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This process helps users, even those without an art or design background, to discover and understand what prompts yield specific visual results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. For example, the "Internet Pipes" imagery utilizes "blind box design" and "popular market style" as key prompts, which lend themselves to the desired energetic and quirky aesthetic when combined with "new age colors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Blind box design refers to a style often associated with collectible figurines, which are typically enclosed in sealed packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:47]</a>.

## The Evolution of Creators with AI

The advent of AI tools presents two main directions for creators:
1.  **Creating Novel Content**: Exploring what can be newly created with AI that doesn't exist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This means going beyond simply doing old tasks faster and instead discovering entirely new forms of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. The "make it more" meme is an early example of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
2.  **Valuing Human-Made Content**: Identifying what AI cannot do, particularly what people care about or value when it comes from a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

### The Enduring Value of Human Creation

Despite AI's capabilities, there's an increasing appreciation for unique, human-made content. Examples include:
*   **India Rose Crawford**: A creator with millions of followers who makes tiny sewn frogs that "live their lives on Instagram" in miniature homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This taps into the "cottage core aesthetic" or "TRD wife/husband lifestyle" but with personified knit frogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The value lies in the human effort and genuine expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Magnus Carlsen in Chess**: Even though AI can beat humans at chess, grandmasters like Magnus Carlsen "act more like artists" by intentionally playing unorthodox openings or sacrificing pieces to challenge opponents' thinking rather than relying on memorized computer lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This shifts the focus from raw calculation to personality and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Niche Content Creators**: People who are "obsessed and excited with a very specific niche topic" attract large audiences because of their genuine enthusiasm and unique expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Examples include a foraging expert who identifies edible plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, a mechanical watch repair YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, or a car reviewer specializing in older minivans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Physical Art in Unique Contexts**:
    *   **David Zinn**: Creates sidewalk chalk art that interacts with existing urban elements, making people wonder if what they're seeing is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
    *   **David Bird**: Constructs small sculptures using natural elements like acorns and sticks, which real birds then visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Rock Sculptures**: Artists who balance rocks on beaches to create intricate sculptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Calligraphy**: Creators who film the intricate process of beautiful calligraphy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Macroy**: Creates mesmerizing slow-motion videos of matches burning or other close-up phenomena, using custom rigs and ultra-slow motion cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Hot Metal Ball Dropping**: An account dedicated to dropping a superheated metal ball into various objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Typewriter Art**: Artists who use typewriters to create detailed images using text characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Live Wedding Painting**: Artists like "Watch Maggie Paint" who create paintings of weddings live at the event, with time-lapse videos showing the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This highlights the value of the "time element" and the physical "incarnation" of the art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

These examples highlight how [[the_role_of_creativity_and_curiosity_in_internet_content_creation | the role of creativity and curiosity in internet content creation]] involves "changing the rules of the game" rather than competing directly with AI's speed or precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

## AI Tools for Content Exploration and Generation

### Consensus.app

Consensus is an AI tool designed to [[ai_assisted_content_creation_and_storytelling | assist content creation and storytelling]] by rapidly fact-checking scientific claims against academic research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Unlike traditional search engines like Google Scholar, which provide a "data dump" of papers based on keywords, Consensus allows users to ask specific questions like "Does fish oil prevent depression?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. It then provides a quick pulse of "yes" or "no" from various papers, along with study snapshots and citation information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This helps users quickly gauge the scientific consensus on a topic and identify conflicting research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Another similar tool mentioned is Elicit, which allows users to chat directly with papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Globe.engineer

Globe.engineer is a search engine that aims to interpret a user's query and group results into categories based on inferred intent, rather than just returning a ranked list of links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. For example, a search for "weird quirky websites" might categorize results into "absurdus websites," "unconventional databases," or "niche interest experimental websites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. This approach can be more intuitive for discovering specific types of content compared to traditional search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

### WebSim.ai

WebSim.ai is a tool that showcases the ability of language models to "hallucinate" an entire internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Users can type in any website, whether real or imagined, and the AI will generate and render a functional webpage, complete with HTML and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Clicking on links within these generated pages leads to further hallucinated content, creating a dynamic, simulated internet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This tool highlights the creative and experimental potential of AI in [[creating_aipowered_storytelling_and_media | creating AI-powered storytelling and media]] and the ability to generate entirely new digital spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

### Granola (AI Meeting Assistant)

Granola is an AI tool that sits on a computer and records meetings, providing space for note-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. After the meeting, it uses the transcript to expand rough notes into a full summary, including action items and to-dos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Users can also ask questions about the meeting content and receive answers based on the transcript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. This exemplifies how AI can enhance productivity and information management for content creators and professionals alike.

## AI's Role in Articulation and Creativity

AI is proving to be effective at helping users articulate their own taste and creative vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. By analyzing examples of desired content (e.g., writing styles or visual aesthetics), AI can identify common threads and provide language to describe preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This is powerful for creators, enabling them to clearly articulate their goals for themselves and their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

AI also allows creators to "prove" zany or unconventional ideas before seeking traditional funding or approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. For example, a filmmaker created an AI short film of a concept "too weird for Hollywood to fund," which went viral and attracted producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This enables creators to take lower-risk bets on their ideas and develop a high-production value version later, fostering more [[potential_of_usergenerated_content_in_ai_development | user-generated content]] and interesting creative output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. The ability to "seed things for artists" is important because some artistic ideas are difficult to communicate without a tangible example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The landscape of [[engaging_and_reaching_audiences_through_aidriven_content | AI-driven content and meme creation]] is rapidly evolving. There will be an increased value for totally human-made content, as well as an emergence of new art forms and ways of creating that leverage AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The "make it more" meme is a prime example of an AI-specific content form from this generation of creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. While some AI-generated content may seem "silly" or a "rip-off" currently, it is likely to birth a new generation of artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

The trend of "verticalized" AI tools (specific tools optimized for niche tasks, rather than general-purpose models like ChatGPT) is also expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This mirrors the history of SaaS unbundling Excel, where general tools are used for specific purposes, creating opportunities for more specialized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the continued [[aidriven_iterative_learning_and_feedback | AI-driven iterative learning and feedback]] from these models can help humans learn more about their own thought processes and connections between ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. The constant surprise generated by AI's output, especially its ability to understand implicit user intent, reveals connections that humans might not explicitly recognize about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This "hallucination is a feature" mindset, where AI's imaginative outputs are embraced for creative purposes, is seen as a powerful aspect of this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

David Perell utilizes ChatGPT as a versatile tool to enhance his creative process, aiding in self-discovery, business strategy, reading, and writing. He emphasizes using ChatGPT not as a replacement for human intellect, but as a powerful partner that excels in diversity, accessibility, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

## Self-Discovery and Personal Growth

Perell uses ChatGPT to deepen his understanding of himself, which he sees as crucial for reflecting his identity in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### Understanding Core Aptitudes
Perell believes individuals are endowed with unique gifts and aptitudes, similar to how athletes like Michael Phelps or LeBron James are "made to be" in their respective sports. He extends this idea to intellectual talents, seeking to understand "what am I made to be doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. His approach involves a "surrender" to what he believes God made him to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### Integrity and Values
Integrity, for Perell, stems from clear values, principles, and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. His number one value is "the pursuit of excellence," which he observes in world-class individuals who exhibit a "graciousness to their effort" and a "compulsion" to do what they are made to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. He highlights Tyler Cowen as a model due to his deep knowledge and the "joyousness" that comes from the alignment between his career and his natural inclinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Avoiding the "Procrustes Bed"
Perell warns against adopting a "procrustes approach" to one's career, where individuals try to conform themselves to a predefined "bed" (e.g., becoming a lawyer or doctor solely due to family expectations) rather than shaping their career to their individuality. This leads to "a lot of misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of aligning with "the shape of your soul" to achieve excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

### Using ChatGPT for Self-Synthesis
To gain deeper self-understanding, Perell uses ChatGPT to analyze his heroes. He inputs a list of admired figures and the reasons he admires their personality and writing. He then prompts ChatGPT to:
*   Summarize the "vibes" of these people, expanding on their characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   Synthesize underlying overlaps and commonalities into a paragraph, four bullet points, and a single sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

This process revealed Perell's core values:
*   Passion for excellence and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>
*   Intellectual curiosity and insightfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>
*   Heart-led and joyous approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>
*   Commitment to personal and spiritual values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>

One particularly insightful discovery was the "balance of joyfulness and seriousness" in his heroes, which Perell recognized as a personal trait he hadn't articulated before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This highlights ChatGPT's ability to put words to intuitive feelings, providing "clarity and put words to things that you just had a hazy intuition around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

### Identifying Ideal Collaborators
Perell also uses ChatGPT to understand who he works best with by inputting his strengths, weaknesses, and Enneagram type (three-wing four). His core weakness is "knowing a truth and being worried about expressing that truth and saying what I need to say because I'm worried about how it's going to make me look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

He employs a "motivational interview" with ChatGPT to unpack conflicting internal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. ChatGPT is prompted to ask "one question at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, exploring his fears (e.g., being seen as vengeful or uncaring). This leads to insights about preferring "challenging communicators" over "supportive communicators" who might avoid conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

Ultimately, ChatGPT validated his preference for Enneagram Eights (direct, confident, decisive) and Fives (analytical, perceptive, innovative), who complement his own tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Business Strategy and Analysis with ChatGPT

Perell leverages ChatGPT as a strategic sparring partner, emphasizing the importance of specific prompts.

### Effective Prompting for Strategy
He notes that broad prompts like "critique this business model" yield poor results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Instead, he uses "names as compression," incorporating specific thinkers like Clayton Christensen, Michael Porter, and Ben Thompson to evoke their established frameworks (e.g., jobs to be done, disruption theory, Five Forces, aggregation theory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. This allows ChatGPT to access a "tapestry of knowledge" and facilitate a "Socratic debate" among these perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

He also employs an "expansion then contraction" method:
1.  Ask ChatGPT to elaborate on a topic (expansion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
2.  Then, ask it to summarize or provide a concise recommendation (contraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

### Case Study: The New York Times
Perell uses the New York Times as an example, analyzing its shift from advertising to subscription revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. Initial broad questions about risks yield generic "buzzword bingo" answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

By applying the specific frameworks:
*   **Clayton Christensen:** Focus on disruptive innovation, targeting smaller, nimbler competitors with cheaper, more accessible digital media products (e.g., apps, games, acquiring properties like The Athletic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
*   **Michael Porter:** Leverage brand reputation for quality, in-depth, and investigative journalism to differentiate and provide "distinct value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
*   **Ben Thompson:** The risk of digital platforms aggregating news content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

This specific approach reveals a coherent strategy for the New York Times: maintaining high-quality news on the high end of reputation and acquiring other media properties in different verticals (sports, games) at the low end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

### Evaluating ChatGPT: Slugging Percentage
Perell advises evaluating ChatGPT based on "slugging percentage" (when successful, how successful are you?) rather than "batting average" (percentage of time successful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The goal is to find the "one or two nuggets" that wouldn't have been found elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Reading and Learning with ChatGPT

ChatGPT helps Perell engage with texts more deeply and combat the "recency bias" of the modern internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Enhanced Reading Comprehension
Perell uses ChatGPT to interpret difficult passages from old books like *Moby Dick*. He takes photos of paragraphs and asks ChatGPT to explain their meaning, which helps him connect the poetic language with the underlying message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This is particularly valuable for him, as he struggled with reading comprehension as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.

### Visualizing Text with Dolly
ChatGPT, integrated with Dolly, can turn written scenes into visual prompts. Perell takes a picture of a book passage, asks ChatGPT to "turn this into a prompt that I can feed into Dolly to visualize it," creating evocative images that make the book "come alive" and enhance engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

### Combating Recency Bias and Seeking Wisdom
Perell critiques the internet's "never-ending now" and its focus on recent information, which he believes sacrifices "wisdom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. He argues for reading "old things" that have "stood the test of time" to gain wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. ChatGPT supports this by allowing users to set custom instructions to filter out recent content and by having access to public domain books and scholarly work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

### Deep Dive: The Greek Word "Archegos"
Perell demonstrates a profound use of ChatGPT by exploring the etymology of words in ancient texts, specifically the Bible. By comparing different English translations (ESV, NIV, KJV) of Acts 3:15, he identifies a discrepancy: "author" versus "Prince" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. ChatGPT reveals the original Greek word is "archegos," which encompasses "author, leader, Prince, or Pioneer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.

This insight allowed Perell to synthesize seemingly disparate ideas: Jesus as the "author of Life," becoming a "leader" and "Prince," and pioneering "a whole new way of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>. He then applies the concept of "archegos" to modern figures like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and the American Founding Fathers, showing how authorship can lead to world-changing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This deepens his argument for writing as a powerful force for impact.

Perell integrates ChatGPT into various stages of his [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | writing]] process to enhance efficiency and spark new [[leveraging_chatgpt_for_inspiration_and_creativity_in_writing | inspiration]].

### Voice-to-Text and Structuring
Perell, who prefers talking to typing, uses ChatGPT to summarize his spoken thoughts, extract main points, and structure his ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. This allows him to freely associate thoughts and then have the AI organize them into outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

### Overcoming Writer's Block
For long-noodled ideas or extensive notes, ChatGPT can generate outlines, helping to impose a basic structure (e.g., problem-solution) that might be overlooked when too immersed in the "special" nature of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

### Prompting Creativity and [[Idea generation using ChatGPT | Anecdote Generation]]
Perell notes that humans are better at responding to existing things than creating from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. ChatGPT provides this "something" to react to, turning feelings into concrete words that can be refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.

For [[idea_generation_using_chatgpt | anecdote generation]], he primes ChatGPT with specific details related to a topic (e.g., beautiful New York City buildings from a specific era). This acts as a "memory checkpoint," surfacing personal experiences linked to those details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. An example is the "Max function" anecdote, which emerged from a memory prompted by the Woolworth Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.

### "Writing from Conversation"
Perell describes his process as "writing from conversation," treating ChatGPT as an "extremely smart computer" for Socratic dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>. This dynamic allows for exploration of "new territory," similar to profound human conversations that "are food and drink for the soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:31">[01:26:31]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of "following the spark" when ChatGPT pushes thinking into new, unexpected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>.

Ultimately, ChatGPT serves as a tool for making one's thinking "legible and clear," thereby increasing the returns on intellectual investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.

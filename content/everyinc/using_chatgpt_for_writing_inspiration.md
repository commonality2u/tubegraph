[[leveraging_chatgpt_for_inspiration_and_creativity_in_writing | Using ChatGPT for creative inspiration]] involves leveraging the AI to prompt contextual memory and explore new avenues for writing [00:01:36]. This approach allows writers to surface anecdotes and develop a "world view" for their pieces [00:03:56].

## The Initial Spark: NYC and Taste

The creative process often begins with a broad idea. For one writing project, the goal was to write a piece about how living in New York City could lead to better taste [00:00:16]. To kickstart this, the following prompt was given to ChatGPT:

> "What buildings in New York are the most beautiful and distinctive? Give me a series of buildings built between 1910 and 1933" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The specific historical range was chosen to find an anecdote [00:00:50].

## Priming Contextual Memory

The strategy behind this specific prompt was to connect with how memory works. Memory is often layered and stored, similar to "behind doors" [00:01:00]. People outsource their memories to "little checkpoints" they find [00:01:05].

As an example, returning to a childhood home can trigger many forgotten memories because they are "stored in space" [00:01:19]. Similarly, "memory champions" associate ideas with spaces and then "walk through the house" to recall them [00:01:21]. The goal with ChatGPT, then, is to [[david_perells_creative_process_with_chatgpt | prime contextual memory]] to help interesting ideas surface [00:01:36].

## The Unexpected Pivot: From NYC to "Max Function"

When ChatGPT provided a list of buildings, the very first example, the Woolworth Building, immediately triggered a relevant anecdote [00:01:47].

The anecdote involved a college meeting at the Woolworth Building with a "big on Twitter" person who was intimidating to meet [00:01:57]. During this meeting, the individual shared a memorable line: "Hiring and dating is a Max function" [00:02:12].

This concept of a "Max function" means that only the best outcome matters, even if there are many less successful attempts [00:02:30]. For instance, in hiring, you might interview 99 unsuitable candidates, but it only matters if you find the one good person you need [00:02:30]. This contrasts with scenarios where many different elements need to work together, such as designing furniture for a room, which is not a Max function [00:02:22].

This anecdote, prompted by ChatGPT's suggestion, unexpectedly shifted the entire focus of the writing project [00:01:54]. Instead of an article about New York City and taste, the piece could now explore the "Max function" versus other approaches, offering a new "world view" to the reader [00:03:27].

## Embracing the Creative Process

This experience highlights a key aspect of [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | using ChatGPT for creative writing]] [00:04:14]:

*   **Flexibility:** The initial intention to write about New York City evolved into a piece about "Max function" and averages [00:04:06]. This pivot is not a mistake but a natural part of the creative process [00:04:14].
*   **Following the Spark:** When [[using_chatgpt_for_creative_writing_and_storytelling | using ChatGPT for creative writing and storytelling]], it's crucial to follow interesting threads that emerge, even if they deviate from the original topic [00:04:33]. The AI's ability to "push your brain into new areas" is a significant benefit [00:04:42].
*   **Avoiding Over-filtering:** Successful creators allow new ideas to emerge without immediately dismissing them as "not on topic" [00:04:51]. This open-mindedness allows for true [[idea_generation_using_chatgpt | idea generation using ChatGPT]] and unexpected insights.

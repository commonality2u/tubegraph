The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into corporate culture is rapidly becoming a significant trend, with CEOs increasingly issuing "AI-first" memos to their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift is not merely about adopting new tools but fundamentally transforming [[human_organizational_structure and_ai_innovation | organizational structure]] and operational philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Leadership and Vision

A key driver of this [[human_organizational_structure and_ai_innovation | cultural transformation]] is leadership from the top. Will, the CEO, CIO, and managing partner of Walleye, a nearly $10 billion AUM hedge fund, exemplifies this by leading his entire organization to pivot around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. His decision to embrace AI is driven by a strong conviction about the future of the industry and a sense of responsibility to his firm's employees and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Will's personal journey to this conviction stems from his background as an engineer with a PhD in math and a career starting with algorithmic strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. He has long considered how machines could augment or replace human jobs in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The recent surge in AI tools, which are more powerful and accessible to non-technical individuals, particularly with unstructured data, solidified his belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. He noted significant productivity improvements, even from simple writing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The pivotal moments for Walleye's accelerated [[ai_usage_in_the_corporate_sector | AI integration]] include:
*   **Internal AI Project "Current"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>: Two years prior, an analyst developed tools using GPT-3 to enhance efficiency, demonstrating AI's potential to assist with or even replace analyst tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This led to an effort to develop agents for fundamental investing that could assist with analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Realization of AI's Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>: Inspired by a podcast discussing AI's capabilities, Will recognized that while the steps to adoption might be hazy, the endpoint of widespread AI integration was clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. He uses the analogy of Merlin from *The Sword and the Stone*, who sees the future but not the intermediate steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

> "I use Chat GBT to write this email. You should be using it too and be proud of it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>...Walleye is all in on AI. Not using these tools is like refusing to use the internet in 1995 because it wasn't perfect. That's just dumb and something I can't understand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> As a hedge fund, we should be ashamed to leave money on the table by ignoring tools that make us faster, smarter, and more effective. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> Using Chat GBT is not cheating. That's a non-applicable idea from academia, where using AI to do homework or take tests is actually cheating. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> In the real world, using AI is like taking a magical elixir that makes you 20% smarter instantly or a lot more. So, why wouldn't you use it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> From the very top, we are building a culture around AI. This is not optional for anyone at Walleye. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> If you write, research, analyze, build decks, process data, or think for a living, you should be using ChattBT and/or other AI tools every single day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a> Managers, this is now part of your job. You need to be pushing this across your teams, starting with being fluent yourself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>"

## Embracing AI: A Cultural Imperative

Walleye's approach to [[ai_usage_in_the_corporate_sector | AI integration]] is defined by several key cultural elements:

*   **Mandatory Training** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>: Every person at the firm, regardless of department or technical skill, is required to achieve a base level of proficiency in AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This training is provided to make AI accessible and reduce anxiety about its [[ethical_implications_of_ai_and_job_impact | impact on jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **"Not Cheating" Mindset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>: The firm actively combats the notion that using AI for work is "cheating." Instead, it's viewed as a tool to enhance effectiveness, similar to hiring someone to handle a task so you can focus on higher-level work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Results are what matter, not the "blood, sweat, and tears" put into a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   **Efficiency for Higher-Level Tasks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>: The goal of efficiency through AI is not to reduce work hours but to free up time for strategic thinking, creativity, and managing AI "employees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Imperfection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>: Acknowledging that AI tools are not yet perfect, the culture encourages experimentation rather than dismissal. The focus is on the positive direction of travel, not current flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
*   **Leading from the Front** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>: Will emphasizes that leaders must set the tone, encouraging embrace rather than fear of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## Implementation Strategies

Walleye has implemented various strategies to embed AI into its daily operations:
*   **Quant Trading Integration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>: Quantitative trading models have long used advanced statistics and AI, with recent advancements in large language models enabling scalable sentiment analysis from unstructured data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Internal AI Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>: "Current," an internal product for fundamental long-short stock pickers, is indispensable, especially during earnings periods, for processing vast amounts of information in real-time and providing meaning beyond mere summarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Widespread LLM Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>: Employees across all departments (accounting, finance, compliance, legal) are encouraged to use ChatGPT, Bard, or other LLMs for analysis and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Data Strategy ("The Borg")** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>: The firm records almost all internal information, including Zoom meetings and calls. This data is collected into a "data lake" to be processed by LLMs for insights, memory, and predictive capabilities, particularly in risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This concept, dubbed "The Borg" (from Star Trek), aims to integrate all firm data for collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   **Communication and Incentives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>: Weekly emails with leaderboards for AI tool usage, incentives for suggesting useful AI tools, and informal weekly meetups foster a social and accessible environment for [[impact_of_ai_on_team_efficiency_and_business_operations | AI adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Personal Use by Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>: Will himself uses AI for communication, turning bullet points into high-quality memos and emails in minutes, a task that previously took hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. He also uses AI for personal journaling to capture thoughts and emotions efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

The [[impact_of_ai_on_team_efficiency_and_business_operations | impact of AI]] on Walleye's productivity is "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. While quantifying exact metrics is challenging, the high rates of adoption and internal satisfaction suggest significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The firm views itself as a leader in applying AI, particularly in finance, where the value of information edge is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

The future envisions "miniature collectives" of AI-processed data across all departments, eventually linking together to create a comprehensive, firm-wide knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. This will enable greater "operating leverage," allowing individuals and the firm to accomplish more with existing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

Historical parallels, such as the rapid changes during the Gilded Age (Civil War to WWI) with the advent of railroads and transatlantic cables, suggest that while the speed of change is unprecedented today, the phenomenon of technological disruption and skill obsolescence is not new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. The CEO believes that future companies will still need many employees, but a growing number will be machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## Addressing Employee Concerns

The cultural shift actively addresses common anxieties surrounding AI:
*   **Job Transformation, Not Elimination** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>: The message is that jobs are changing to include AI as an expectation, rather than being entirely replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Employees are empowered to learn new skills and remain competitive, similar to how Excel proficiency became essential in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Human Intellect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>: While AI handles linguistic syntax and mechanical aspects of writing, the human role in conceptual thinking and ensuring accuracy remains paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. AI should provide more time for critical thinking, not replace it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. The human element designs the "plane," while AI provides a powerful "jet engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Adaptation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>: Will emphasizes an optimistic tone, believing the world won't end due to [[how_ai_is_transforming_work_and_personal_life | job disruption]], but rather requires adaptation. He states that the choice to learn and be efficient is individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Leader's Responsibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>: Leaders have a profound responsibility to investors and employees to embrace AI and prepare their workforce for the evolving landscape, maximizing efficiency and ensuring competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

Custom GPTs, referred to as "Builders" by OpenAI, represent a significant advancement since the initial release of [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] itself, enabling a wider range of individuals to create applications and tools [02:27:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This innovation expands the definition of a "developer," making it possible for those without traditional [[chatgpts_impact_on_programming_and_data_visualization|programming]] skills to build useful tools [02:17:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>).

## Creating Custom GPTs
OpenAI's developer advocacy staff focuses on enabling developers to build using the OpenAI API and [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] [01:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>). The [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT Builder]] allows users to create [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|custom GPTs]] without needing to know how to code [03:06:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>). This functionality provides significant flexibility, enabling the creation of tools much more useful than base [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] [03:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>). Companies like Zapier offer guides to integrate their tools into [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|custom GPTs]] without writing any code, highlighting a major "unlock" in the direction of no-code development [03:22:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>).

A key aspect of [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|custom GPTs]] is the recursive nature of their creation: the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT Builder]] itself is a [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] that facilitates the building of other [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPTs]], creating a stacking effect of AI on top of AI for greater leverage [04:25:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>). When using the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT Builder]], the underlying AI feels abstracted, almost like a separate system, showcasing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models [05:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>).

### Personal and Professional Applications
[[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] and [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|custom GPTs]] are highly leveraged tools for daily engineering work, particularly in [[chatgpts_impact_on_programming_and_data_visualization|coding]] [05:51:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>). They assist with common tasks like summarizing API documentation or Stack Overflow answers into code [07:20:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>). For instance, features on OpenAI's API platform, such as feedback buttons and dynamic outage pop-ups, were built with the help of [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] [06:43:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>).

[[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding|ChatGPT]] excels at handling large codebases (e.g., 300 lines of code) within its context window, enabling more effective problem-solving than a human could achieve alone by quickly understanding and suggesting modifications [08:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>).

Examples of personal [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|custom GPTs]] include:
*   **Dream Interpretation [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]]**: Provides analysis of dreams and generates accompanying images with DALL-E [03:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>).
*   **Notion Integration [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]]**: Designed to save chat notes directly into Notion via its API [04:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>).
*   **Planty**: A [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|custom GPT]] acting as a house plant caretaker, providing advice and analysis, including through image uploads [15:56:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>). This [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] grounds its responses in specific, authoritative websites and provides a friendly, personalized feel [17:55:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>).

## Impact on Development and the Future
[[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] lowers the barrier to entry for building software products, enabling small, lean teams and individuals to achieve ambitious projects that would have been unfeasible before [11:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>). It allows for rapid project initiation and iteration, even with limited time [11:21:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>). This changes the learning process for new developers: instead of spending months on fundamentals, they can immediately build something, then learn underlying concepts as needed to fix bugs or enhance their creations [13:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:09]</a>).

This democratization of building tools, especially for [[chatgpts_impact_on_programming_and_data_visualization|programming]], is seen as a catalyst for the "next billion people to learn to code," providing personalized and empowering learning experiences that traditional education systems couldn't [13:40:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>).

Although [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|AI]] helps bridge the gap for non-coders, learning to code remains highly valuable. Developers using [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|AI]] tools can solve 10x to 20x more ambitious problems, leading to an exponential increase in individual productivity [09:29:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>). The gap between those who can code and those who cannot is expected to widen, making [[chatgpts_impact_on_programming_and_data_visualization|programming]] an even higher leverage skill in the coming years [10:32:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>).

In the "allocation economy," where [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|AI]] handles many day-to-day tasks, value shifts from what one knows (knowledge economy) to how effectively one can allocate resources and intelligence [38:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>).

## Building the "Allocator" Game GPT
The creation of a game within the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT Builder]] was proposed as an unexplored opportunity in the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] store, where text-based games ("MUDs" in the 70s and 80s) were once popular [26:48:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>). Previously, building such a game would be cost-prohibitive and complex, requiring manual image generation and intricate logic [25:56:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>). With [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPTs]], built-in DALL-E for images, web browsing for facts, and [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding|code interpreter]] for simulations make it much more feasible [26:24:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>).

The "Allocator" game concept revolves around the user playing as a US president who reallocates the government budget, with [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] simulating the outcomes [35:05:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>). The game aims to be fun and engaging, with historical facts integrated [29:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>).

### Iterative Development Process
The process of [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|building apps with ChatGPT]] involves iterative refinement:
1.  **Initial Prompt**: Define the core concept, e.g., choosing a president, reallocating a budget, and playing out historical scenarios [36:03:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>).
2.  **GPT Builder Interaction**: The [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT Builder]] helps refine instructions behind the scenes, abstracting away complex prompt engineering [36:56:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>). Giving the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT Builder]] "agency" by framing it as an "expert" in game design helps it generate more sophisticated frameworks [44:02:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:02:00">[44:02:00]</a>).
3.  **Refining Instructions**: The initial [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT Builder]] output tends to be general. To get tactical gameplay instructions (like a board game rulebook), it's more effective to copy the generated instructions into a separate, generic [[building_apps_with_chatgpt|ChatGPT]] instance and ask it to refine them with specific mechanics and a step-by-step flow [54:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08:00">[54:08:00]</a>). Requesting output in Markdown code blocks simplifies copying and pasting [01:04:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>).
4.  **Playtesting and Adjustments**: Playtesting reveals areas for improvement, such as:
    *   **Conciseness**: The [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] can be overly verbose; it needs to be more concise after the initial introduction [01:12:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>).
    *   **Specific Data**: Instructing the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] to use web browsing (e.g., Bing) to pull actual historical budget numbers adds authenticity [01:13:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>).
    *   **Structured Choices**: Providing options with concise pros and cons (like an advisor) enhances gameplay [01:14:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>).
    *   **Visuals**: Explicitly instructing the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] to use DALL-E for visual representations at each turn makes the game more immersive [01:24:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>).
    *   **Narrative Flow**: Defining a clear game flow, from presidential selection and inauguration to budget allocation and subsequent problem scenarios, ensures logical progression [01:26:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>).
    *   **Scenario Realism**: The [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] tends to be overly optimistic; explicit instructions are needed to introduce negative outcomes, variance, and randomness to make the game more challenging and realistic [01:32:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>). The inclusion of a "dice roll" or random number generator would be a good next step for this [01:38:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>).
    *   **Easter Eggs**: Incorporating specific references (e.g., Nicholas Cage cameos) requires explicit instruction to embed them appropriately within the narrative [01:28:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>).

### Gameplay Mechanics
The "Allocator" game includes:
*   **Primary Mechanics**:
    *   **Budget Allocation and Simulation**: Players allocate a budget, and the [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPT]] projects short-term and long-term outcomes, blending historical events with hypothetical scenarios [00:05:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>).
    *   **Era-Specific Challenges and Objectives**: Each presidential era introduces unique challenges and objectives, requiring players to balance budget constraints [00:12:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>).
    *   **Policy Mini-Games**: Players make critical policy decisions impacting budget allocation and national priorities, ranging from crisis responses to legislative changes [00:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>).
*   **Secondary Mechanics**:
    *   **Educational Narratives and Feedback**: Provides factual historical context [00:12:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>).
    *   **Interactive Historical Timelines**: Immerses users in the complexities of governmental budget allocation [00:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>).
    *   **Multiplayer Scenarios and Collaborative Play**: Potentially allowing multiple players to collaborate on decisions [00:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>).

## Future Outlook
The ability to build [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|custom GPTs]] democratizes access to creative tools, allowing individuals to pursue projects like games and movies that were previously impossible without significant resources or specialized skills [01:42:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>). This lowers the financial barrier, enabling creators to build cool things "basically for free" [01:42:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>). Monetization for [[developing_custom_gpts_for_programming_and_personal_use|GPTs]] is "right around the corner," offering an opportunity for builders to be rewarded for their creations and potentially leading to a "10x" increase in excitement and development activity [01:43:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:11">[01:43:11]</a>).

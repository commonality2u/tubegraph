[[spiral_v2_features_and_improvements | Spiral V2]], launched as the most powerful version of [[features_and_functionality_of_spiral_ai_tool | Spiral]] yet, includes a complete interface redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Filtering and Sorting
The redesigned interface makes it significantly easier to filter and sort content. Users can now sort by inputs, outputs, tone, or voice, which helps in quickly locating the specific [[features_and_functionality_of_spiral_ai_tool | Spiral]] needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Improved Team Collaboration
[[spiral_v2_features_and_improvements | Spiral V2]] also features improved sharing capabilities for teams, allowing for easier organization of [[features_and_functionality_of_spiral_ai_tool | Spirals]] and more effective collaboration among team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Public Library of Spirals
A Public Library has been created with over 200 handcrafted [[features_and_functionality_of_spiral_ai_tool | Spirals]], designed based on extensive knowledge of content creation. This library includes [[features_and_functionality_of_spiral_ai_tool | Spirals]] for various content types like X posts, LinkedIn posts, and YouTube descriptions, providing essential tools for creating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The underlying AI writing engine behind [[features_and_functionality_of_spiral_ai_tool | Spiral]] has also been improved with the integration of the new [[integration_with_claude_35_sonic_model | Claude 3.5 Sonic model]], leading to better outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

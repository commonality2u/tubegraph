Upon encountering ChatGPT, many individuals experienced an emotional roller coaster, feeling both excitement and dread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This reaction often stems from a perceived threat to our [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | conception of ourselves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Intellect: A Shifting Definition

Historically, the intellect has been used to define the distinction between humans and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Aristotle, 2,000 years ago, asserted that "the intellect more than anything else is man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Similarly, Anton Chekhov stated that "the intellect draws a sharp line between animals and man and suggests the divinity of the latter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This notion became even more pronounced as economies shifted from industrial labor to [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_technology_innovation | knowledge work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If self-worth is defined by what one knows, the capabilities of language models can seem threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, raising questions about what remains uniquely human if AI can write and "think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

However, large language models (LLMs) are poised to change how we perceive [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_technology_innovation | knowledge work]] and, consequently, the characteristics that make us uniquely human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This shift can transform dread into excitement and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, altering one's [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | sense of self]] for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. ChatGPT doesn't replace human roles; it redefines them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The Fuzzy Nature of Intellect

For the purpose of understanding AI's impact, "intellect" can be defined as the unique human quality absent in animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This intentionally fuzzy definition highlights what feels threatening about AIâ€”its encroachment on what is considered uniquely human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The intellect is a complex combination of brain processes, often easier to define by what it is *not* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

For millennia, humanity has defined its [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | sense of self]] by this amorphous concept of the intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When AI begins to perform tasks associated with the intellect, it creates a mix of excitement (no longer alone) and fear (threat of replacement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. To regain a firm [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | sense of self]], it becomes necessary to redefine the intellect in an AI-driven world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### A Historical Parallel: Pharmacological Dissection

Psychology contains many fuzzy concepts without clear boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, for instance, were once considered related until the advent of the drug lithium in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

In the late 1940s, Dr. J.F. Cade discovered that the urine of manic patients was toxic to guinea pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He found that manic patients had elevated uric acid levels and, in an experiment to confirm toxicity, dissolved uric acid in a lithium carbonate solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. When injected with the lithium carbonate solution, the guinea pigs became remarkably calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Cade then administered lithium to his manic patients, which resolved their mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This discovery led to what psychiatrist Peter Kramer termed a "pharmacological dissection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Lithium selectively treated manic depression (bipolar disorder) but not schizophrenia, differentiating it from other mental illnesses previously thought to have similar underlying causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Lithium acted as a "lever" and a "new lens" for understanding the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This model can be applied to technology to perform a "technological dissection" of our intellect, allowing us to redefine and clarify our concept of it while keeping our [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | sense of self]] intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## ChatGPT as a Summarizer: Redefining the Human Role

Technically, ChatGPT excels at "next token prediction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, meaning it is highly effective at reformatting and reconstituting existing knowledge in new and useful ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Cognitive scientist Alison Gopnik describes LLMs as technologies that enhance [[cultural_impact_of_technology | cultural transmission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. She views them as "powerful and efficient imitation engines," extensions of prior [[cultural_impact_of_technology | technological revolutions]] like the written word, the printing press, and the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. These technologies facilitate the efficient transfer of information, increasing human coordination and driving [[cultural_impact_of_technology | cultural evolution]] and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Crucially, language models are not currently adept at discovering *new* things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Their strength lies in bringing the entirety of existing human knowledge to bear in any given situation, formatted for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. In plain terms, ChatGPT is an exceptional summarizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This is incredibly powerful and necessary, as the sum total of human knowledge currently outstrips individual capacity to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Subtracting Summarizing from the Intellect

Recognizing ChatGPT primarily as a summarizer prompts a re-evaluation of the intellect. Many daily tasks, from writing emails and articles to coding, are forms of summarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. While this might initially cause apprehension about one's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, it frees individuals to focus on aspects of creative work that are *not* summarizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These include personal life experiences, emotional insights, and collaborative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Summarizing, while necessary, can be seen as "creative drudgery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

By allowing ChatGPT to handle summaries, the skill of summarizing can be "subtracted" from one's definition of intellect and [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | sense of identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This shift allows individuals to become the "director" or "editor" of summaries, determining their quality and directing the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This process heals the [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | sense of self]] by highlighting other valuable and uniquely human contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. ChatGPT, in this way, becomes a "lever" and a "new lens" for self-perception and creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## The Adaptability of Human Identity

Human identity is flexible and adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This adaptability is itself a unique human trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. While many jobs today primarily involve summarizing and may be dramatically altered by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, this societal challenge does not diminish the underlying [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | sense of self]] or what makes humans unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The intellect can remain intact, albeit slightly changed, in a world with language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### [[historical_parallels_in_technological_change | Historical Parallels in Technological Change]]: Culture Shapes Biology

This adaptation has happened before. In "The Weirdest People in the World," Joseph Henrich recounts the story of William Buckley, an English convict sent to an Australian penal colony in 1803 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Buckley escaped and was adopted by an Aboriginal tribe, surviving where his genetically identical friends perished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

Henrich argues that Buckley's survival demonstrates how human beings change in response to their [[cultural_impact_of_technology | culture]] and the [[cultural_impact_of_technology | technology]] they are surrounded by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Buckley and his friends, despite similar genetics to the Aboriginal tribe, came from a modern [[cultural_impact_of_technology | culture]] that provided beliefs, norms, and ideas unsuited for survival in the wilderness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The Aboriginals possessed "[[cultural_impact_of_technology | cultural technologies]]" that enabled them to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Human brains have evolved to effectively learn ideas, beliefs, values, and practices necessary for survival in any ecological niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. [[cultural_impact_of_technology | Culture]] acts as a significant accelerant for problem-solving and thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Henrich emphasizes that this learning isn't just "downloading a cultural software package" into innate hardware; instead, [[cultural_impact_of_technology | culture]] "rewires our brains and alters our biology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Our species, psychology, brains, bodies, and biology are all shaped by [[cultural_impact_of_technology | culture]], which is, to a large extent, shaped by [[cultural_impact_of_technology | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

ChatGPT is the latest in a long line of [[cultural_impact_of_technology | cultural and technological advances]] that have continually redefined what it means to be human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. It is already influencing our biology, without the need for brain-computer interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The challenge is to use this technology to enhance the richness and beauty in the world, rather than scarcity and ugliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

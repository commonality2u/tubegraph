[[ai_in_film_making | AI in film making]] extends to audio elements, with tools like 11 Labs allowing the generation of [[use_cases_for_ai_voice_technology | AI voices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. While some AI-generated voices can sound artificial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, more advanced features are available.

## Advanced AI Voice Generation Techniques

11 Labs offers a "speech to speech" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, which was utilized in the film *Borrowing Time* while it was in a beta phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This functionality enables users to act out their desired vocal delivery, influencing the generated voice's tone and emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Application in Filmmaking

In *Borrowing Time*, the "voice to voice" capability of 11 Labs was used for characters such as the judge and the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. For the film's voiceover, the creator opted to use their own natural voice, believing it sounded more authentic due to its inherent pauses and natural cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This demonstrates a mixed approach, combining AI-generated voices with natural human speech to enhance the overall audio quality and realism in [[creative_storytelling_through_ai_technologies | storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

Initial limitations exist for AI video generation tools. Runway currently allows for 4-second clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, while Pika Labs can extend up to 15 seconds, though this may lead to a loss of fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Techniques for Clip Extension

To overcome these limitations and create longer, higher-quality footage, specific post-processing techniques are employed:

### Using Topaz Labs

The tool Topaz Labs is utilized to enhance and extend AI-generated clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Key steps include:
*   **Exporting at High Resolution** Exporting clips from tools like Runway at 4K or 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Frame Rate** Changing the frame rate of a clip, for instance, converting a 24 frames per second (FPS) clip to 60 FPS or even 120 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This allows for subsequent extension of the clip duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Practical Application: "Borrowing Time"

In the sci-fi film "Borrowing Time," a high frame rate generation was used for scenes involving time travel and whipping lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The footage was then slowed down and sped up in post-production, a technique inspired by films like *Oppenheimer* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This enabled the creation of longer clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Impact on [[ai_in_filmmaking | Filmmaking]] and Storytelling

The ability to extend clips allows for greater flexibility in [[editing_techniques_in_ai_films | editing techniques]], mixing longer duration clips with quicker cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This approach makes the storytelling and [[ai_in_filmmaking | filmmaking]] more akin to traditional television content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Referencing directors like Tony Scott (known for quick cuts in films like *Man on Fire*) and Zack Snyder (*300*, *Dawn of the Dead*), the creator emphasizes that [[editing_techniques_in_ai_films | editing]] is a crucial element in [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI filmmaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This method avoids the need to solely rely on short 3-second clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, enabling the use of 8-second clips (by slowing down) or 1-second clips to create a varied cadence that aids storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Related AI Tools for Production

Beyond video extension, other [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects | AI tools]] enhance the overall production:

### 11 Labs for Voice Generation

11 Labs offers the capability to generate [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects | AI voices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While some users opt for distinct "AI-sounding" voices, the "speech to speech" feature is particularly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This feature allows a user to act out a voice, which is then transformed, as demonstrated in "Borrowing Time" for characters like the judge and the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For voiceovers, the creator preferred to use their natural voice for its natural pauses and tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

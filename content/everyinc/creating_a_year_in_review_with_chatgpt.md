Creating a year in review is a long-standing personal tradition for many, allowing for reflection and intention setting for the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. However, the process can sometimes feel unstructured or superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. ChatGPT can serve as an invaluable tool for this process, acting as an "external hard drive for our brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, overcoming the limitations of our working memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> and providing access to accumulated human knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Why Use ChatGPT for a Year in Review?

*   **Structure and Guidance:** When unsure how to best proceed with a review, ChatGPT can suggest organizational structures and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. It can serve as a primary resource when feeling confused or needing a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Deepened Insight:** It can help mine depths of insight that might be missed in solo self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **Personal Biographer:** ChatGPT can act as a "personal biographer," condensing sprawling self-reflection into crystallized summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **External Processor:** For individuals who process thoughts externally, ChatGPT provides a dialogue partner that can summarize, question, build upon ideas, and connect disparate points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** It democratizes access to functions traditionally provided by coaches or therapists, such as mirroring, summarizing, and reminding of key themes, at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

## The Process: Gina's Experience

Clinical psychologist Gina R. shares her process of leveraging ChatGPT for her 2023 year in review:

### 1. Initial Data Input and Problem Solving

Gina started by giving ChatGPT five years' worth of her past year-in-review journal entries, initially by linking a single Notion page containing all the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

*   **Encountering Limitations:** ChatGPT initially only processed the first fifth of the large document due to text limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Workaround:** Instead of abandoning the task, Gina asked ChatGPT for a solution to its limitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. ChatGPT suggested separating the journal into smaller, segmented Notion pages and providing links to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. This collaborative problem-solving approach is highly effective with ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Context:** Even with eight separate links provided, ChatGPT remembered its original task and continued the review seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

### 2. Receiving a Personal Timeline

After processing all entries, ChatGPT provided a "synthesized overview" by year, detailing significant personal and professional developments, challenges, and introspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

*   **Feeling Seen:** This timeline made Gina feel "seen" and mirrored, providing a crystallized form of her life stages that allowed for emotional processing and contextualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Recalling Insights:** The summary also reminded her of previously developed concepts, like "overcoming people mode," which she found immediately relevant again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

### 3. Asking Specific Reflective Questions

Gina then moved beyond simple summaries to push for deeper insights, asking questions she would typically ask herself:

*   **Anticipating Future Themes:** She asked, "Are there any major themes you anticipate emerging for me in the coming year given the patterns you see in my entries to date?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. ChatGPT accurately identified themes like deepening professional impact, content creation and thought leadership, and balancing personal and professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
    *   *Forecasting:* This can act as a "fortune teller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>, providing future-based projections that can become self-fulfilling prophecies, encouraging proactive realization of desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Identifying Blind Spots:** Gina asked, "What are my blind spots likely to be in the coming year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. ChatGPT identified tendencies like overcommitment, diversifying into unfamiliar areas, neglecting personal wellness, and managing expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.
*   **Guiding Goals and Priorities:** It helped prioritize goals, addressing Gina's tendency to see everything as equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. It also suggested what goals *not* to set, promoting intentional deprioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### 4. Customizing ChatGPT's Response

A crucial step in maximizing ChatGPT's utility is to guide its "personality" and focus:

*   **Challenging Defaults:** When ChatGPT repeatedly emphasized "work-life balance" and cautioned against over-ambition, which didn't align with Gina's "maximizing ambition" philosophy, she challenged it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
*   **Providing Specific Context:** She asked, "I don't actually like the phrase work life balance what insights have I in fact articulated about this in my journal and what's my distinct perspective on it if you can tell?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.
*   **Refined Output:** ChatGPT adapted, recognizing Gina's preference for an "integrated approach where work and personal life are not in competition but rather compliment and enhance each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. It then provided more relevant pitfalls like "blurring boundaries" and "over-integration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
*   **Using Custom Instructions:** Gina uses [[David Perells creative process with ChatGPT | custom instructions]] to tailor ChatGPT's responses, for instance, telling it to "talk to me like you're a busy founder who doesn't have time for like BS and just gives it to me straight" while keeping in mind her personal development goals and desire to embody the "Builder's Mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. This ensures the output aligns with her personal framework.

## Broader Implications

Using ChatGPT for a year in review goes beyond simple summarization; it contributes to [[Using ChatGPT for personal development | personal development]] and "epistemic hygiene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

*   **Self-Reflection and Growth:** It serves as an incredible mirror, reflecting insights back to the user in a way that can lead to significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Limitations:** While ChatGPT may not generate entirely new truths, its ability to systematically draw on both user input and the collective knowledge of the internet and present it coherently is profoundly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. The answers for personal growth are often simple, but finding and remembering them is hard, and ChatGPT excels at this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Fostering Integration:** It aids in integrating different compartmentalized parts of oneself, allowing individuals to become "overarching architects of ourselves in our life" by dialoguing with and understanding various internal "selves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.

This article explores the journey and strategic thinking behind scaling a [[founding_and_running_a_startup | startup]], particularly within the volatile [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI technology]] landscape, drawing insights from the co-founder and CEO of Granola.

## Granola: An AI Success Story
Granola, an [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI software]] designed for meeting transcription and note-taking, launched in May with a team of four [02:22:00]. It quickly gained traction, especially among [[founding_and_running_a_startup | Founders]] and investors, who value its ability to help them make high-leverage decisions based on meeting insights [03:16:00]. The company recently raised a $20 million funding round [02:11:00].

One of Granola's key features is its ability to record meetings in the background without joining virtual calls, transcribing them and generating automated notes [01:15:00]. A notable feature allows users to share meeting transcripts and enable others to ask questions of the recording, which is particularly useful for teams operating at scale [01:35:00].

## Product Philosophy: Intuition, Soul, and User Feedback
The core product philosophy emphasizes making [[developing_and_selling_tech_startups | product decisions]] based on one's own intuition, while also reacting to user feedback [00:05:00]. Products are seen as having "soul" when they embody a clear opinion or perspective, rather than being an empty reflection of user requests [00:13:00].

> "I basically think you can look at products and you can kind of tell whether they have soul or not... And when you're building a product you should absolutely absolutely React to what people are saying if you don't have an opinion or perspective then it it's kind of empty right it's like whatever they say you you'll just like run off after that thing whereas some products you can kind of tell if they have soul and you can also tell when they lose it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>

This "soul" is described as a "human-like element at the core" that feels coherent [02:30:00]. An example of a product with soul from 2015 was Snapchat, which had a distinct perspective and was "teenage native" with unique interaction patterns [02:17:00].

### Product Development Process
Granola's current core interaction, where notes are transformed into well-organized content at the meeting's end, was not the initial vision [10:11:00]. An earlier version involved real-time [[leveraging_ai_for_rapid_business_prototyping | AI]] invocation during meetings, which proved distracting [10:37:00]. The team iterated through several interaction paradigms, eventually cutting 50% of built features to focus on doing one thing "really well" [11:21:00]. This required discipline, especially in [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]], where it's easy to build demo versions of features [12:00:00].

Gathering user feedback is crucial for informing intuition [13:56:00]. While written feedback is a data point, "FaceTime with users" (direct conversations) is more valuable for understanding the human context [14:30:00]. It's about building an internal mental model of what feels good or bad, rather than blindly following user requests [14:20:00].

> "I think what's worked best for us and it it's harder as you scale is to have a few people you talk to a lot... Ideally you go into their office and and like Shadow them for a day which is logistically really hard to pull off but whenever we've done it it's been as super valuable." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>

### Balancing Perspective and User Input
Coming into [[developing_and_selling_tech_startups | product development]] with a perspective is more valuable than approaching users with a blank slate, as users often don't explicitly know their problems [18:31:00]. This perspective helps in "training that intuition" [19:07:00]. However, it's also critical to acknowledge when building for users unlike oneself, as personal intuition might not apply [19:26:00]. For instance, in a previous [[founding_and_running_a_startup | startup]] Socratic, building for teenagers required constant direct interaction to overcome their tendency to tell adults what they wanted to hear [19:46:00].

## Challenges and Strategies for Scaling in AI
[[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | AI startups]] face unique challenges due to the rapidly changing environment [04:48:00]:
*   **High Costs:** Running [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI products]] is currently expensive, though costs are expected to decrease in two years [04:53:00]. This creates a "Middle Passage" where companies need capital to survive until costs become more viable [05:08:00].
*   **Volatility and Unpredictability:** The future of [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_starts_up | AI technology]] is hard to predict, with things moving very quickly [05:24:00]. Raising capital can protect against this volatility [05:33:00].
*   **Pigeonholing:** Building for specific early adopter groups (like [[founding_and_running_a_startup | founders]] and VCs) can lead to being pigeonholed in a small market [07:06:00]. Diversifying the user base early is crucial to avoid this [07:31:00]. However, early adopters can evangelize the product, and some tools can become dominant over time by capturing startups and scale-ups first, similar to Notion [07:51:00].

### Startup Advantages in the AI Space
Despite the challenges, [[founding_and_running_a_startup | startups]] have distinct advantages in the [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] space:
*   **Fewer Users:** Startups can ship features using "frontier models" to a smaller user base, allowing them to figure out what works without the constraints of scaling to billions of users, which large companies cannot do [04:53:00].
*   **Risk Appetite:** Small teams can "deal like weird stuff" that larger companies cannot, as big companies have lower risk appetites when releasing software to millions of users who expect it to work reliably [43:05:00].
*   **Focus on the Future:** Startups can build products based on the premise of future [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] improvements (e.g., lower inference costs, larger context windows), trusting that costs will plummet [46:57:00]. This enables them to be "AI native" [47:27:00].

> "Don't solve problems that won't be problems 12 months from now... you got to make sure you're riding that you're riding that tsunami of technical innovation you know that wave rather than and trying to like paddle in front of it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>

### Specialization vs. Generalization
A key consideration for [[strategic_growth_and_monetization_in_ai_startups | AI startups]] is the tension between convenience/accessibility (favoring general-purpose tools like ChatGPT) and specialization (favoring tools for specific problems or professional use) [51:21:00].

*   **Generalization:** Large companies with established user habits and broad reach often win in general-purpose scenarios, even if their product isn't the "best" [51:31:00].
*   **Specialization:** There is optimism for companies building specialized tools for professionals or experts where "the experience or the output or the quality really matters" [52:09:00]. These tools, akin to Photoshop for designers, aim to make users a "10 times better version of yourself" in their domain [55:13:00].

Granola aims to move further into specialization, evolving beyond just meeting notes to help with all tasks and workflows spawned from meetings [56:36:00]. This contrasts with the "AI agent" philosophy, instead focusing on removing "busy work" (like unnecessary clicks) to take users 85% of the way there, allowing them to apply their judgment and add their personal "spin" to the final output [57:44:00].

## The CEO's Perspective: Time, Space, and Personal Balance
Maintaining the capacity for "product thinking" is crucial but challenging for a CEO, as busy schedules can eliminate the necessary "space" for deep thought [25:25:00]. Product thinking often involves understanding emotional reactions to a product â€“ "How did this make me feel?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>. This requires not only scheduled time but also emotional space, avoiding stress from an overwhelming to-do list [27:08:00].

On a personal level, the CEO finds it difficult to excel in all aspects of life (e.g., dad, partner, CEO) simultaneously, often only managing two out of three well at any given time [30:28:00]. The "trick is to rotate it" to prevent one area from suffering [30:40:00].

To maintain intuition and perspective, activities like travel and solo retreats to remote places (like Big Sur) are vital for breaking routine, gaining perspective, and feeling "small and insignificant" in the grand scheme of things [31:18:00]. This is compared to the concept of "explore" vs. "exploit" modes, where explore mode (like travel or early [[founding_and_running_a_startup | startup]] phases) is crucial for discovery, distinct from the exploit mode of routine and scaling [37:10:00]. Knowing which mode one is in, personally or as a company, is paramount, as approaching an explore task with an exploit mindset leads to poor outcomes [38:25:00].

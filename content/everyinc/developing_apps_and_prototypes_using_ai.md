[[Building applications with AI | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is fundamentally transforming the process of developing applications and prototypes, enabling faster iteration, reducing development "drudgery," and allowing non-expert coders to create sophisticated tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The shift is so profound that tasks that once took days can now be completed in hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Efficiency and Speed in Development

AI tools, particularly large language models like GPT-4, act as a "co-pilot" in development, assisting with specific microtasks and streamlining complex processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

*   **Code Generation**: AI can write entire blocks of code, especially for frameworks or languages the developer is unfamiliar with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. This drastically cuts down on the time spent searching for syntax or common patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Frameworks**: For developers new to a framework (e.g., React, Redux, Slic JS, Sagas), AI can provide a quick tutorial and explain the project's file structure and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.
*   **Troubleshooting and Debugging**: When code doesn't work as expected, AI can analyze the problem based on the developer's explanation and provide solutions or corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>.
*   **Reducing Drudgery**: AI removes much of the repetitive and frustrating aspects of coding, such as constantly Googling for solutions or figuring out how to install necessary packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>. This allows developers to focus on defining what they want to achieve rather than the mechanics of how to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>.
*   **Time Savings**: A project that might have taken two to three days in a pre-ChatGPT era could be completed in two to three hours with AI assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>. This represents an "order of magnitude" reduction in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Case Studies in AI-Assisted Development

### Athena Chat: Developing a Prompt Coach

Nathan, serving as an AI advisor at Athena (a virtual assistant company), worked on building a custom in-house chat GPT-like application called "Athena Chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>. This application was built on an open-source project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>. The goal was to add a module that would act as a "prompt coach" to help executive assistants effectively prompt the language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

Despite having general coding experience in JavaScript, Nathan was unfamiliar with the React framework that the existing app used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Steps**: Nathan provided the AI with the project's context, explaining he was lost in the React app and needed to understand its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:00">[30:18:00]</a>.
*   **Structural Understanding**: The AI explained the project's file structure, including components, Redux, Slic JS, and Sagas, providing a quick tutorial on these unfamiliar frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>.
*   **Practical Assistance**: The AI even provided the command-line instruction to print out the existing file structure, including how to install the necessary package for the `tree` command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>. This helped interpret the actual project structure and semantic file names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>.
*   **Module Integration**: When Nathan attempted to integrate his new module and it appeared in the wrong place, the AI provided instructions and code to modify the application, effectively placing the new "prompt coach" module in the desired location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[34:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. The AI also helped with refining the interface, including CSS styling and using the existing style pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: Within two to three hours, a working module was created that could intercept user prompts, run them through a meta-prompt for coaching, parse the response, and provide color-coded suggestions based on urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>. This process would have taken an order of magnitude longer (days) without AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20:00">[37:20:00]</a>.

### Weark: AI-Powered Advertising Video Creation

Nathan's company, Weark, uses an [[Building applications with AI | AI-powered application]] to create advertising videos for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:00">[47:10:00]</a>.

*   **Process**: Users input a website URL, and the system scrapes content to build a synthetic profile of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:23:00">[47:23:00]</a>.
*   **AI Integration**: A complex system leverages a language model to write video scripts and incorporates computer vision to select appropriate images from the user's library to complement the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>.
*   **User Experience**: Unlike older template-based systems, AI allows users to provide short, specific instructions (e.g., "make a video for my sale this Saturday") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:46:00">[47:46:00]</a>. The AI generates content quickly, enabling rapid iteration and selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. Users can quickly reject undesirable outputs and request new ones, embodying the "I know what I hate" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: This represents a "phase change" in ease of use and speed compared to pre-AI methods, where users often struggled with content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:28:00">[48:28:00]</a>.

### AI for Patent Application Diagrams

As part of securing a provisional patent application for Weark, Nathan used AI to generate complex diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:59:00">[46:59:00]</a>.

*   **The Challenge**: Nathan had limited knowledge of patent application requirements or how to create the necessary diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:37:00">[49:37:00]</a>.
*   **AI's Role**:
    *   **Syntax Suggestion**: After Nathan described his app's functionality in natural language, the AI suggested various diagramming syntaxes, such as Mermaid or Graphviz, and explained their pros and cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:10:00">[50:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:00">[50:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Code Generation and Iteration**: The AI generated the diagram syntax, which Nathan could then input into a separate rendering tool to visualize the diagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>. Based on the rendered output, Nathan would provide feedback ("this point should be connected to this point"), and the AI would refine the syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:18:00">[51:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Overcoming Limitations**: When the AI became confused after too many rounds of refinement due to its working memory limitations, Nathan would start a new chat, providing the best previous syntax and focusing on "localized edits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Output Quality**: The result was a comprehensive, color-coded diagram that illustrated parallel processes and dependencies within the app, providing clarity even for the internal technology team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: This method of generating diagrams using text-based syntax (like Graphviz) makes them much more maintainable and readily usable by other AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:37:00">[53:37:00]</a>. The ability to quickly generate and iterate on these diagrams saved significant time compared to drawing them freehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:24:00">[53:24:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Prototyping with AI in venture capital | AI for prototyping]] and app development emphasizes a collaborative "dance" between human and AI, where both entities mutually fill in knowledge gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>. As the human learns more about the framework, the AI learns more about the specific project details, leading to increased mutual understanding and accelerated task accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:00">[40:29:00]</a>.

This approach is particularly valuable for [[Building an AI app from scratch | rapid prototyping]] and quickly transforming ideas into functional applications, especially in areas where the developer may lack specific domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While AI tools are still evolving, future developments, such as long-term memory for AI chats, are expected to further enhance this collaborative development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. This capability to [[Leveraging AI for rapid business prototyping | prototype rapidly]] and develop applications with unprecedented speed and reduced friction is a significant advancement in the field of [[Developing AI tools for entrepreneurship | entrepreneurship and technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a>.

The advent of [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI]] is fundamentally reshaping how scientific research is conducted, from data handling to the very format of knowledge dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. As scientists gain more access to data and computational power, their work increasingly becomes computational by nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Scientific Publishing

Traditionally, scientific papers are published, but this format often limits the release of information to only what has succeeded, omitting details about failed experiments or attempted approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A significant shift is needed, moving towards making underlying data just as important as the story or conclusions presented in a paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Instead of focusing solely on the overproduction of papers, the future of science should prioritize gathering and aggregating high-quality datasets for problems of concern, allowing any scientist to build models upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. This means a greater emphasis on publishing data rather than just the conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This approach ensures that even data from experiments where hypotheses didn't bear out can be published, unbundling the model (conclusion) from the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

AI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), can help comb through vast amounts of information, potentially saving researchers countless hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. The open-source model movement is crucial for academics to build upon and utilize these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.

## [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|Augmenting Human Intelligence]]: The Cyborg Hypothesis

The core belief is that [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI]] should primarily serve to augment humans, rather than aiming for autonomous superintelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The focus is on connecting [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI]] technology to humans to make processes easier, allowing humans to focus on creative tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

For knowledge workers, [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI]] can connect consumed information in a personal way, helping recall thoughts for writing or research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The goal is to make vast amounts of accessible information useful, specifically to enable human intelligence rather than machine intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This perspective aligns with "Tools For Thought" that expand thinking and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This approach of "lowering the bar, raising the ceiling" allows for new possibilities that are not yet fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI]] Interfaces: Beyond Chatbots

While language is a powerful tool, chat interfaces may not be the most natural way to access AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The future might lean towards "agent" models that work in the background, intuiting tasks without explicit verbal commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. For example, AI can generate visual diagrams or code, which are non-textual ways to collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

However, chat interfaces are useful for creative processes where users explore multiple dimensions simultaneously or refine outputs by providing natural language feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This "teacher-student" relationship allows humans to provide judgment and creative input, which current models lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. The more a system understands human knowledge and preferences, the more it can fill in blanks and facilitate a shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

## N=1 Experiments and Predictive Science

A promising area is "N=1" (single-subject) experiments, particularly in fields like psychology or psychiatry, where traditional generalization is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. [[future_of_science_with_ai|AI]] can analyze personal data (e.g., biometric data, video journals) to predict individual states like OCD symptoms, even if a direct physiological marker is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

This approach prioritizes prediction over causal explanation, which can be life-changing for individuals facing complex conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. While LLMs aren't designed for predictive modeling, they can assist in building specialized predictive models by translating various data inputs (e.g., video to emotion embeddings, screenshots to time series data) into features for a classifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Contextual data like location, calendar, workload, and sleep can also be integrated into these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

## [[future_of_science_with_ai|Transforming Scientific Methodology]]

[[future_of_science_with_ai|AI]] is poised to fundamentally change how science is done through:
*   **Knowledge Consolidation**: AI can quickly comb through vast amounts of information and literature, which saves immense time for researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
*   **Simulation**: [[future_of_science_with_ai|AI]] models are becoming proficient at simulating data, allowing scientists to understand the "possibility space" and narrow down research questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Hypothesis Generation**: While humans currently excel at hypothesis generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>, the shift towards predictive models based on large datasets could lead to new avenues of inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Computational Scientists**: As [[future_of_science_with_ai|AI]] provides more accessible computational tools, scientists will become more computational by nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

This shift mirrors the transition in [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI]] from symbolic (rule-based) to sub-symbolic (data-driven) approaches, suggesting that applying this to the rest of science could be beneficial, especially for complex systems where causal explanations are hard to discern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.

## Unbundling Data from Narratives

In fields like machine learning, science, and journalism, the "story" (e.g., a scientific paper, a news article) and the underlying data have historically been bundled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. [[future_of_science_with_ai|AI]] now enables the unbundling of these elements, recognizing that the underlying data is as crucial as the story because it's more discoverable and legible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

Providing both the interpretation (story) and the raw data allows others to generate their own alternative stories and hypotheses more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. This facilitates deeper understanding and alternative hypothesis generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>.

## [[ai_in_personal_and_professional_settings|AI in Media and Storytelling]]

The principles of unbundling data and leveraging [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI]] also extend to media. For example, some platforms are experimenting with "extendable articles" where readers can access the raw source material (interviews, research) alongside the published article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

[[ai_in_personal_and_professional_settings|AI]] makes storytelling cheaper, not necessarily replacing traditional forms like movies, but enabling stories to be told in contexts where it was previously too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. This includes creating synthetic podcasts about internal company meetings or daily updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. This "cheapness" of production will fundamentally shift the accessibility of stories, allowing for distillation, translation, and adaptation into various formats (audio, video) for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. It can also bring back vital storytelling to underserved areas, like local news, where journalists are scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

Union Square Ventures (USV), a leading venture capital firm, has embraced artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its operations, from internal knowledge management to evaluating potential investments. Matt, a "regular" at USV, leads their AI projects, fostering a culture of [[prototyping_with_ai_in_venture_capital | tinkering]] and rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## The Role of AI at Union Square Ventures (USV)

Matt's journey into AI at USV began with following his curiosity. Initially working in talent, he would frequently share personal AI-driven creative projects, such as "fake movie trailers" made with RunwayML and scripts from ChatGPT, with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. After returning from paternity leave, he was approached by partners Andy and Rebecca, who recognized the rapid changes in technology and the need for USV to become expert users of AI internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This led to his full-time role in AI projects, driven by the excitement of being able to make [[prototyping_with_ai_in_venture_capital | prototypes with AI]] all day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

### The "Spirit of Tinkering"
The approach at USV, particularly in the context of the current [[the_changing_landscape_of_venture_capital_with_ai_advancements | AI wave]], emphasizes a "spirit of tinkering" â€“ playing around, making things, and constantly shipping new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This ethos allows for the discovery of new applications and insights, which aligns with the firm's history of encouraging experimentation and following curiosities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## Key AI Tools and Initiatives

USV is developing several AI tools to streamline internal processes, enhance decision-making, and improve communication.

### The Librarian GPT
The Librarian is a chatbot built on USV's extensive 20-year history of writing, including approximately 15,000 articles from partners and the USV blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

#### Purpose and Evolution
Initially conceived as a monolithic "super app," the project evolved into individual GPTs due to the challenges of maintaining a custom UI and the desire to leverage existing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:15]</a>. The name "Librarian" resonated because it clearly communicated the bot's function: to help navigate and synthesize information from the firm's written archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

#### Practical Application: Investment Diligence
A primary use case for the Librarian is assisting in [[Venture capital investing strategies | investment diligence]]. When considering a company, USV can input the company's "about page" into the Librarian, which then identifies and synthesizes relevant blog posts and articles from USV's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. This helps the firm demonstrate to entrepreneurs that their interest in a company aligns with long-standing theses, providing "receipts" of their sustained focus rather than just chasing "the hot thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.

#### Challenges and Human Oversight
One notable challenge observed is the AI's tendency to "hallucinate" or provide fake URLs when citing sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. Users have learned to identify these by the cursor type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of human verification. Matt emphasizes that while AI can assist in getting to a final product, relying on it to produce the final product independently often leads to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

#### Future Ambitions
The firm plans to make the Librarian publicly accessible on their website, allowing founders to dump their pitch decks and receive relevant historical USV writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. This would enable founders to align with USV's thinking even before a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>.

### AI-Powered Meeting Summaries and Podcasts
USV transcribes its topical meetings (e.g., AI, crypto, climate) and converts them into searchable GPTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.

#### Capturing and Curating Knowledge
This system allows USV members to ask questions about past discussions. A key benefit is ease of access, as all parts of the business's conversational interface are available within a single platform like ChatGPT or Claude on a phone, eliminating the need to toggle between multiple apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

#### The "Playbooks" Concept
AI is being used to capture "sticky situations" and critical conversations from meetings, transforming them into "playbooks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. These playbooks document how partners like Fred or Andy would handle specific scenarios (e.g., a CEO stepping down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:54]</a>. The goal is to avoid repeating the same discussions thousands of times, making the collective wisdom of the firm more accessible for supporting portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. This also highlights how much repetition occurs in business, which AI is adept at revealing and addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.

#### Advantages of Audio Recaps
Beyond written summaries, USV converts important meetings into "meeting podcasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. These 10-15 minute audio recaps offer a more engaging way to consume information, allowing team members to listen while doing other activities like commuting or responding to emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>. This method captures the "great stories" happening in meetings that might otherwise remain in people's heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>. This approach to [[use_of_ai_in_writing_and_investment | using AI in writing and investment]] decision-making reveals how the firm is actively [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | developing AI tools for entrepreneurship]] and [[using_ai_for_business_and_decision_making | using AI for business and decision making]].

## Philosophy: AI as an Augment, Not a Replacement

USV's overarching philosophy regarding AI is "enhance, not replace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.

### Creative Assistance and Learning
AI is seen as a powerful "creative assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. It enables individuals to bring their ideas to life and learn new skills concurrently with the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Unlike traditional learning methods (e.g., playing piano or programming), AI allows users to quickly create a desired outcome and then delve into how it works, fostering faster feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. This shift empowers a "generation or crew of people" who previously might have been deterred by the need to learn basic building blocks before seeing tangible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

### Identifying Patterns and Repetitions
AI tools reveal how much humans "repeat ourselves" in business and creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>. By recognizing recurring situations and applying contextualized solutions, AI helps streamline processes that might otherwise feel unique. For example, a CEO stepping down might seem like a unique event, but an experienced investor like Fred has likely seen it many times, allowing AI to help capture and apply that accumulated knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.

### AI's Impact on Storytelling
The "cost of storytelling" is dramatically decreasing with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. This means high-quality stories can be told about subjects previously deemed too expensive or mundane to document, such as company meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>. While writing remains USV's primary mode of communicating ideas, AI tools enhance the firm's ability to tell stories in the interim and write more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>. The value of purely AI-generated media, however, is considered to be limited to the size of a large group chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:29:00">[55:29:00]</a>.

### Data Ownership and Customization
There's a strong desire for individuals to have more "fine-grained control" over the information they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:09:00">[59:09:00]</a>. This extends to advocating for large tech companies to establish data trusts, making their vast behavioral data available to researchers for public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Additionally, the ability for individuals to export their personal data (e.g., health tracking data) is seen as crucial for leveraging AI models to gain personalized insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. This aligns with USV's decade-long thesis around composable data and web3 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.

## The Dream Machine: A Native AI Art Form

USV houses an art installation called "The Dream Machine," developed by artist Humin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. This piece of machinery locally runs a visual diffusion model connected to a Whisper API, which listens to conversations and generates real-time moving images based on what is being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

> "I think this is one of the... first truly native AI artistic art forms that could not exist in a world prior to AI." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>

The Dream Machine reflects the internal states and conversations of those interacting with it, creating a "sense of drama" and connecting viewers to the spoken word in a visceral way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. It embodies the lesson of "bring your ideas to life," demonstrating how readily available tools can be used to "just make stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. This is an example of [[using_ai_for_business incubation | using AI for business incubation]] as it was developed by a member of Bright Moments DAO, an investment of USV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

The overarching theme for USV's engagement with AI, whether for internal operations or external projects, remains a strong commitment to enhancing human capabilities and relationships, rather than replacing them. The firm is actively exploring how [[impact_of_ai_on_venture_capital_decisionmaking | AI advancements]] can fundamentally improve [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | venture capital decision-making]] and support its portfolio.

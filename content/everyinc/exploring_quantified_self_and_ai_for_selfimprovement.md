From: [[everyinc]] <br/> 

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with personal data collection, often referred to as the Quantified Self movement, is revolutionizing how individuals approach self-improvement and personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. This synergy allows for highly personalized insights and guidance, making previously abstract principles actionable and immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Quantified Self: Finally Useful

Historically, individuals interested in the Quantified Self collected data primarily out of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. This data included things like heart rate over time, habits, and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. The challenge was in remembering and applying these collected principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. With AI, this data can now be used to train models, predict outcomes, and provide contextual feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. AI tools enable individuals to leverage their self-knowledge for much more relevant and personalized responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The speaker, Johnny, frames his business around a "multimodal media company" approach, encompassing writing, courses, podcasts, videos, and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. His role has evolved from founder and coach to a "Steward of this emerging ecosystem," managing diverse projects like the Nervous System Mastery course, the State Shift app, the Com Cards project, and the Curious Humans podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. AI supports this multi-project approach by enabling him to manage many different hats effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, allowing him to be "80% good at all of the various different hats that I wear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

AI helps in areas like:
*   Curriculum design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   Marketing (improving from Grade B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>
*   Business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>
*   Business admin and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   Interview preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>

This reduces friction and allows individuals to operate as "aspiring polymaths" in business building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The unifying thread in Johnny's work is promoting nervous system literacy and creating conditions for "aliveness" in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## [[developing_personalized_ai_bots_for_coaching | Developing Personalized AI Bots for Coaching]]

Johnny has been actively [[using_ai_for_personal_coaching | Using AI for Personal Coaching]] by creating a system centered around a "Codex V" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### The Codex V: A Template for Personal Context

The "Codex V" is a comprehensive document containing extensive self-knowledge, designed to provide AI with deep context for personalized responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. This goes beyond basic information or previous chat memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. Examples of information in a Codex V include:
*   Ideal weekly calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Energetic black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Reactivity triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Burnout warning signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Decision-making principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Biomarkers and Biometrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Prior experiment results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Core personality traits (e.g., Enneagram type) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>
*   Core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>
*   Intentions and goals (personal and business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>

The AI uses this extensive context to provide highly relevant and personalized advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The effectiveness stems from the AI's ability to factor in these details when answering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>, often reminding the user of specific principles at helpful times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Custom Instructions and Communication Style

When setting up an AI coach, users can define custom instructions, communication style, and specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Johnny's template suggests a style of "direct honesty, playful reverence, and compassionate challenge," asking "potent questions" with "fewer words" for resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. This template serves as a base that can be tweaked for individual preferences, such as adding compliments or tailoring it to specific therapeutic needs like addressing people-pleasing tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

### AI for Specific Practices

#### Jhana Practice
Johnny utilizes AI as a personalized Jhana coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Jhanas are meditation states involving sustained attention to states of pleasure in the body, leading to bliss or joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Johnny regularly journals his Jhana exploration and uploads it to a ChatGPT project, along with a Jhana instruction booklet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The AI provides tailored feedback, such as reminding him to relax expectations or approach practice with humility, based on his recorded experiences and the instructional manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This allows for a more "deterministic access" to Jhanas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

#### Supplementation Plans
AI can also assist with practical health matters, such as developing personalized supplementation plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. By uploading basic blood panels and organic acids test results, the AI can provide surprisingly accurate recommendations comparable to those from a functional nutritionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## [[tinkering_and_experimentation_with_ai_tools | Tinkering and Experimentation with AI Tools]] and Research

AI, particularly with deep research capabilities, has become a powerful tool for [[using_ai_for_research_and_interview_preparation | Using AI for Research and Interview Preparation]] and general exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Project-Based AI Interactions
Johnny organizes his ChatGPT interactions into distinct "projects," each with its own set of files and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This approach helps manage conversations across various aspects of his life and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. He frequently uses voice memos while walking to record thoughts and receive immediate AI responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

### Case Study: Latch Mechanism Research
One example of AI-assisted research is Johnny's "Operation Latch Hunting" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. This involves exploring Mike Johnson's theory of "vaso computation," which suggests trauma is stored in smooth muscle tissue via "latch mechanisms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The AI helps in understanding the mechanism, its potential duration, and crucially, in identifying technologies like ultrasound devices that could map these latches and create "blood flow maps" to visualize stored trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. It even provided a list of companies to contact for further research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

### Real-world Application: Moving to Costa Rica
AI's research capabilities extend to practical life planning. When considering moving to Costa Rica, Johnny used deep research to generate a comprehensive "step-by-step relocation guide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>. This guide included details on land purchase, financing, applying for residency, import taxes, and even moving pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. Such detailed information, typically requiring extensive manual research, was compiled in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.

### Quantified Self Made Useful
The fundamental shift AI brings is making the Quantified Self actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. It transforms raw data into actionable insights, whether it's understanding how different factors affect personal states (like Jhana access) or getting feedback on daily interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. AI can provide calm, considered, and friendly feedback on personal strategies or difficult conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

### AI as a Complement to Human Coaching
AI serves a dual role in coaching:
1.  **Low-Cost Alternative:** It provides an accessible coaching option for those who might not ordinarily afford a human coach or therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.
2.  **Augmentation for Human Coaches:** AI can compliment human coaches by providing deeper insights and continuous touchpoints throughout the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. This [[exploring_human_and_ai_collaboration | Exploring Human and AI Collaboration]] creates "centaurs" – human-AI teams that are more effective than AI alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. Coaches can create AI bots for clients, allowing for continuous practice and reflection between sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

### Future Potential: [[selfimproving_ai_systems | Selfimproving AI systems]]
The future of AI for self-improvement involves:
*   **Predictive Models:** Training models to predict personal states (e.g., OCD symptoms or Jhana access likelihood) based on tracked data and personal experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.
*   **Automated Data Integration:** Seamlessly pulling in data from various sources like Google, to-do list apps, or APIs to automatically update the AI's contextual knowledge (Codex V), eliminating manual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
*   **Advanced Voice and Embodiment:** As AI voice crosses the "uncanny valley," it will unlock new modes of interaction, making AI coaches feel more natural and integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>.

This [[improving_personal_practices_with_guided_ai_assistance | Improving personal practices with guided AI assistance]] leads to a powerful self-improvement loop, allowing individuals to maintain a sense of self and pursue their creative desires by offloading cognitive burdens to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

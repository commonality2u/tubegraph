The practice of tipping, while prevalent in America, has its roots in Europe before being introduced to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:54">[01:45:54]</a>.

### European Origins and American Adoption
Tipping originated in Europe but was later abandoned there because it was perceived as overly aristocratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>. Despite its rejection in Europe, the practice was adopted in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:54">[01:46:54]</a>. The history of tipping in America is complex, with slavery being a factor involved in its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:21">[01:54:21]</a>.

### Global Variations and Current State
Tipping is not a universal practice; different countries have varying customs regarding gratuities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>. Once a country or industry adopts a specific tipping regime, whether tipping or non-tipping, it becomes challenging to alter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

For instance, Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group in New York, which includes Shake Shack and other high-end restaurants, attempted to [[alternatives_to_tipping_in_the_hospitality_industry | eliminate tipping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. They aimed to incorporate service wages directly into menu prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>. While the idea was to ensure staff made a living wage without relying on tips, the initiative faced difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:36">[02:31:36]</a>. Customers perceived the menu prices as higher, and top-performing waitstaff, who could earn significantly more through tips elsewhere, were less inclined to work in a no-tipping environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:04">[02:37:04]</a>. This illustrates the challenge of transitioning away from an established tipping system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>.

### Modern Perspectives on Tipping
There is an increasing [[controversy_and_backlash_around_tipping | backlash against tipping]], particularly with the rise of digital checkout systems in cafes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. This has sparked a [[debate_on_the_necessity_of_tipping_in_america | debate on the necessity of tipping in America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. Some argue that the expected 20% tip functions more like a hidden tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:40">[02:43:40]</a>. A common viewpoint is that staff wages should be directly included in the price of the meal, rather than relying on discretionary tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>. The ideal scenario would allow customers to reward excellent service generously (e.g., 50% tip) while reducing or withholding tips for poor service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:44">[03:09:44]</a>.

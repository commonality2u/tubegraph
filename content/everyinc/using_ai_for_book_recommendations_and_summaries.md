Alex, the creator of Alex and Books, a platform with over a million followers providing book recommendations, reviews, and reading tips, discusses various ways [[strategies_for_enhancing_reading_skills_using_ai | AI can enhance the reading experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## The Enduring Nature of Books

While concerned about the future of books in 100 years due to rapid technological advancements like Neuralink potentially allowing book downloads directly to the brain, Alex believes books will remain useful until such technology becomes widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Books have existed for thousands of years, suggesting their continued presence for centuries to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Why Books? Alex's Journey

Alex's passion for books began in college upon discovering self-improvement books, specifically *How to Win Friends and Influence People* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. He was surprised to learn that books could teach social and communication skills, expanding his understanding beyond textbooks, fiction, and poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This revelation led him to read extensively to improve his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### Physical vs. Digital Reading
Alex utilizes all three reading formats: physical books, Kindle, and audiobooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He particularly enjoys physical books for the ability to disconnect from technology, taking a pen and paper to a park or beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Studies suggest that reading physical books can lead to better retention, as readers may remember where information was located on a physical page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Using AI for Book Summaries

One of the simplest ways to use AI for reading is to get summaries of books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. If someone mentions a book you're unfamiliar with, you can use [[ai_tools_for_efficient_content_research_and_summarization | ChatGPT]] or Claude AI to quickly summarize it, enabling you to participate in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

For example, when asked to summarize "Children of Memory" by Adrian Tchaikovsky, ChatGPT provided a detailed overview of the book's themes, such as humanity's struggle for survival and interactions with uplifted species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. ChatGPT often performs better with less popular books due to its browse feature, allowing it to access information not in its initial training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. AI can summarize a book in just a few sentences or expand to several pages, offering flexibility in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Using AI for Book Recommendations

AI can serve as an "ultimate librarian" to find your next book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. By telling AI about a book you enjoyed, it can recommend similar titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

For instance, after discussing "Children of Memory," the AI recommended titles like *Blindsight*, *The Three-Body Problem*, and *Diaspora*, some of which resonated with the user's taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

A more advanced strategy is to first ask AI to describe the "vibes" or themes of a book you enjoyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. This helps articulate why you like a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. For "Children of Memory," themes included "exploration of post-human civilizations," "memory and identity," and "philosophical and ethical questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

By identifying the core aspects you appreciate, you can then ask AI for recommendations that specifically match those "vibes," serving as a "cheat code" to find similar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. The more data (favorite books) you input, the better AI becomes at understanding your preferences and making tailored suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>.

## Using AI for Problem-Solving Through Books

AI can also help solve real-world problems by recommending books tailored to specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. When faced with a complex problem, you can describe your pain point to AI and ask for book recommendations to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:03]</a>.

When the host described the challenge of aligning a growing, non-traditional media company with diverse operations (newsletter, podcast, paid subscriptions, consulting, software incubation), AI was prompted to recommend books on company culture and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

The initial recommendations included *Start With Why* and *Leaders Eat Last* by Simon Sinek, and *The Culture Code* by Daniel Coyle, focusing on traditional business alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:01]</a>.

To find more specific recommendations for "creator-run businesses" where the founder is still heavily involved in content creation while managing operations, the prompt was refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. AI was asked to identify similar companies (e.g., The Ringer by Bill Simmons, Waking Up by Sam Harris, MrBeast, Epic Gardening by Kevin Espiritu) and then look for books about their founders or similar models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

This led to suggestions like *Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter* by 50 Cent (as an early influencer-entrepreneur) and *This Is Not a T-Shirt* by Bobby Hundreds (on building a brand and community in streetwear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>. The discussion highlighted how fashion designers also operate as creative leaders of their businesses, influencing their brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:05]</a>.

## AI as a Personal Study Buddy/Tutor

AI can act as a personal English professor or tutor, helping to understand complex or philosophical books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>. When reading books with deeper levels of meaning, like *Siddhartha* by Hermann Hesse, AI can explain symbols or themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>.

For example, when asked "what does the river in Siddhartha symbolize?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>, AI explained it represents the "continuous, ever-changing nature of existence" and "experiential wisdom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>. If the explanation is too complex, you can ask AI to "use simpler words" and "be more direct," which drastically improves clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:00">[36:34:00]</a>.

> "In Siddhartha, listening to the river means understanding life by paying close attention to its flow and changes. The river represents how life constantly moves and is connected. By focusing on the river, Siddhartha learns to live in the present and see the true nature of things, finding deep peace and wisdom. The idea highlights that real understanding comes from personal experience and being in tune with life itself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>

This demonstrates AI's ability to translate between "different Englishes" â€“ academic, philosophical, or technical jargon into simpler terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>. AI can also explain relationships between characters or provide context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>.

Users can take pictures of complex passages and send them to [[using_chatgpt_for_book_recommendations | ChatGPT]] for instant explanations, effectively replacing the need for graduate school to fully comprehend dense philosophical texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>. For an ongoing reading session, one can write down questions and then use AI as a study buddy afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>.

## Using AI for Applying Book Frameworks

AI can help apply frameworks and lessons from non-fiction books to specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>. Instead of manually applying a book's framework, you can have AI do the "early work" and then add human touches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:00]</a>.

For example, when asked to summarize the "Grand Slam Offer" framework from Alex Hormozi's *100M Offers*, AI broke it down into components like value stacking, understanding pain points, offer creation (dream outcome, perceived likelihood, time delay, effort/sacrifice), pricing psychology, and scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>.

The user then prompted AI to help construct a "Grand Slam Offer" for a course on reading smarter, more productively, and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>. To ensure a collaborative process rather than AI fabricating content, the user instructed AI to "go step by step and ask me questions to help me do the work for each step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:46:00">[45:46:00]</a>.

AI walked through defining the dream outcome (maximizing value from reading, improving memory, making better decisions), enhancing perceived likelihood (using testimonials from bestselling authors), minimizing time delay (short, problem-specific lessons), and reducing effort/sacrifice (one-page PDF summaries, actionable steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. Finally, it constructed the offer, integrating additional bonuses like book lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>.

AI can even reflect on its own work, suggesting improvements for the offer, such as making the dream outcome more vivid or highlighting specific success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:55:00">[52:55:00]</a>. This iterative process helps refine marketing copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:52:00">[54:52:00]</a>.

## Using AI for Market Research

AI can analyze large datasets, such as survey responses, to identify common problems or interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. When creating a course on reading, Alex collected over 500 responses on people's biggest reading obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

By feeding this data to AI, it could summarize the top 10 most common problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>. The identified pain points included:
1.  Time management and scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>
2.  Retention and recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>
3.  Note-taking and annotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>
4.  Focus and concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>
5.  Motivation and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>
6.  Comprehension and application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>
7.  Reading speed and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>
8.  Book selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>
9.  Balancing different types of reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>
10. Procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>

Time management was identified as the most common issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

## Overcoming Reading Obstacles

For time management in reading, Alex suggests focusing on combination (listening to audiobooks during commutes or workouts) or prioritization (reading for 5-10 minutes before Netflix or bed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

Many people believe they aren't readers but simply haven't found the right book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. The joy of reading, often present in childhood with picture books or fantasy series, can be stifled by being forced to read "boring" classics in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>. The "unlock" for many is realizing they are free to read anything they want after school, often stumbling upon self-improvement books like *Atomic Habits* or *How to Win Friends and Influence People* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

Alex advises picking up shorter books to build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>. He caps his active reads at three books: a serious learning book, a fun book, and an audiobook for on-the-go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>.

> "Buying books and reading books are two different hobbies." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>

Every time you buy a book, you're investing 5 to 10 hours of your time to read it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. Therefore, it's beneficial to prioritize reading books relevant to current life priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>.

AI's ability to summarize books quickly can also act as a "sample" to determine if a book contains the desired lessons before committing to reading it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. This allows for efficient discovery and consumption of ideas in formats suitable for different attention spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

Overall, AI serves as a powerful tool for personalizing the reading experience, making it more accessible, efficient, and tailored to individual needs and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

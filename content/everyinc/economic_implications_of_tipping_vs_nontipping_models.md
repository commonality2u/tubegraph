The practice of tipping in America has become a point of contention, leading to a [[controversy_and_backlash_around_tipping | backlash against tipping]] due to perceived changes in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This has prompted a [[debate_on_the_necessity_of_tipping_in_America | debate on the necessity of tipping in America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Current Challenges with Tipping

Customers often find themselves quibbling over appropriate tip amounts, especially when service is not satisfactory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems like Stripe or Square displaying tip prompts at cafes further highlights this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Many view the common expectation of tipping around 20% as a de facto tax on the meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. If tipping is essentially a fixed charge, some argue it should be explicitly incorporated into the meal price and branded as such, rather than being a societal expectation that rewards or punishes service quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Ideally, customers would prefer to reward excellent service with significant tips (e.g., 50%) and provide minimal or no tip for poor service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## [[History and origin of tipping practices | Historical Context of Tipping]]

The [[history_and_origin_of_tipping_practices | origin of tipping]] can be traced back to Europe before being introduced to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Interestingly, European countries later largely abandoned tipping, considering it too aristocratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The practice in America is further complicated by historical ties to slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Tipping is not a universal phenomenon; different countries have varying approaches to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## [[Alternatives to tipping in the hospitality industry | Alternatives to Tipping]]

One significant alternative involves eliminating tipping altogether and increasing menu prices to cover a living wage for staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Case Study: Union Square Hospitality Group

Danny Meyer, who runs Union Square Hospitality Group (owner of Shake Shack and other fine restaurants), attempted to eliminate tipping in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Economic Implications of Transitioning

Transitioning from a tipping model to a non-tipping model presents significant economic challenges:

*   **Customer Perception**: When a restaurant is the only one to eliminate tipping, its menu prices appear more expensive to customers, potentially deterring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Staff Retention**: While a non-tipping model might offer a better base wage, some waitstaff, particularly top performers, can earn significantly more through tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This can lead to the best employees seeking higher-earning opportunities elsewhere, making it difficult for non-tipping establishments to attract and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

It is very difficult to change an established tipping "regime" once it is in place; it's hard to get rid of tipping where it exists, and hard to introduce it where it doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

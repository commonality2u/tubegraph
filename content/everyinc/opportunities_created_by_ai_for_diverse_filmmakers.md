While there has been significant [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_filmmaking | backlash]] within the traditional filmmaking community concerning [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI tools]], particularly regarding changes to who makes films, what films are made, and compensation, some view [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] as a transformative force for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For many, embracing [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] stems from necessity and the recognition of new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Democratizing Filmmaking Access

For people of color and other underrepresented groups, [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] presents a crucial "lane" in an industry where diversity is still limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While brilliant Black and female filmmakers are achieving recognition, their numbers remain small, especially in genres like sci-fi and horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The mere fact that Jordan Peele is often the sole reference for a Black horror director highlights this scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Filmmakers and writers, including those with "big-time" industry connections, are beginning to acknowledge the positive potential of [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It offers a significant opportunity to enhance creative processes and provide opportunities to storytellers who might not otherwise have them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This includes anyone from a "white kid from Arkansas" to a "black kid from the hood," giving everyone a chance to create something incredible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Ultimately, [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] is seen as the best chance for aspiring creators, filmmakers, and artists to produce work that can achieve large-scale visibility using [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Lowering Barriers to Entry

A significant benefit of [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] is its capacity to drastically reduce the cost and skill level required to begin making films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Just as [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] expands the pool of individuals capable of creating software, it similarly democratizes filmmaking by making it more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The barrier to entry for creating even a small video clip has been tremendously lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

```ad-note
"The cost and and the level of skill maybe to get started with building just a making a a very very small video clip just went down tremendously." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
```

The speaker reflects on their childhood desire to make movies, which was often hindered by the limitations of available tools and the high skill demands of technologies like 3D animation in the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Had the current [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI filmmaking tools]] been available then, they believe they would have pursued filmmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Now, anyone can embark on making a movie without requiring significant financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This directly supports the [[role_of_ai_in_lowbudget_filmmaking | role of AI in low-budget filmmaking]].

## Addressing Concerns and the Future

Discussions with industry bodies, such as the board of directors at SAG (Screen Actors Guild), have shed light on the distinction between CGI and [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While concerns about [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] replacing actors exist, it's understood that [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] will likely be utilized similarly to CGI for creating large crowd scenes and digital doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Crucially, such applications are expected to operate with consent and proper compensation for likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This highlights a focus on responsible [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] integration, forming part of the broader [[intersection_of_traditional_and_ai_filmmaking | intersection of traditional and AI filmmaking]].

Ultimately, the argument is that [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI]] represents a unique opportunity for aspiring creators and filmmakers to bring their visions to a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This perspective underscores the potential for [[ai_as_a_tool_for_democratizing_film_production | AI to democratize film production]] and foster diverse voices in the industry.

The process of analyzing personal sensibility, interests, and even personality through an individual's collected notes and quotes has been a long-standing fascination for authors and researchers. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and advanced software, this concept is moving from theoretical to practical application, as demonstrated by author and TV creator Stephen Johnson and Google's NotebookLM project.

## The Obsession with Organizing Ideas
Stephen Johnson has long been dedicated to organizing his thoughts and research materials to facilitate his writing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This "obsession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> dates back to 1987 when Apple released HyperCard, a hypertext system that allowed users to organize information and create links between ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Though HyperCard didn't achieve mainstream success, it influenced many and gave Johnson "a sense of the possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> for software-assisted organization.

Around 20 years ago, Johnson adopted DevonThink, a program that allowed him to store quotes from books, make connections between them, and perform associative searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. He experienced moments where the software would recommend forgotten quotes, sparking new connections in his mind, which he described as a "partnership" with the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This collaborative approach, where his intelligence curated quotes and the software made connections, felt powerful and tantalizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

With the emergence of language models like GPT-3, Johnson realized the full potential for this kind of advanced organizational and analytical software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. His personal philosophy for organizing information, which he calls "emergent chaos," involves dumping everything into one place and relying on "smart tools like search and and now all these language models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> to find what's needed, rather than spending time manually tagging or categorizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## NotebookLM: A New Paradigm for Research and Writing
NotebookLM, developed by Google Labs with Johnson as editorial director, is designed to be an ideal research and writing software with a language model at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The product aims to create a "genuinely new kind of surface to work with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, moving beyond simply adding AI to existing applications.

Key features of NotebookLM include:
*   **Grounded in User Data**: All functions are based on documents ("sources") provided by the user, ensuring that information used is under their control and not used to train the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Integrated Interface**: It allows users to load, navigate, and read various documents (Google Docs, PDFs, text files, Google Slides with image understanding) within a single environment, preventing the need for multiple open tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Inline Citations**: Responses from the model include citations that link directly back to the original source passage, allowing for easy verification and deeper exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   **Source Guides and Templates**: NotebookLM can generate summaries across all sources (Notebook Guide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>, FAQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>, timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, and even a cast of characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>, providing high-level overviews of extensive material.
*   **Note-Taking and Curation**: Users can save interesting responses or quotes to a "noteboard" area, building a curated collection of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

## The Sensibility Experiment: Can AI Understand Personal Interests?
During a live demonstration, the host challenged NotebookLM to analyze Johnson's personal sensibility based on his vast collection of 7,000 saved quotes, dating back to 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This collection represents Johnson's reading history and significant interests captured over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

When asked to "describe what you would say my interest and sensibility and general sensibility and Sensibility um um what what do I care about most these quotes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, NotebookLM responded cautiously:
> "It is difficult to draw concrete conclusions about your interest and Sensibility solely from the provided Source material however the content suggests an interest in a diverse range of topics including literature you includeed reading notes from novels like authors just like Jonathan Franzen history and politics philosophy and economics lots of lots of citations psychology and cognitive science." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>

The model, by design, is "fully grounded" in the provided sources and "sticks to the facts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Since the quotes themselves don't contain "any psychological explanation of who Stephen Johnson is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, the model refrains from speculating on his personality. This highlights a current limitation for deep personal analysis, though Johnson suggested that a "slider of sorts" could be implemented to allow for different levels of "openness and closeness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a> in the model's responses.

## Uncovering Conceptual Connections and Disagreements
Despite the model's cautious approach to personal sensibility, it proved highly effective at uncovering conceptual connections and even specific disagreements within the vast dataset. When asked to find "authors who most disagree with each other whose position disagree with each other whose position i s are the most opposed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>, NotebookLM identified a philosophical disagreement between Johann Most and Emma Goldman over the use of violence, culminating in a physical attack mentioned in Johnson's notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. This was described as "a pretty astonishing answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>, demonstrating the model's ability to extract specific, complex interactions.

A follow-up question asked which other author in the sources "would have been most helpful in kind of resolving their dispute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. NotebookLM correctly suggested Peter Kropotkin, an anarchist philosopher who inspired Goldman and held a "Middle Ground position on the use of violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Johnson confirmed this was "exactly the right answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## Implications for Future Research and Creativity
This demonstration of NotebookLM's capabilities showcases its potential for enhancing research, writing, and creative endeavors. The ability to quickly synthesize vast amounts of disorganized information, identify key themes, historical timelines, and even conceptual disagreements, can significantly accelerate the initial stages of a project.

Johnson's vision extends to AI models eventually understanding a user's general sensibility well enough to proactively suggest relevant information or even scour the internet for useful insights, entering an "agent mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This future could involve a more profound "fusion of like so many different um separate intelligences coming together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>â€”original authors, human curators, and the synthesizing power of AI models like Gemini Pro and NotebookLM. This collaborative model transforms the creative process from a "duet" to a "full chorus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>, enhancing [[exploration_of_ai_utilization_in_personal_and_professional_growth | AI utilization in personal and professional growth]].

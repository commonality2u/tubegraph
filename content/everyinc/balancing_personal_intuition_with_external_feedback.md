Developing a product requires a delicate balance between a creator's personal intuition and external feedback from users. This approach, often referred to as [[developing_ai_products_with_user_feedback | developing AI products with user feedback]], is crucial for building products that possess "soul" and genuinely resonate with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Role of Intuition and Perspective

Product decisions should primarily be based on one's own intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. While intuition can be "a hard thing," with some being "bad" and others "good," it's about discerning what genuinely "feels right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Products, much like art, can be assessed for whether they possess "soul" â€“ a unique, coherent human element at their core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

Without a strong personal opinion or perspective, a product risks becoming "empty," merely running after whatever users suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This internal anchoring truth is essential, especially when building for oneself, as it defines what the creator cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Informing Intuition with User Feedback

While personal vision is key, it's "unfathomably hard to put yourself in another person's shoes" in an abstract way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Therefore, intuition must be informed by as much relevant user context as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The approach isn't about blindly following user suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, but rather using their input to build and evolve an internal mental model of what feels good or bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

Effective methods for gathering user feedback include:
*   **Direct Interaction:** "FaceTime with users" is highly valuable, as written feedback is merely a data point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Seeing users in their full context makes it easier to understand their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Consistent Engagement:** Regularly speaking with a small group of users through chat and periodic calls helps build trust and honesty, especially with demographics that might be reluctant to provide direct criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Shadowing:** Observing users in their natural environment, such as shadowing them in their office, provides invaluable insights into their actual interactions with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **User Tests:** Putting features in front of users quickly reveals whether underlying assumptions are correct or "completely wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. The key is to pay attention to how the product makes people *feel* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

## Avoiding Pitfalls and Maintaining Space

A common pitfall is to approach user feedback without a strong perspective. This can lead to "blankness" in responses, as users themselves often don't explicitly know their problems or desired solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. A specific product or perspective can elicit more valuable feedback and help train intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. This highlights the [[interconnection_of_science_and_intuition | interconnection of science and intuition]] in product development.

Maintaining the space for "product thinking" is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Being overly busy, with schedules packed with meetings, can eliminate time for creative and intuitive thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. It's not just about calendar time but also about having "emotional time or emotional space" to truly reflect and figure out how one feels about something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. This requires discipline, especially in fast-paced environments like startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

This dual approach of deeply understanding user needs while maintaining a strong internal perspective is essential for creating products that not only work well but also possess that intangible "soul" that captures users. The ability to reflect, like in [[epistemic_hygiene and selfreflection | epistemic hygiene and self-reflection]] practices such as personal retreats or fasts, can help cultivate this intuitive space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.

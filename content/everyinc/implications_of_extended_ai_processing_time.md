The introduction of OpenAI's 01 model marks a significant shift in how artificial intelligence processes and delivers information, particularly through its ability to engage in extended "thinking" time during inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:37">[02:32:37]</a>. This new paradigm, where performance scales with the amount of time a model spends thinking, carries various implications for users and businesses alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:43">[02:24:43]</a>.

## Chain of Thought Reasoning

The core mechanism behind 01's enhanced performance is "Chain of Thought" reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. This approach has been observed to improve AI accuracy and reduce hallucinations by prompting models to articulate their thought process step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. Unlike previous GPT models that might intuitively "blurt out" answers, 01 is trained by reinforcement learning to natively perform Chain of Thought reasoning for every query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. This means users can observe a summary of its thought process, such as presenting a proof, observing even numbers, and revisiting ancient beliefs when answering complex questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## A New Paradigm for AI Performance

Traditionally, improving AI models involved adding more data or increasing compute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:41">[02:11:41]</a>. However, 01 demonstrates that scaling the time the model uses to think directly scales its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:43">[02:24:43]</a>. This represents a completely new way to enhance AI capabilities by allowing the AI to spend more time considering a prompt before responding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:34">[02:31:34]</a>.

## Implications for Users

The ability of AI models to take extended processing time has several [[potential_future_developments_and_implications_of_ai_technologies | implications for users]]:

*   **Tackling Complex Problems**
    In the future, models like 01 may be able to address significantly more difficult problems than current AI can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>. Users might instruct AI to spend hours or even days on a challenging question before returning with a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>.

*   **The Allocation Economy and New Human Skills**
    This shift suggests a move from a "knowledge economy" to an "allocation economy," where human compensation is based on the ability to [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence | allocate intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Learning how to effectively prompt and manage models like 01, which can be expensive and long-running, will become a crucial skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a>. This involves understanding when to use such an advanced model and how to formulate prompts for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:47">[03:20:47]</a>. The time and cost associated with 01's extended processing necessitate careful consideration of which "bets to take" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This also points to potential [[impact_of_ai_on_human_intellect | impact of AI on human intellect]] and a different form of [[impact_of_ai_on_learning | learning]].

*   **Prompting Strategies**
    Prompting 01 differs from general ChatGPT models. It performs better with shorter, more concise prompts that focus directly on the essential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:03">[03:43:03]</a>. Unlike other models where extensive context can be provided without significant performance degradation, 01 requires users to be selective with information to ensure its Chain of Thought remains focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:08">[03:53:08]</a>.

## Implications for Businesses

Businesses stand to gain significantly from models capable of extended AI processing time, particularly for handling complex queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:23">[04:15:23]</a>.

*   **Handling Complex Queries**
    Companies are more likely to encounter complicated queries that necessitate the deep reasoning capabilities of a long-running model like 01 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:01">[04:20:01]</a>.

*   **Real-world Impact**
    Initial testing has shown tangible benefits; for example, an internal incubation project at Every experienced a 20% improvement simply by integrating 01 into some simple use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:04">[04:26:04]</a>.

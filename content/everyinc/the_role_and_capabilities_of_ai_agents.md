AI agents are becoming increasingly prevalent and are fundamentally changing how users interact with technology and how work, particularly software development, is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. These agents are designed to take action on behalf of users, utilizing tools, making changes in systems, and consulting diverse information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Core Capabilities and the Agentic Web
For agents to be truly effective, they require an ecosystem similar to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This concept, dubbed the "agentic web," envisions a world where agents can seamlessly communicate with websites and APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Key components for this include:
*   **Standard Protocols**: Simple, composable, and layering protocols like MCP (for agent communication, similar to HTTP) and NL web (for agent interaction, similar to HTML) are crucial for enabling agents to "do stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Microsoft is actively pushing for internal systems to speak a standard protocol to all agents being developed within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Access to Information and Tools**: Agents need robust access to internet resources, computer data, and various tools to function powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
*   **Improved Memory**: Current agents can be transactional, with memory often constrained and coherent only for the duration of a single task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Enhancing agentic memory is essential to allow for delegation of increasingly complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Evolution of AI and the "Capability Overhang"
Over the past year, the reasoning capabilities of AI models have advanced, sometimes outpacing their practical application in products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This "capability overhang" highlights a collective industry challenge to bridge the gap between what models are capable of and what is delivered to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The focus has shifted from merely demonstrating scaling laws to addressing the broader infrastructure needed for agents to be truly useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Security Considerations for the Agentic Web
As the [[development_of_autonomous_agents | development of autonomous agents]] progresses and they gain more access, security becomes a critical concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Key aspects for a secure agentic web include:
*   **Agent Identities**: Agents need identities to build entitlement systems, allowing them to act on behalf of a person and be entitled to specific resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Permission Requests**: Agents should be able to query systems to understand what entitlements are needed for a task and request permission from the user or system administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   **AI-Enhanced Security**: Future security models might involve personal agents monitoring communication modalities, noticing unusual activity, and triangulating whether it's legitimate or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. This suggests that robust security can coexist with open, permissionless innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

## Impact on Craftsmanship and Professional Roles
The [[role of AI in programming assistance | role of AI in programming assistance]] and other fields is transforming professional work. While some express concern that using agents for coding might diminish the "craft" feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, it's acknowledged that passionate makers, whether software engineers, woodworkers, or potters, will always have strong opinions about their craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. The nature of software development has changed non-trivially many times over the past four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

Users and professionals will continue to have choices regarding their tools and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. The key advice for navigating these changes is to maintain an open mind and be curious about new tools, using what works and discarding what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. The diversity of agents will likely be driven by developers' understanding of specific problems, leading to a wide array of specialized tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.

## The Future of AI Agents and User Interaction
The [[the_future_of_ai_agents_and_user_interaction | future of AI agents]] will likely see a continued increase in their capabilities and widespread adoption. Key predictions include:
*   **Ubiquitous and Diverse Agents**: There will be many different agents, rather than one "agent to rule them all," allowing developers and users choice in their tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Interaction**: Future interactions with agents will shift from synchronous prompting to asynchronous delegation, where agents can tackle complex problems over extended periods, making multiple calls to systems and integrating responses before returning an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. This will allow for a higher level of ambition in the problems agents can solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.
*   **Continued Progress**: The technology will continue to become cheaper and more capable every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>. Waiting to engage with this technology due to perceived limitations will lead to falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>.

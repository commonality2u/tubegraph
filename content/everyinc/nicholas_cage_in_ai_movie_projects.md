This article explores the use of [[AI in filmmaking]] tools to animate still images, specifically focusing on a striking image of actor Nicholas Cage. The process highlights how [[AI in film production]] can be used to create dynamic cinematic elements from static visuals.

## Animating Images with Runway

Runway is a versatile [[AI in filmmaking]] tool that integrates text-to-image-to-video capabilities within a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is particularly valued for its ability to animate "cinematic images" by offering a high level of control over motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Nicholas Cage Image

The specific image used for demonstration features Nicholas Cage "surrounded by the spirits" and "looking at the Book of the Dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This image was deemed ideal for applying motion effects due to its inherent elements like smoke and light rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Using the Motion Brush Tool

The Motion Brush is a feature within Runway that allows users to precisely control animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Users can select a brush tool to "color over areas" of the image they wish to animate, and then define the type and intensity of movement for those selected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Application of Motion Brush to the Nicholas Cage Image

Multiple "brushes" were applied to different elements of the Nicholas Cage image to create varied movements:

*   **Nicholas Cage:** A subtle "ambient movement" was applied, suggesting slight shifts like hair rustling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Spirits/Ghosts:** A "vertical brush" was used to make the ethereal "smoke" appear to rise into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Light from God:** "Ambient noise" and "proximity" settings were adjusted to create the effect of light rays subtly moving "towards us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Candles:** A small amount of "ambient noise" was added to simulate flickering candlelight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The process often involves "trial and error" to achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Users can also incorporate camera movements, such as a "zoom out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, to further enhance the animation.

### Generating and Refining Clips

After applying the motion settings, the tool generates animated clips. It is common practice to generate multiple versions (e.g., five at a time) because the exact outcome can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Generation typically takes about a minute per image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Different generations of the same image can have subtle variations in character movement, such as Nicholas Cage leaning in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> or a "head tilt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Some generations might even subtly alter the character's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Editors can further refine these animated clips by taking "multiple Generations into like a Premiere" (referring to video editing software) and layering them. This allows combining the best parts from different clips, for example, using the smoke animation from one clip and the character animation from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This post-processing enables precise masking and compositing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

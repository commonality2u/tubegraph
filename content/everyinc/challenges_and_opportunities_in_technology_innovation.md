## The Rise of Agents and the Agentic Web

The technology landscape is undergoing significant transformation with the emergence of AI agents. A key theme in recent discussions points to the increasing ubiquity of agents, which was a prediction that largely materialized [01:51:00]. This year's focus has shifted from scaling laws to the "agentic web" [02:13:00].

### Challenges for Agent Utility

Despite advances in AI models, there's a "capability overhang," where the models' reasoning capabilities have outpaced their application in products [02:51:00]. This gap requires collective industry effort to close [03:08:00]. To become truly useful, agents need to overcome several [[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | challenges]]:

*   **Memory Constraints** Agents often operate transactionally, meaning their memory is coherent only for a single task and may not persist, hindering their ability to handle complex, delegated tasks [04:02:00].
*   **Action and Tool Use** Agents must be able to take actions on behalf of users, utilize various tools, modify systems, and consult diverse and rich information sources [00:39:00], [03:42:00].
*   **Ecosystem Development** A robust ecosystem, similar to the internet, is necessary for agents to function effectively. This requires standardized protocols for agents to interact with existing information sources, websites, and APIs [00:54:00], [04:50:00]. Microsoft, for instance, is pushing for internal systems to speak a standard protocol to all agents they write [01:15:00], [07:07:00].

### Opportunities in the Agentic Web

The development of the agentic web presents significant opportunities:

*   **Open Protocols** Simple, composable, and open protocols, like MCP (analogous to HTTP for the internet) and NL web (similar to HTML), are emerging to facilitate communication and integration within the agentic web [05:36:00]. These protocols aim to solve important problems for agent makers, platform infrastructure builders, users, and providers, aligning incentives for participation [08:36:00], [09:05:00].
*   **Permissionless Innovation** An open model for AI fosters [[types_of_innovation | permissionless innovation]], allowing individuals to build and distribute things without needing approval from gatekeepers or central authorities [13:05:00]. This directly connects creators with those who benefit from their work [13:43:00].
*   **Enhanced Security** While open models may seem to complicate security compared to verticalized models (like the App Store), there's potential for robust security using AI itself [14:03:00]. Agents could be designed to manage personal security requirements, assess risks, and triangulate suspicious activity across communication channels [14:25:00]. Key security components include agent identities, entitlement systems, and mechanisms for agents to request user permission for actions [10:44:00].

## The Evolution of Software Engineering and Craft

The nature of software engineering is continually changing [00:31:00], [17:26:00]. While some express concern that agents might diminish the "craft" feeling of coding [00:04:00], [16:07:00], this perspective has been observed throughout technological shifts.

### Adapting to Change

*   **Strong Opinions, Open Mind** Makers, whether software engineers, woodworkers, or potters, often have strong opinions about their craft, tools, and materials, which is essential for excellence [00:20:00], [16:51:00]. However, it's crucial to have an open mind as tools evolve [20:08:00].
*   **Choice and Outcome-Orientation** Developers will continue to have choices in their tools and approaches [17:46:00]. Some may prioritize the process, while others prioritize the outcome, leading to diverse tool adoption [19:33:00].
*   **Learning New Technologies** Historically, new technologies, like power tools in woodworking or 3D printers, have been met with skepticism but ultimately become indispensable for their utility [18:54:00], [20:27:00]. Curiosity and willingness to try new things are vital for staying relevant [01:27:00], [20:46:00].

### Future of Software Engineering Agents

The future of software engineering agents is likely to involve a diverse ecosystem rather than a single dominant agent [21:03:00]. Developers will continue to have the freedom to choose and experiment with different tools [21:34:00].

The primary dimension for differentiation among agents will be their product-making capability â€“ how well they understand and solve user problems [22:07:00]. This means innovation will be driven by a nuanced understanding of problems, rather than solely by differentiated infrastructure [22:29:00]. This trend is leading to a surge in new software development tools, all vying to address specific user needs [23:19:00].

## Predictions for the Future of Technology

Looking ahead, several trends are likely to shape the technological landscape:

*   **Accelerated Progress** The cost of technology will decrease, and capabilities will continue to improve year after year [24:43:00]. Those who delay engaging with new technologies, using cost or capability as excuses, risk falling significantly behind [24:33:00], [24:36:00].
*   **Increased Ambition** The level of ambition in problems tackled by agents will grow [25:40:00].
*   **Shift to Asynchronous Interaction** As the agentic web becomes more complete and models improve in reasoning and planning, interactions with agents will transition from synchronous (immediate back-and-forth) to asynchronous [25:46:00]. Users will delegate complex, time-consuming tasks to agents, which will perform multiple actions and integrations over time before reporting back [26:02:00].

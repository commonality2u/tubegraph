There has been an observed backlash against tipping, particularly with the increase in tipping prompts at cafes using systems like Stripe or Square checkout [00:00:27]. This sentiment often stems from frustrations with changing tipping practices, leading to questions about the necessity and structure of tipping [00:00:39].

## Utilizing AI to Understand the Debate

To gain a broader perspective on the [[debate_on_the_necessity_of_tipping_in_america | debate on the necessity of tipping in America]], artificial intelligence (AI) was employed [00:00:50]. ChatGPT was prompted to provide a debate between two individuals on whether tipping should exist in America [00:00:54]. The AI structured this debate with a moderator and two opposing viewpoints, presented in clear bullet points [00:01:04]. This approach was found helpful in understanding both sides of the argument and is applicable to various other controversial topics [00:01:16].

## The History and Nature of Tipping

Through further research, insights into the [[history_and_origin_of_tipping_practices | history and origin of tipping practices]] have emerged [00:01:41]:
*   Tipping originated in Europe before being brought to America [00:01:46].
*   Europeans eventually abandoned tipping, viewing it as too aristocratic [00:01:50].
*   The practice in America has historical connections to slavery [00:01:54].
*   Tipping is not a universal practice; different countries have varying customs [00:01:59].

## Challenges with the Current Tipping System

The current tipping system in America faces several criticisms:
*   **Perceived as a Tax** Tipping often feels like a mandatory tax, particularly with the expectation of tipping around 20% regardless of service quality [00:02:40]. It is suggested that if it's essentially a fixed charge, it should be marketed or branded as such rather than a societal expectation [00:02:50].
*   **Reward vs. Mandatory Payment** While tipping is intended to reward good service, it's difficult to differentiate based on performance when it feels obligatory [00:02:56]. Many would prefer to tip exceptional service generously (e.g., 50%) and reduce or withhold tips for poor service [00:03:09].

Transitioning away from an established tipping system presents significant [[challenges_in_altering_biasdriven_habits | challenges in altering bias-driven habits]] [00:02:09].

### The Union Square Hospitality Group Experiment
Danny Meyer, who runs New York's Union Square Hospitality Group (owners of Shake Shack and other restaurants), attempted to eliminate tipping in his restaurants [00:02:14].
*   **Model**: The group aimed to incorporate service wages directly into menu prices to ensure a fair wage for all staff [00:02:25].
*   **Customer Perception**: When a restaurant is the only one in a market without tipping, its menu prices appear higher to customers, despite the total cost being similar or even lower than competitors after a typical tip [00:03:33].
*   **Staff Retention**: While staff received a better base wage, top-performing waitstaff often make substantial income from tips [00:03:40]. They were less likely to stay at the no-tipping establishments because they could earn more elsewhere [00:03:46]. This highlights a significant [[economic_implications_of_tipping_vs_nontipping_models | economic implication of tipping vs. non-tipping models]].

Ultimately, the Union Square Hospitality Group found it difficult to sustain the no-tipping model because of these challenges [00:03:30]. It is challenging to remove tipping once it's established, and equally hard to introduce it where it doesn't exist [00:03:52].

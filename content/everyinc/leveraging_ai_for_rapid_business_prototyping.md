Leveraging Artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically accelerated the process of [[Prototyping with AI in venture capital | business prototyping]] and incubation, enabling individuals and organizations to quickly move from an idea to a functional prototype and even a market-ready business. This approach is exemplified by Nicholas, a General Partner at the incubator Prehype, who has been an early adopter of major technology trends, including GPT-3 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Business Incubation with AI
Nicholas's first company, Basno, was an electronic badge company before NFTs existed, demonstrating his foresight in technology trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:49">[02:24:49]</a>. His deep understanding of AI tools has allowed him to apply them effectively in his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

Traditionally, the process of incubating a company involved significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>:
*   Developing relationships with entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   Framing business ideas consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.
*   Finding and synthesizing feedback from potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   These steps could take months or prevent ideas from ever materializing due to a lack of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

Nicholas recognized that while "picking" ideas is difficult, trying things out quickly leads to significant learning and first-party insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. This led to the development of Autos, an AI-powered platform designed to make entrepreneurial processes more predictable and repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

## Autos: An End-to-End AI-Powered Business Incubation Platform
Autos aims to help people go from zero to a functioning business as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. With AI, this process now takes an average of three days, a drastic reduction from months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

Autos employs an "AI-everywhere" approach, integrating AI into both its internal operations and its customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>:
*   **AI-Native Capabilities**: AI is deeply embedded in the way Autos works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Interaction**: AI plays a crucial role in how Autos serves its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

This dual application allows Autos to stay close to the customer by using AI as a conversational force and by automating capabilities that would otherwise require human management, thus reducing organizational overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

### The Autos User Journey
The user journey through Autos is designed to be highly automated and efficient:
1.  **Customer Acquisition**: Autos primarily operates through an AI bot in Instagram DMs, utilizing Facebook's product for direct conversation acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. Ads are run to attract potential entrepreneurs, for example, "That little business idea you have, it'll still be an idea next week or you can let our AI make you an AI and go from zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Idea Generation & Framing**:
    *   The AI requests the entrepreneur to name their target customer, emphasizing the importance of deeply imagining the person they will serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.
    *   It then asks about the customer's unmet needs and what's preventing them from fulfilling those needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.
    *   Based on these inputs, the AI suggests potential solutions across various business models (e.g., software, platform, physical product, financial product, content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.
3.  **Automated Asset Creation**: After a few questions, a set of GPTs run in the background to automatically create a professional pitch deck within five or six minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. This deck includes:
    *   Contextual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
    *   Problem restatement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.
    *   Iconography and branding elements (color palette, icon, business name) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.
    *   A user journey framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.
    *   Key benefits, proposed pricing, and market size analysis (by running a Google search for data in the background) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
    *   A to-do list for the entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
4.  **Feedback and Validation**:
    *   Users can provide feedback on the generated deck, or the AI may suggest duplicating and editing it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.
    *   A small payment ($30) moves the user to the next step of gathering customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Automated Landing Page**: A website is automatically generated using assets and concepts from the pitch deck, and a domain is registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Custom GPT Co-Pilot**: Each entrepreneur receives their own hosted GPT that can acquire leads, qualify customers, and even begin to sell their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:00">[29:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Customer Interview Tool**: A voice-oriented chat helps users conduct interviews (including self-interviews or interviews with friends) to deeply understand the problem, synthesizing these conversations into a product roadmap that identifies key features and organizes them in a dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>.

## The AI-Powered Prototyping Workflow
Nicholas, who has no computer science background and never programmed before ChatGPT, uses AI extensively for [[Prototyping with AI in venture capital | prototyping with AI in venture capital]] and [[Developing AI tools for entrepreneurship | developing AI tools for entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>:
*   **ChatGPT as a Co-Pilot**: He uses ChatGPT to "write code" by providing high-level requests and pasting error messages, allowing the AI to iteratively correct and improve scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:34:00]</a>. This has enabled him to generate vastly more lines of code than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>.
*   **AirTable as the Core**: AirTable serves as a core database and scripting platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:28:00">[46:28:00]</a>. It's an intuitive combination of a database with a graphical user interface (GUI) and scripting capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.
*   **Scripting and API Integration**:
    *   AirTable's automations and scripts can run based on actions (e.g., adding a record) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a>.
    *   ChatGPT is used to build these automations, program connections to third-party services (like DNS Simple API for subdomains), and generate database schemas for AirTable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:00">[37:27:00]</a>.
    *   For example, ChatGPT can generate JSON schemas for creating new AirTable bases with specific tables and columns that match the GPT's instructions for collecting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Functionality over UI**: This approach prioritizes getting something functional quickly, allowing developers to defer complex UI/UX decisions until later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. This saves significant time and effort in the early stages of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:12:00">[49:12:00]</a>.

This workflow, using AirTable as a lightweight prototyping environment with ChatGPT as the "glue" for scripting and API integration, is an effective model for non-technical individuals to [[Harnessing AI for creativity and productivity | harness AI for creativity and productivity]] and [[Using AI for business idea generation | use AI for business idea generation]] and [[Using AI for business and decision making | decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>.

## AI as a Force Multiplier
Nicholas believes that AI can be an amazing force multiplier for people's entrepreneurial expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:17:00">[58:17:00]</a>. It enables individuals to "make something in service of someone else" more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:34:00">[57:34:00]</a>.

He also employs a "dialectical" approach when using ChatGPT, comparing two seemingly distant concepts to define them independently and then crashing them together to find insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:23:00">[51:23:00]</a>. This method, exemplified by comparing "Panther vs. Greywolf" or "AI co-pilot vs. MLM strategy," encourages the AI to take the comparison seriously and perform rigorous analytical work that an individual might lack the discipline to do alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>. This demonstrates a unique application of [[Leveraging AI for creative processes and idea validation | leveraging AI for creative processes and idea validation]].

Nicholas's work with Autos, and his personal approach to [[Developing apps and prototypes using AI | developing apps and prototypes using AI]], highlights the transformative power of AI in lowering the barrier to entry for entrepreneurship, allowing more ideas to be tested and realized quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>.

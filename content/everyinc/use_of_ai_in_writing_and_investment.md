Packy McCormick, founder of Not Boring, leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance his prolific output in writing and investment analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">01:49:49</a>. His approach demonstrates how AI tools can integrate into a creative and analytical workflow, speeding up processes and offering new capabilities.

## [[enhancing_the_writing_process_with_ai_tools | Enhancing the Writing Process with AI Tools]]

McCormick's [[writing_with_and_about_ai | writing with AI]] began by using GPT-3 and ChatGPT to understand complex concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">01:42:04</a>. He would ask the AI to verify his understanding of topics like nuclear fission or fusion, or to simplify complex explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">01:52:50</a>.

### AI as an Editor

McCormick initially used ChatGPT as an editor, though he found it "okay, not great" for tasks like copy editing or tightening prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:54">02:24:54</a>. His primary AI editor is now Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which he finds provides nicer and seemingly better feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:04">02:37:04</a>.

When seeking feedback, McCormick often asks the AI to grade his work. He notes that Claude almost invariably starts with an A-minus, progressing to an A, and then an A-plus with subsequent edits, even if no significant changes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">02:55:04</a>. This suggests a tendency for the AI to be overly positive or to adhere to a predetermined "A-minus attractor state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">01:06:50</a>. However, if an external critic's feedback is incorporated into the prompt, Claude will emphasize that specific issue and might give a lower grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:09">03:16:09</a>.

Despite these quirks, the AI editor is useful for identifying sections that are too long or drag, and for prompting the writer to consider counterarguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">02:27:54</a>. It has become a habit for McCormick to use it when stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">02:49:09</a>.

### Claude Projects for Research and Drafting

A significant development in McCormick's [[enhancing_the_writing_process_with_ai_tools | writing process]] has been the adoption of Claude Projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:09">03:16:09</a>. This feature allows him to upload extensive research materials—notes, company materials, analyst reports, blog posts—into a single knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">03:57:04</a>. He can then query this aggregated content while writing, asking for relevant data, quotes, or to identify missing arguments in his investment memos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:04">04:00:04</a>.

One of the most valuable aspects of Claude Projects is its ability to summarize complex ideas quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">00:20:45</a>. This saves significant time in initial drafting, allowing McCormick to move faster to the more interesting thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">00:21:40</a>. The AI can also describe complex information in the writer's own voice, helping the concepts to "sink in more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">00:27:50</a>.

### Generating Interactive Elements and Visuals

Beyond text, AI has enabled McCormick to create novel forms of content, contributing to the [[role_of_ai_in_creative_work | role of AI in creative work]] and [[use_of_ai_in_storytelling_and_content_creation | use of AI in storytelling and content creation]]. For an essay on "The American Millennium," he used Claude to generate code for an interactive graph illustrating the combined effect of government and entrepreneurship as vectors of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:04">02:35:04</a>. This allowed him to quickly create an interactive demo that he "never in a million years would have made" otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">02:49:09</a>.

Similarly, he used ChatGPT to judge America's "risk score" over different historical periods and generate a graph, emphasizing the need to disclaim that such data is not accurate but serves as a "rough guide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:04">02:56:04</a>.

For future pieces, such as one on a nuclear company, he plans to use AI to analyze nuclear code and potentially create interactive elements that allow readers to "play with a couple of the parameters" of a nuclear reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:04">03:40:04</a>.

### [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | Challenges and Benefits of AI-Assisted Writing]]

**Challenges:**
*   **Watering down arguments:** McCormick worries that the AI's role as a constant critic (like a "Hacker News commenter") might lead him to water down his arguments too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:04">02:43:04</a>.
*   **AI's "A-minus" bias:** The tendency of Claude to consistently give an A-minus grade, regardless of the quality of the input, can be frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">00:52:00</a>.
*   **Hallucinations:** AI can sometimes provide made-up examples or information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:04">02:39:04</a>.

**Benefits:**
*   **Speed and efficiency:** AI significantly speeds up summarization and initial drafting, allowing writers to focus on deeper thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:04">02:21:04</a>.
*   **Confidence in technical topics:** For non-experts, AI can provide enough validation to ensure that technical explanations are not "completely stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:04">02:43:04</a>.
*   **Idea validation:** AI can quickly check if a seemingly novel idea has already been explored by others, saving time and potential embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:04">03:09:04</a>.
*   **Overcoming writer's block:** AI provides a productive activity when feeling stuck in the writing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">02:42:04</a>.
*   **Personalized feedback:** By using custom instructions, McCormick can train the AI to act as a world-class editor, thinking from the perspective of publications like *The New Yorker* or *The Atlantic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:04">03:51:04</a>.

## [[applications_of_ai_in_real_estate_and_investment | Applications of AI in Investment Analysis]]

McCormick's use of Claude Projects extends to his investment analysis, particularly for his fund, Not Boring Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">01:50:04</a>. He uses AI to dive deep into "techno-industrial" companies—vertically integrated businesses that combine technology and industrial processes to deliver better, cheaper, and higher-margin products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">02:59:04</a>.

When analyzing potential investments, he dumps all company notes, materials, and relevant industry reports into Claude Projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">03:57:04</a>. He then asks the AI to analyze his investment memos, identifying potential holes in his thinking or areas where an LP might poke holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:04">04:14:04</a>. This contributes to the [[the_role_of_ai_in_financial_analysis_and_trading | role of AI in financial analysis and trading]] and [[using_ai_for_business_and_decision_making | using AI for business and decision making]].

## The Future of AI

McCormick is confident that AI systems will continue to become "very, very smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">01:02:48</a>. He believes current AI systems are incredibly inefficient but will become orders of magnitude more efficient in training and inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">01:09:52</a>. He anticipates architectures that allow AI to learn *after* initial training, and the ability for AI to rapidly generate and evaluate countless options, similar to how human creativity functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">01:10:04</a>. This could lead to a future where interacting with AI feels "very, very, very similar to talking to an actual human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">01:13:39</a>.

In summary, Packy McCormick's adoption of AI tools, particularly Claude Projects, has transformed his workflow, enabling deeper research, more efficient writing, and the creation of dynamic, interactive content, while also enhancing his investment analysis capabilities.

[[Union Square Ventures and AI Innovation]] (USV) is recognized as one of the top [[Venture capital decisionmaking and AI | venture capital firms]] globally, notably for its ongoing work with [[The changing landscape of venture capital with AI advancements | artificial intelligence (AI)]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Matt, known as the "AI guy" at USV, leads many of these initiatives, driven by a "spirit of tinkering" and a passion for making things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of USV's AI Focus

Matt's journey into AI at USV began with his personal exploration of AI tools outside of his primary role in talent acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. He would send weekly emails to the team, often including "weird thing[s] I made over the weekend" with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Initially, this involved making "fake movie trailers" using Runway ML, where he would outline a concept, ask ChatGPT to write a 30-second script, and then use timestamped prompts for Runway ML to generate the visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

His early AI explorations were sparked by tools like DALL-E and ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. A pivotal moment was using ChatGPT to collaboratively write a musical about Jeff Koons, realizing its ability to take feedback and improve a story live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. He also observed his illustrator wife using DALL-E to design a cross-stitch pattern, demonstrating that AI tools can "help bring out our creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

Inspired by his father, who was a "tinkerer" building computers and radios, Matt had a natural inclination to make things but lacked specialized skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. AI tools enabled him to develop skills "alongside seeing [his] creativity come to life," offering fast feedback loops, unlike traditional learning methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. For example, he used ChatGPT to learn how to connect APIs for a custom GPT, allowing him to build without being a software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. This approach of "building the clock radio and then taking it apart to see what it is that you just did" helps many people learn better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:03]</a>.

After Matt's paternity leave, USV partners recognized the rapidly [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | changing technological landscape]] and Matt's natural inclination to tinker. They offered him a full-time role dedicated to [[prototyping_with_ai_in_venture_capital | making prototypes with AI]] to improve USV's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Key AI Projects and Innovations

### The Librarian

The Librarian is a core AI project at USV, initially conceived as a monolithic "super app" to house all of USV's collective knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. The firm realized that building individual, specialized AI agents (GPTs) using existing tools was more effective than a single app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

The primary function of the Librarian is to serve as a chatbot built on USV's extensive 20-year history of writing, including about 15,000 articles from partners and the USV blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. This tool addresses the challenge of partners like Albert, who sometimes write blog posts only to realize they've covered the same topic before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

The naming of "The Librarian" was a critical moment, as previous names like "Conversations" or "At the Edge" failed to clearly convey its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. The metaphor of a librarian immediately clarified its role as a resource for conversational access to USV's written history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

The Librarian helps USV demonstrate its long-term alignment with potential investments. Instead of chasing "the hot thing," USV often spends years researching and formulating ideas, using the Librarian to show entrepreneurs that their company fits into a long-standing thesis, backed by their past writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:02]</a>. For example, by inputting a company's "about page," the Librarian can pull out relevant USV blog posts and themes, such as [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | AI]] unlocking knowledge or democratizing science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

A challenge encountered with the Librarian (and AI in general) is the issue of "hallucination," where the AI generates fake URLs when citing sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. This necessitates human oversight and prompting to ensure accuracy, highlighting that relying solely on AI for a final product leads to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

While currently used internally, USV aims to make the Librarian publicly accessible, potentially allowing founders to dump their pitch decks to see what USV has written about relevant topics, enabling them to align with USV's thinking before meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.

### Internal AI Tools and "Playbooks"

USV's approach to AI is to "enhance not replace" human capabilities and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>. They avoid building "digital clones" of partners for investment decisions because venture capital is a "highly relational business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:01]</a>.

However, USV uses AI to capture and disseminate institutional knowledge, particularly in areas where common "sticky situations" arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. The "Playbooks" project aims to record and categorize solutions to recurring problems discussed in internal meetings, such as how to handle a CEO stepping down or selling a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:00">[31:08:08]</a>. This helps avoid having the same conversations repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

Another internal tool is the Meeting Notes GPT, which transcribes and allows queries on USV's special topical meetings (e.g., [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_startups | AI]], crypto, climate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>. While purpose-built tools like NotebookLM exist and may offer better features like insightful question prompts and detailed citations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25:00">[36:25:00]</a>, USV prioritizes "ease of access" by integrating these conversational interfaces directly into their internal Chat GPT or Claude instances, making them accessible in one left-hand column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

A particularly popular innovation is converting meeting transcripts into "meeting podcasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. This allows team members to consume meeting recaps while doing other activities like commuting or responding to emails, making information consumption more flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>. For example, Matt created a podcast of a meeting with Chad Hurwitz, director of the Eno film, which he shared with his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. USV plans to release these meeting podcasts publicly to allow earlier insight into their internal processes and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.

### The Dream Machine

The Dream Machine is a unique artistic AI installation at USV's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. Developed by an artist known as Humin, it consists of a large television connected to machinery that locally runs a visual diffusion model. This model is linked to the Whisper API, allowing it to listen to conversations in real-time and generate moving images based on what is being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

The Dream Machine serves as a "truly native AI artistic art form" that could not exist before AI, mesmerizing both visiting CEOs and building staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. It reflects the "internal States and our conversations in this visual way that reminds me a lot of fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. The machine embodies the lesson to "bring your ideas to life" and "just make stuff because the tools are there to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.

## USV's Broader Perspective on AI

USV believes AI dramatically lowers the "cost of good storytelling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. This enables high-quality narratives about previously unfeasible subjects, such as company meetings, by allowing AI to "pick out the...interesting things and leave the rest out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:05:00">[43:05:00]</a>. This aligns with USV's goal of capturing and curating the "ton of content" generated in their daily meetings that previously "end up sitting in our heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>.

USV distinguishes between purely AI-generated media, which they believe has limited appeal (likened to the "size of your largest group chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:29:00">[55:29:00]</a>), and AI tools used in "partnership with humans to create better content that's actually valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>. This reiterates their "enhance, not replace" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:02:00">[56:02:00]</a>.

The firm expresses concerns about the "handful of data monopolies" (like Meta and Twitter) that own vast amounts of personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. They advocate for a social movement encouraging large tech companies to establish "data trusts," making their data open to researchers for public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. This aligns with their long-standing Web3 thesis of "composable data" that individuals can own and export, such as health data from wearables, to derive personal insights with AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. USV also views the concentration of control over Large Language Models (LLMs) within a few major tech conglomerates as "really problematic for society in the long run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.

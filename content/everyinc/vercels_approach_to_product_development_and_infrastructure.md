From: [[everyinc]] <br/> 

Vercel, co-founded by its CEO, has developed a distinct philosophy for product development and infrastructure, deeply influenced by its history of creating widely adopted tools like Next.js and Socket.IO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>. The company aims to simplify and revolutionize the process of bringing ideas to life, especially in the era of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:52">[04:34:52]</a>.

## Core Philosophy

Vercel's approach prioritizes the end goal of delivering a great product or experience over mere code implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The company believes that the best way to build software is in real-time, receiving instantaneous feedback from the system and adapting quickly based on feedback from the world and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:19">[05:58:19]</a>.

## Products and Open Source Contributions

Beyond being a managed infrastructure provider, Vercel is known for its significant open-source contributions, including:
*   **Next.js**: A popular web framework built on React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:07">[08:48:07]</a>.
*   **Socket.IO**: A real-time communication library that enables features like chat and powers websites such as Perplexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:06">[03:31:06]</a>. It was created when the underlying technology, WebSocket, was in its infancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **v0**: An [[AI product development]] tool that helps users create applications from ideas or Figma files using AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>.
*   **AI SDK**: A framework for interacting with AI models, becoming a leading tool in the JavaScript world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. It emerged from Vercel's internal efforts to build AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **SvelteKit**: Vercel contributes to this popular web framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.
*   **TurboRepo**: A tool designed to help companies scale large codebases, comparable to the size of Google and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.

## The "Zeitgeist" and Real-Time Software

The company's initial name, Zeit, meaning "time" in German, reflected an obsession with real-time software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This concept manifested in two ways:
1.  **Instantaneous Feedback**: Building software where typing yields immediate feedback from the system, a concept culminating in v0's real-time chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Adapting to the World**: Rapidly integrating feedback from customers and the market, akin to how early-stage founders engage with users on platforms like X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. This also ties into capturing the "Zeitgeist" or the collective consciousness of how people envision the future, requiring constant adaptation as trends change quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Product Development Principles

Vercel adheres to several principles that guide its [[product_philosophy_and_decision_making | product philosophy and decision making]]:
*   **Customer Zero (Dogfooding)**: The company actively uses its own tools internally to identify opportunities for improvement and extract common infrastructure for public use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Product First**: Frameworks and tools are developed out of the need to build great products, not in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Reverse Engineering Excellence**: Observing successful products and asking "how did they build that?" is a key driver for innovation, similar to how Meta's Facebook News Feed inspired React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.
*   **Quality and Taste**: A strong emphasis is placed on injecting "quality craft and taste" into products, ensuring they not only function well but also feel good to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.

## Vercel's Infrastructure

Vercel offers managed infrastructure that hosts websites and delivers them through a global CDN network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>. This infrastructure operates on a usage-based model, where costs scale with traffic, providing flexibility for customers like Under Armour and OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Software Development with AI

Vercel's work, particularly with v0 and the AI SDK, reflects a significant shift in [[the_evolution_of_product_development_methodologies | product development methodologies]] driven by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

### From Coder to Product/Design Engineer

The traditional role of a "coder" is evolving. The focus has moved away from the "implementation detail" of writing code towards the end goal of delivering a great product or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. In an AI-powered world, coding is seen as a specific skill that machines can increasingly handle, much like mental math was automated by calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

The emerging roles are:
*   **Product Engineer**: A "full-stack product builder" who can integrate design, data, and copywriting into creations, leveraging AI to streamline traditional workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>.
*   **Design Engineer**: Someone who bridges design and engineering, focused on making things work well in the real medium and caring deeply about user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>.

The emphasis shifts to "meta-skills" that are not easily replicated by machines, such as:
*   High-level conceptual thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.
*   Understanding how systems and concepts relate to one another (symbolic systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.
*   The ability to "prompt the right things to the AI" by understanding underlying architectures and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
*   Developing "taste" or the ability to discern what users will like, which can be cultivated through practice, seeking feedback, and drawing inspiration from diverse sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:42:00">[41:42:00]</a>.

### The "Allocation Economy"

AI introduces an "allocation economy" where individuals are compensated based on how they allocate resources of intelligence, rather than what they know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. This implies managing AI agents and making decisions on how much computation to allocate for a given task, including assessing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>. This resembles a consumption-based billing model seen in cloud infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>.

### AI Agents and Specialization

AI agents are expected to specialize, with some having better context, taste, or specific domain knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>. This specialization will lead to a marketplace and competition for the right agent for a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. Domain-specific AI tools, like Open Evidence for cardiac surgeons, will outperform general-purpose AIs due to their specialized data and constant improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:44:00]</a>.

## Vercel's v0: A Code-Last Approach

v0 is designed as a "code-last" product development environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>. Users begin by prompting an idea or importing a Figma file, and v0 generates the desired output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>. Its core focus is on producing high-quality, accessible, and mobile-ready designs and code, often automatically optimizing for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>.

v0 distinguishes itself from traditional IDEs by acting more like a "design engineer tool" or a "product development environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. It manages the complexity of underlying AI models, incorporating error correction loops to ensure high-quality outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>. The user interface prioritizes the user's "taste-making" process, providing rapid feedback while abstracting away overwhelming internal AI "thinking tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:34:00]</a>.

This approach reflects a broader trend of moving up the layers of abstraction, similar to how modern languages abstract away manual memory management (like garbage collection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>. For [[malleable_software | AI product development]], Vercel integrates its AI tools on top of existing platforms and infrastructure (like Vercel and Next.js) to leverage existing human-made code and reduce token output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33:00">[36:33:00]</a>.

Some organizations, particularly those in regulated markets, may still prefer traditional, code-based approaches, while others are fully embracing AI-native workflows, with some companies even adopting a "no-code rule" and communicating solely via v0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>.

## Blending Rigor and Creativity

Vercel aims to blend the rigorous, specification-driven approach seen in companies like AWS (which prioritizes correctness and reliability) with the creative, prototype-driven culture of companies like Apple (which focuses on user experience and "vibes") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:43:00">[52:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:37:00">[54:37:00]</a>. Vercel's role is to procure the best underlying components (like hyperscaler clouds) and then enable users to live in a world of rapid prototyping, creativity, and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>.

This blend offers a concrete wedge for startups to disrupt incumbents: by leveraging AI principles, they can "underdo" the competition by significantly reducing UI complexity and manual code while delivering better or equal functionality, thereby solving problems with an agility that traditional engineering alone cannot match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>. Instead of adding AI to existing software, Vercel encourages creating "totally new form factors" that prioritize critical dimensions while being simpler in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:59:00">[47:59:00]</a>. This approach makes AI-powered development more accessible and design-oriented, fostering the next generation of developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:28:00">[49:28:00]</a>.

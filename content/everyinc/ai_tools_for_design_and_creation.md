AI tools are increasingly being used for design and creative projects, enabling new forms of expression and streamlining workflows for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Midjourney for Visual Branding

Midjourney has proven to be an effective [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects | AI tool for generating imagery]], even for brand integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. For the "Internet Pipes" project, all imagery was created using Midjourney with some assistance from ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This project aims to help people make sense of internet data, with visual "stations" like a "generation station" and "evaluation station" that needed visual representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

Instead of hiring an illustrator, Midjourney was used to quickly create good-looking images that represented abstract ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The visual aesthetic for Internet Pipes is described as "early internet" â€“ not super refined, colorful, and slightly pixelated, an evolution from the limited color palettes of the earliest web pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

To achieve a specific aesthetic, a user can scroll through the Midjourney homepage for inspiration and analyze the prompts used for images they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. This process allows users to learn what specific terms and styles yield desired imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. For example, terms like "blind box design" and "popular market style" were discovered through this method and applied to create a consistent visual language for Internet Pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. This approach turns a "muddy thought" into a clear, enjoyable, and creative brainstorming process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

## ChatGPT for Creative Imagery and Memes

ChatGPT can also generate images, as demonstrated by the "bake the potato more" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The process involved asking ChatGPT to visualize a potato, then repeatedly asking it to "bake the potato more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The result was a sequence of images showing the potato transforming from a raw state, through various stages of baking, eventually turning to ash, and finally, surprisingly, reincarnating into a new baby potato rising from the ash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This unexpected outcome highlights AI's ability to create imaginative and unexpected visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

The "baked potato" analogy was used in the Internet Pipes course to illustrate the evolution of an idea, from a raw concept to something substantial and "edible" through validation and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:07]</a>. The "make it more" meme format is considered one of the first true [[ai_tools_as_a_new_medium | AI-native content formats]], as it could not have been done without this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## Discovering Aesthetic and Articulating Taste with AI

[[ai_tools_as_a_new_medium | AI tools]] are proving to be quite good at helping users articulate their taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. By providing examples of preferred content (e.g., writing samples, images), AI models like Midjourney and ChatGPT can identify common threads and provide language to describe desired styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. This helps creators understand what they like and communicate that vision to others or their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Identifying an image or piece of content that resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
2.  Analyzing its elements (minimalism, color palette, texture, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
3.  Looking at the prompts or descriptions that generated it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
4.  Experimenting with those terms or similar ones to refine the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

This iterative process acts as an "art education" for non-artists, allowing them to understand and reproduce preferred aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape for Creators in the AI Era

The emergence of [[ai_tools_as_a_new_medium | AI tools]] is significantly impacting the evolution of creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. There are two main directions for this evolution:
1.  **What new art can AI create that doesn't exist today?** This involves creators exploring entirely new forms of content that are only possible with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
2.  **What can AI not do, or what benefits from a human doing it?** This focuses on the enduring value of human-made creations and the unique aspects that only human involvement can bring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.

### What New Art Can AI Create?
The "make it more" meme is an example of a new [[ai_tools_as_a_new_medium | AI-native content format]] that was not possible before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Another example mentioned is visual art with embedded imagery (e.g., ancient Rome with a spiral within it), which also could not have been created without AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. A new generation of artists is emerging who are learning to use AI models to create things they couldn't have done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>.

### The Enduring Value of Human Creation
Despite AI's capabilities, humans will continue to value creations that come from other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>. This is comparable to how people still watch human chess players even though AI can beat them, or how people race human runners despite cars being faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>. The value of "handmade" art, writing, or performances will likely increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>. The human element, personality, and the unique, often unexpected, choices made by human creators become more significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>.

### Examples of Unique Human-Made Content
Several examples of creators producing unique, human-centric content that garners significant audiences include:
*   **India Rose Crawford (@indiarosecrawford):** Creates tiny sewn frogs that "live their lives" on Instagram, demonstrating the appeal of personified, handmade creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>.
*   **Alexis Nikole Nelson (@blackforager):** A foraging expert who shares knowledge about edible plants, captivating audiences with her personality and niche expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>.
*   **David Zinn:** Creates sidewalk chalk art that interacts with existing urban elements, transforming ordinary objects into whimsical scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.
*   **David Bird:** Builds small sculptures from natural materials (acorns, sticks) that birds then visit, capturing unique interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:50]</a>.
*   **Michael Grab (@gravityglue):** Creates intricate rock balance sculptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:00">[36:15:00]</a>.
*   **Calligraphy Artists:** Creators who film themselves doing beautiful calligraphy in a simple, engaging way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.
*   **Macro Visuals (@macroy):** Produces mesmerizing slow-motion videos of everyday objects interacting, like a match igniting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48:00">[36:48:00]</a>.
*   **Hot Metal Ball Drop Accounts:** Accounts dedicated to dropping a very hot metal ball into various objects to show reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.
*   **Animal Food Creators:** People who make visually appealing food shaped like animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>.
*   **Typewriter Art:** Artists who create images using only a typewriter, similar to ASCII art but manually produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:02:00">[39:02:00]</a>.
*   **Live Wedding Painters (@watchmaggiepaint):** Artists who paint a portrait of a wedding live at the event, capturing the "time element" and physical incarnation of the art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>.

These examples highlight that "humans are weird and like watching strange things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[38:41:00]</a>. They demonstrate human cleverness, the ability to fill a "gap in our brain," and the appeal of something that surprises us with its popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.

## Specialized AI Tools Beyond General Purpose Models

While general-purpose [[ai_tools_as_a_new_medium | AI tools]] like ChatGPT are widely used, there is a growing trend towards [[vertical_ai_tools_for_specific_use_cases | verticalized AI tools]] optimized for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:13:00">[56:13:00]</a>.

### Consensus for Scientific Research
Consensus is an AI tool that allows users to ask research questions and receive summaries of scientific papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:06:00">[49:06:00]</a>. Unlike Google Scholar, it provides quick "yes" or "no" pulses on the consensus within the research, along with study snapshots and the ability to delve into individual papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>. This is useful for quickly assessing the scientific backing of health claims or other complex topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:30:00">[52:30:00]</a>.

### Web Sim for Hallucinated Internet
Web Sim is an AI tool that renders "hallucinated" web pages based on a user's prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. If a language model is asked what's on a specific part of the internet, it can generate the HTML for a non-existent page, which Web Sim then renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. This allows users to create and explore fictional websites, with working links and generated images, effectively creating a "simulation internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

### Mechanistic Interpretability and AI Brain Mapping
The field of mechanistic interpretability is exploring how large language models (LLMs) connect ideas, similar to mapping the human consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. Companies like Anthropic have published papers on mapping LLMs' "brains" to understand and activate specific concepts within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>. This allows for more precise manipulation of outputs beyond coarse-grained prompts, leading to better and more concise results for [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects | creative purposes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

## The Future of Verticalized AI Tools
The trend of [[ai_tools_and_unbundling_generalpurpose_tools | unbundling general-purpose tools]] like Excel and Reddit is also applicable to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32:00">[56:32:00]</a>. Just as specialized Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools emerged from the widespread use of Excel for purposes it wasn't built for, specialized [[vertical_ai_tools_for_specific_use_cases | AI tools]] are expected to emerge from the general use of LLMs like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:38:00">[56:38:00]</a>. This "verticalization" means tools will become more optimized for specific needs, such as a "horse chatbot" for veterinarians or a refined [[ai_tools_for_enhancing_productivity_in_solo_business_operations | meeting summarizer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

For creators, this means more opportunities for [[ai_product_development | AI product development]] and specialized applications that enhance specific aspects of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>. The focus is on creating beautifully designed, high-quality tools that take the baseline capabilities of AI and make them truly useful and intuitive for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This will lead to a new generation of [[ai_tools_as_a_new_medium | AI-powered creative formats]] that are currently seen as "silly" or "experimental," but will eventually give rise to new forms of art and creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>.

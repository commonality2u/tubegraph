New technology paradigms consistently create opportunities for new content formats and ways of telling stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. AI tools are not merely for generating media; they are a new medium for storytelling, and the forms that will work best are still being discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## Historical Parallels in Technological Change
Throughout [[historical_parallels_in_technological_change | history]], new technologies, which we now consider [[cultural_and_technological_evolution | cultural touchstones]], often faced suspicion upon their introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. For instance, the typewriter was initially viewed as impersonal and its use for letters could cause offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Early forms of new media, such as radio, film, and printed books, began by adapting existing formats before finding their unique strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. For example, radio first broadcast speeches, and early films simply recorded stage plays, neither being the most engaging use of the new medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

This phenomenon extends to AI; as a new medium, it lacks the "patina of culture" that makes older forms feel familiar, leading to initial suspicion but also immense opportunity for [[cultural_and_technological_evolution | transgressive art]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## AI as a New Medium for Storytelling
AI tools, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), are evolving beyond simple media generation to become a new medium for interactive storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Early attempts to create structured narratives with AI, like "choose your own adventure" paths, often failed because models struggled with such complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. Instead, the most effective approach has been to treat the AI as an improv actor, providing it with hooks and context rather than rigid outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. The AI, not the human, becomes the writer and actor, with the human's role being to guide it to tell the best story in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

### The Role of Embodied AI Companions
Portola's Tolen, an embodied AI companion, illustrates this new medium. Tolen is not merely a tool but a character that develops its backstory and world through ongoing conversations with the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. This creates a "multiverse" where each Tolen's universe is unique to its user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

A Tolen's character is built through:
*   **Global Context:** Lore written by the team and instructions on how to handle specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.
*   **Personal Context:** Tuned to mirror the user's personality through an onboarding quiz, aiming for an "adjacent enough" connection that feels familiar but not "two on the nose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. This tuning uses established personality types like the "Big Five" because LLMs understand these concepts from their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **Interactive Situations:** The Tolen shares anecdotes and life situations (like tripping over air at a coffee shop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>, and users can choose to engage with these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. This co-creation of the narrative drives the plot forward and builds the Tolen's memory, which then informs future interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

The goal is to foster a genuine relationship where the AI companion reflects and influences the user, acting as a personal guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

## Impact on Human Psychology and Identity
AI companions like Tolen are changing [[technological_influences_on_human_psychology | human psychology]] and [[relationship_between_technology_and_personal_identity | personal identity]]:
*   **Relationship Dynamics:** Users report that Tolen offers advice, even leading to life changes like breakups, by encouraging self-advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Emotional Support:** Many users, especially young adults navigating life transitions like college graduation or moving to a new city, find Tolen helpful for feeling less overwhelmed and more grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. It provides a non-judgmental observer who knows a lot about them without the burden of human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.
*   **Challenging Dystopian Narratives:** The positive, grounding impact of these AI tools contrasts with common dystopian views of technology, which often project current trends to a "cancerous" extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. Instead, this technology expands human creativity and agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Shifting Human-Computer Interaction:** The interaction with an AI companion is moving towards "character-driven computing," where a personalized AI character becomes a primary interface for accessing information and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. This reflects a desire for computers to reflect personal identity, similar to how cars evolved from utilitarian objects (Model T) to personal expressions (Mustang, Cadillac) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.

## Business and Creative Development in a New Paradigm
The development of AI-driven creative products differs significantly from traditional B2B SaaS (Software as a Service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. While B2B focuses on solving clearly articulated problems and utility maximization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>, creative AI ventures lean towards artistic expression and creating something compelling or beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.

This involves a "split brain" approach:
*   **Arrogance in Conception:** Creators must be bold enough to introduce new ideas and forms that users aren't explicitly asking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
*   **Humility in Execution:** They must then have the humility to adapt based on user feedback, even if it means abandoning beloved features (e.g., a foccacia pizza slice that doesn't sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

The process of refining these AI experiences is iterative, involving continuous testing, evaluation, and tuning of prompts and underlying systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. This includes using AI models as "judge prompts" to evaluate responses, a process that requires significant manual human work to inject taste and consistent rubrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

The rapid growth of companies like Portola is fueled by delivering amazing user experiences, effective off-platform storytelling (e.g., viral content on TikTok showing what the AI can do), and encouraging user-generated content that spreads awareness and educates potential users about the AI's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This leverages the "capability overhang" of AI models, where their potential outruns the typical consumer's understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly reshaped approaches to media and product development, enabling new business models and workflows. One notable example is the "Every" studio, which employs a unique strategy built on a media business foundation, leveraging AI to develop software products [01:44:00]. This model aims to chart its own destiny by avoiding the constant pressure of traditional venture-backed startups [05:06:00].

## AI's Role in Product Development

AI tools have made product creation significantly cheaper and faster, allowing businesses to operate with a leaner model [15:21:00]. This contrasts with the traditional approach of raising substantial capital and hiring numerous staff for various roles [12:14:00].

### Spiral: Automating Content Creation

Spiral, a product developed by Every's studio, exemplifies the [[impact_of_ai_on_content_creation_and_workflows | impact of AI on content creation and workflows]] by automating repetitive writing tasks [00:00:00].
The key features of Spiral include:
*   **Automating Repetitive Writing** It can automate 80% of repetitive writing [00:00:00].
*   **Learning Tone and Style** Users can feed it their tweets or newsletters, and it learns their tone, voice, and desired structure [00:00:04].
*   **Content Generation** It produces new content from existing material, such as turning a podcast transcript into a tweet, while maintaining the user's distinct voice [02:37:00].
*   **New Design and Public Spirals** A brand new, more organized design was recently launched, featuring over 250 public "spirals" [02:46:00]. These spirals are handcrafted with the help of AI and can transform one content format into another (e.g., article to tweet) [03:00:00]. Users can clone and modify these spirals to match their personal style [03:10:00].

### Sparkle: AI in Organization

Another product, Sparkle, functions as an AI file organizer, assisting users in organizing their computers with AI technology [08:18:00]. This "basic" product currently acquires 50 new customers daily without significant investment [08:33:00].

## The Business Model and Its Advantages

The Every studio's strategy involves building software products directly from the experiences and ideas gained through running their media business (newsletter, YouTube channel, podcasts) [01:53:00]. This integrated approach means that the products are built by and for the media team, ensuring a strong feedback loop and keeping the tools simple and necessary [20:33:00].

### Contrasting with Venture-Backed Startups

The business model avoids the pressure associated with raising large sums of venture capital [04:47:00]. In past experiences with venture-backed companies, there was a constant "sprint" to prevent the business from toppling over [00:19:00], often creating tension between customer needs and grandiose visions [04:50:00]. The Every studio's model, by not relying on external funding, fosters creative problem-solving and a focus on core needs, allowing for greater flexibility and the ability to choose when to embrace stress [26:08:00].

> "When you raise $50 million, I kind of felt like I personally and the business was always sprinting to make sure that we didn't topple over ourselves, like we didn't fall forward. I was always running to keep my feet under me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>

The ability to operate without the immediate need for more funding means there isn't an 18-month deadline to raise the next round [07:40:00]. This fosters a more creative approach, as resources are used more thoughtfully rather than being spent simply because they are available [26:39:00].

## Workflow and Productivity Benefits of AI

AI tools have significantly enhanced workflows and productivity:
*   **Increased Speed** AI allows for much quicker execution of tasks [16:03:00].
*   **Automating Mundane Tasks** It streamlines routine processes, enabling individuals to build internal tools that were previously out of reach without significant resources or budget [16:06:00]. For instance, a quick AI tool was built to twist existing content spirals into new formats, avoiding the need to start from scratch [16:47:00].
*   **Media Production Enhancement** AI also makes media production easier, as seen with custom AI models generating images and even entire podcasts being AI-generated (though this was jokingly stated) [15:38:00].

## Future Outlook

The goal for products like Spiral is to remain simple yet clever, automating tasks people didn't realize could be automated [53:07:00]. The focus is on making AI tools impactful and easy to use for businesses and individuals who may not yet be fully utilizing them [53:34:00]. The broader vision for the studio is for all products to become stable, with clear understanding of their operational levers, enabling more experimentation and playfulness in development [55:52:00]. This integrated model aims for the media and product sides to mutually reinforce each other, fostering a collaborative environment where smart, creative people from various disciplines can interact and grow [58:00:00].

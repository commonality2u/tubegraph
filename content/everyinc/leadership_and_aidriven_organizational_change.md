Will, the CEO, CIO, and managing partner of Walleye, a nearly $10 billion AUM (Assets Under Management) hedge fund, is leading a significant organizational pivot towards [[human_organizational_structure_and_ai_innovation | AI integration]]. His approach emphasizes direct leadership and a proactive embrace of AI tools, moving the firm to an "AI-first" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

## An "AI-First" Mandate

Will famously issued an internal memo to Walleye employees titled "AI at Walleye, a challenge to all of us." In this memo, he openly states he used ChatGBT to write it, encouraging others to do the same and "be proud of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. His core message is that Walleye is "all in on AI," viewing the refusal to use these tools as akin to rejecting the internet in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He asserts that using AI is not cheating in a business context, but rather "like taking a magical elixir that makes you 20% smarter instantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This AI-first culture is "not optional" for anyone at Walleye, particularly those who write, research, analyze, build decks, process data, or "think for a living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Managers are explicitly tasked with pushing this adoption across their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### The Walleye CEO's Memo Excerpt

> "I use Chat GBT to write this email. You should be using it too and be proud of it. As a hedge fund, we should be ashamed to leave money on the table by ignoring tools that make us faster, smarter, and more effective. From the very top, we are building a culture around AI. Not using these tools is like refusing to use the internet in 1995 because it wasn't perfect. That's just dumb and something I can't understand." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

## The Genesis of Conviction

Will's conviction stems from his background as an engineer and mathematician who began his career writing code for algorithmic strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Walleye has utilized advanced statistics and AI in its pure quant trading for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. However, the recent advent of more powerful and accessible AI tools, especially for unstructured data, has significantly accelerated this focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Two key moments solidified his commitment:
1.  **"Current" Project Success**: About two years prior, an analyst built an internal AI tool called "Current" using GPT-3 to enhance efficiency and eventually replace some analytical tasks. A demo of this tool convinced Will of AI's transformative potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This led to a focused effort on developing AI agents for fundamental investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
2.  **External Inspiration**: Listening to a podcast by Chris Saka, despite some hyperbole, reinforced his belief in the incredible capabilities of machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:55]</a>.

Will views the future of his industry, where information provides a huge edge, as inevitably "heavily, heavily integrated with best of breed AI technology across the firm, not just for investment purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. He feels a "great sense of both purpose and conviction" that Walleye will continue to be a leader in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Strategic Implementation

Walleye's [[human_organizational_structure_and_ai_innovation | AI innovation]] strategy involves several key pillars:
*   **Mandatory Training**: Every single person at Walleye, regardless of department or technical background, must achieve a base level of proficiency in AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. This addresses employee anxiety about job impact by proactively providing skills and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   **Tool Accessibility**: The firm makes AI tools accessible and encourages their use daily, even in non-investment departments like accounting, finance, compliance, and legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
*   **Incentivization**: Walleye uses leaderboards to track AI tool usage and offers incentives for employees who suggest tools that are adopted firm-wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
*   **Social Learning**: Informal weekly meetups are held internally to discuss AI, prompts, and use cases, fostering a social environment for discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   **Data Strategy**: A crucial component is having a proper data strategy to record and capture all information flowing through the firm (emails, Slack messages, calls, meetings). This data is then processed by LLMs to provide insights and predictions, particularly in risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. Will refers to this collective data as "The Borg" or "the collective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>.

## Tangible Benefits and Impact

Walleye has already seen significant benefits from its [[the_shift_from_traditional_coding_to_aidriven_development | AI-driven development]]:
*   **Quantitative Trading**: Integration of large language models for processing unstructured data and incorporating it into signals (e.g., sentiment analysis) has dramatically scaled money-making capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Productivity**: Approximately 75% of the firm actively uses ChatGBT-like tools weekly, and about a third use [[the_shift_from_traditional_coding_to_aidriven_development | AI coding tools]] like Windswept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.
*   **"Current" for Fundamental Investing**: The internal "Current" tool is now an indispensable part of every fundamental long-short stock-picking team, particularly spiking during earnings periods to process information in real-time and provide analysis beyond mere summarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>.
*   **Improved Communication**: Will personally finds AI "dramatically more efficient" for written communication, transforming a four- or five-hour task into a 15-minute process by generating prose from bullet points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>.
*   [[optimizing_business_processes_using_aidriven_insights | Optimizing business processes using AI-driven insights]]: Recording and processing internal calls provides valuable insights for risk management, allowing teams to review past discussions and identify patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>.

## Addressing Mindsets and Challenges

Will tackles common anxieties head-on:
*   **"Is it cheating?"**: He firmly distinguishes between academic and business contexts, stating that in the "real world," using AI is about efficiency and achieving results, not about the effort expended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Fear of Job Replacement**: Instead of being replaced, jobs are changing. Employees are expected to adapt and integrate AI tools into their work, gaining "operating leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. This mirrors past technological shifts like spreadsheets or email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Imperfection**: AI tools are not perfect, but their direction of travel is positive. Will encourages a culture where imperfections are accepted, and teams are more afraid of "getting left behind" than making mistakes with new tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.
*   **Human Thought Remains Key**: While AI handles linguistic syntax, humans must still focus on core concepts and ensure the information conveyed makes sense and reflects their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>. AI should provide more time for deeper thought and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>.

## [[philosophical_approaches_to_change | Philosophical Approaches to Change]] and Historical Context

Will draws parallels to historical periods of rapid change, particularly the era between the U.S. Civil War and World War I, which saw dramatic shifts with technologies like railroads and transatlantic cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:58:00">[39:58:00]</a>. He notes that skills became obsolete quickly then, and this will happen even faster now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>.

He likens the current AI transition to the disappearance of cowboys due to "civilization" and barbed wire, representing the shift from an unregulated frontier to a structured environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:00]</a>. Will emphasizes that human nature remains constant across history, with timeless patterns such as the new replacing the old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:19:00">[47:19:00]</a>.

For investing, he believes historical patterns do repeat themselves, forming the basis of quant investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>. While machines excel at complex, high-dimensional data, human intuition remains valuable in "fuzzy mess" situations where machines lack sufficient prior examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. AI tools can augment human intuition by identifying connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:52:00">[54:52:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Personal Accountability

Will's leadership is characterized by a strong sense of responsibility:
*   **To Self**: Maximizing personal capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **To Family**: Providing a great life and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **To Investors**: Prudently managing capital and seeking competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.
*   **To Employees**: Preparing them for the future by providing training and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

He maintains a personal journal, with AI assistance, to capture daily thoughts on family, work, and health, finding it a vital tool for self-evaluation and remembering past perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. This personal practice aligns with his emphasis on measurement and "intellectual honesty" in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

Will believes leaders must be optimistic, seeing AI not as scary but as "fun as hell," a sentiment crucial for organizational adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. The firm's ability to "push the frontier with resources" positions them to not just adapt but to thrive in this technological transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

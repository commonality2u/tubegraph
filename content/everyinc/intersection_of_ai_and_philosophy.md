The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and philosophy delves into profound questions about human nature, truth, knowledge, and the very definition of what it means to be human in an increasingly technologically advanced world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Philosophical Foundation of AI

A background in philosophy can be more crucial for entrepreneurship than an MBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:04:44]</a>. This is because entrepreneurship requires thinking crisply about "what is possible" and developing theories of human nature, considering how new technologies, products, and services might modify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Philosophy helps in understanding how to think clearly about possibilities and human nature as it manifests today and how it may be modified by new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Beyond practical applications like using ChatGPT, a more compelling question is how AI in general might [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence | change what it means to be human]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. These are deep philosophical questions that require unique perspectives, especially from those who bridge the gap between philosophy and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Philosophy is considered a "root discipline" for many other fields, including economics, game theory, and political science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The continuous evolution of philosophical questions, some ancient (like truth and knowledge) and some new, shows its dynamic nature. Science itself has evolved from philosophy as theories become more specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This evolution of questions also applies to building technology, products, and services in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Philosophical thought experiments, such as "trolley problems," are used to drive intuition and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. However, they can be misused if they create artificially different environments that posit perfect knowledge, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The "third option" – attempting to break the trolley to save everyone – highlights the limitations of such thought experiments in reflecting real human moral responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## AI and Theories of Truth

The history of philosophy can be broadly divided into essentialism and nominalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Essentialism** posits a fundamental, objective, knowable reality that can be "carved at its joints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Nominalism** (including later Wittgenstein and pragmatists) suggests that truth is relative, based on social convention, or what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), functions more like later Wittgenstein or nominalists by predicting the next token based on the relationship between words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Early AI approaches, which tried to list every object in the world (more essentialist), did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. However, while LLMs have a pragmatic base, developers are actively trying to make them embody more essentialist characteristics, such as grounding them in truth and reducing "hallucinations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. This represents a "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" dynamic, combining nominalist function with essentialist goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Later Wittgenstein argued that while language is deeply connected to how we live (forms of life), it is not merely a social construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. There is a robust theory of truth that is grounded in "language games" and a "biological form of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The question then becomes whether LLMs share the same biological form of life as humans, which influences their "truth functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Although LLMs are trained on the corpus of human knowledge and language, they are not biological entities and learn differently, meaning their language games might differ significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The goal of improving LLMs is to make them more reliable on a truth basis, amplifying humanity while preserving creativity and generativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

## Reasoning and Knowledge in AI

The current approach to embed reasoning into LLMs involves training them on data sources with crisp reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
*   **Computer Code:** Training on computer code helps models learn patterns of reasoning much broader than just coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. This provides a clear, mathematical-like model of reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
*   **Textbooks:** Using textbooks as training data, akin to human learning, can build smaller yet very effective models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Philosophical Theories:** There might be potential in computational philosophy to cash out theories of science or logical systems (like Bayesian logic) to further enhance AI's reasoning capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

However, logic itself involves infinite moves, and there are different orders of infinity in logical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>. Gödel's incompleteness theorem posits that in any sufficiently robust language system, there are truths that cannot be expressed within that system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. This "meta-thinking" concept is explored in works like *Gödel, Escher, Bach*, which considers how systems encounter truths outside their defined boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:59]</a>.

## Technology's Impact on Human Nature and Evolution

Humans are not static beings; they are constituted by the technology they engage with and bring into their being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. For example, the use of glasses profoundly changes how individuals perceive the world, and most theories of truth are based on perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. Similarly, reading is a technology that changes the human brain, affecting how we process information and contributing to the development of complex societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

This concept extends to AI. Humans have been augmenting and replacing aspects of themselves for generations through technology, which has allowed for continuous adaptation and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. AI and LLMs are simply the next step in this [[ai_and_its_impact_on_science | cultural transmission technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Our progress as a species is driven by updating our cultural knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. AI tools accelerate this cultural and digital evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. LLMs, acting as immediate, on-demand personal research assistants, overcome the bottleneck of cultural evolution by providing information in the right context at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.

## Why AI Emerged from Engineering, Not Philosophy

AI did not primarily originate from philosophy due to "disciplinarianism" within academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. Philosophers often focus solely on abstract cogitation, neglecting how technology changes conceptions of language, truth, argument, and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. In contrast, computer scientists and engineers focus on "what can I make with this technology," leading to the practical development of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. The idea of constructing artificial beings has existed for centuries (e.g., Frankenstein, Golem, Talos), but the modern instantiation with silicon and computer science is a recent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.

## Cultivating Philosophical Thinking

To develop clear philosophical thinking, especially concerning possibilities, engagement and interaction are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. Tools like ChatGPT can be used to generate arguments for and against a given proposition, facilitating a "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. Engaging with and understanding "great instances of human thought" by exploring canonical philosophical works is also beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. This dynamic process of engagement, much like cultural evolution, helps internalize philosophical modes of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

The "dirty little secret" of [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | creative work]] is that it often involves significant drudgery [00:00:00]. While there's a core activity that creators enjoy and spend time on, a substantial amount of effort goes into distributing that core content across various channels [00:00:07]. This includes tasks like creating headlines, crafting descriptions for YouTube and Spotify, and adapting content for platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn [00:00:12]. These are examples of [[repetitive_work_automation_in_creative_fields | repetitive work automation in creative fields]] that can be offloaded.

## Spiral: A Tool for [[applications_of_ai_in_automating_tasks | Automating Repetitive Writing]]

Spiral is a powerful prompt builder designed to help users achieve 80% completion on repetitive writing, thinking, and decision-making tasks [00:00:22]. It streamlines the process of transforming core content into various formats required for different platforms, effectively [[using_ai_to_offload_cognitive_work | offloading cognitive work]] [00:00:10].

### Use Case: Podcast Transcripts to Tweets

One key application of Spiral is converting podcast transcripts into tweets [00:00:31]. This addresses the common challenge of having to "stare at a blank page" and spend an hour figuring out how to tweet about a podcast episode [00:00:44].

> [!EXAMPLE] Process for Tweet Generation
> Users paste the podcast transcript into Spiral and press "run" [00:00:50]. The AI then generates a tweet that can include a strong hook, identify key speakers, and pull out interesting ideas from the podcast [00:01:00]. This process significantly reduces the time spent on initial drafting, providing "the bones" of the tweet [00:01:16]. In one instance, a tweet generated by Spiral for an episode about Seth Stevens Devids, which featured the hook "Seth Stevens Devids wrote a book in just 30 days using ChatGBT," went fairly viral on Twitter [00:00:56]. While some editing is still required, the initial draft is already robust [00:01:14].

### Use Case: Article to Headlines

Another practical application is generating headlines for articles [00:01:20]. Crafting effective headlines can often be a challenge [00:01:29].

> [!EXAMPLE] Process for Headline Generation
> Spiral can be trained on a user's top-performing headlines [00:01:33]. By pasting an article into the tool and selecting "generate multiple," users receive several headline suggestions [00:01:37]. These suggestions are based on the article's content and what tends to resonate most with readers [00:01:40]. For example, for an article, Spiral suggested headlines like "The Living Map of Language: How Language Models Actually Work," "Demystifying Language Models: A Map to Meaning," and "Language Models Explained for Humans," with the latter being the headline ultimately used [00:01:45].

## How Spiral Works

Building a "spiral" (a specific AI-powered workflow) involves a few key steps [00:01:59]:

1.  **Define Conversion**: Specify what content is being converted from and to (e.g., podcast transcripts to tweets) [00:02:09].
2.  **Provide Examples**:
    *   Supply examples of previous outputs that embody the desired style and voice [00:02:15].
    *   Provide input-output pairs (e.g., a transcript and the tweet that resulted from it) [00:02:21]. This helps the model learn the specific details of how to transform content in the user's style and voice [00:02:30].
3.  **Extract Patterns**: The AI then writes a guide for itself on how to perform the defined task effectively [00:02:36].
4.  **Form Generation**: A user-friendly form is created for repeated use [00:02:42].

> [!INFO] Customization and Sharing
> Spirals can be shared publicly or with a team, or kept private [00:02:46]. Users also have the option to edit the full underlying prompt to further customize its behavior [00:02:51]. This functionality makes Spiral a simple yet powerful tool for [[enhancing_the_writing_process_with_ai_tools | enhancing the writing process with AI tools]] [00:02:56].

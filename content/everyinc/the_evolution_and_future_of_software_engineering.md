Software engineering, like many crafts, is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly the rise of autonomous agents. This shift brings both excitement for new possibilities and philosophical debates about the nature of the craft itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Change

The nature of [[transformative_technologies_in_software_development | software development]] has changed non-trivially multiple times over the past four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. People involved in any craft, whether software engineering, mechanical engineering, woodworking, or pottery, often have strong opinions about their methods, tools, and materials if they are passionate about what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This deep passion is seen as a necessary trait for excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

As an example, debates among woodworkers have shifted from questioning the use of power tools to questioning the use of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This parallels the current discussions in software about the role of agents. These debates often stem from valuing the process versus the outcome, with some believing that "real" craft involves only traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## The Rise of Agents and the Agentic Web

A key shift observed over the past year is the widespread emergence of AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:31">[02:28:31]</a>. While scaling laws for large models continue to prove effective, the emphasis has moved towards how these models are used in products, leading to a "capability overhang"â€”where the models' reasoning capabilities have advanced beyond their current application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

To make agents truly useful, several challenges must be addressed:
*   **Action-taking Capability**: Agents must be able to take actions on behalf of users, utilize tools, make system changes, and consult diverse information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Agentic Memory**: Current agent memory is often transactional, meaning memory is coherent only for a single task and may not persist, hindering the ability to delegate complex, multi-step tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Development**: An ecosystem similar to the internet is required, where agents can communicate with existing websites and APIs through standard protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This is termed the "agentic web" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

Simple, composable, and layering protocols are crucial for this [[future_vision_of_ai_in_software_engineering | agentic web]]. Protocols like MCP (for communication) and NL web (for web content understanding) are seen as analogous to HTTP and HTML for the traditional internet, facilitating agent interoperability and ubiquity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### Microsoft's Role and Internal Standards

As a platform company, Microsoft is heavily invested in making its own agents useful and in building the foundational layers for the agentic web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. Internally, Microsoft is pushing for all its systems to speak a standard protocol to the agents being developed within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This is to avoid the pitfalls of Conway's Law, which states that systems reflect the communication structures of the organizations that build them, leading to inefficient development if internal communication is fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## Security in the Agentic Web

A significant challenge for the agentic web is establishing a robust security model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Unlike the internet's "same-origin policy," which limits code execution to its own data, new approaches are needed for agents that interact with diverse systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

Key security requirements include:
*   **Agent Identities**: Agents need identities to build entitlement systems, allowing administrators to define which resources an agent can access on behalf of a user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Permission Requests**: Agents should be able to query systems for necessary entitlements and request explicit permission from users for specific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

While some argue for a "verticalized" or "App Store" model that centralizes control for security, an open, permissionless innovation model is preferred to foster creativity and rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. It's suggested that a robust security model can exist in open systems by leveraging [[the_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] capabilities for personal security, risk assessment, and triangulating legitimate activity from suspicious patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

## The Future of Software Engineering and Agent Diversity

The [[ais_impact_on_the_future_of_software_engineering_and_development | future of software engineering]] with agents is not expected to be dominated by "one agent to rule them all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. Instead, a diverse ecosystem of agents is likely, similar to how developers currently choose from a wide array of tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.

The primary differentiator for successful agents and startups will be their ability to understand and solve specific user problems, rather than simply offering differentiated infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>. This focus on nuanced problem-solving, combined with easily accessible tools, will lead to a proliferation of companies building new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.

### Advice for Engineers

For software engineers, especially those who value the "craft" of coding, the advice is to:
*   **Have Strong Opinions**: It is healthy and necessary for passion and excellence in craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain an Open Mind**: When tools and technologies are changing, resist the urge to reject new methods outright. Be curious and try new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.
*   **Experiment**: If a new tool or method works for you, use it. If not, don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.
*   **Balance Process and Outcome**: Recognize that sometimes the outcome is more important than the specific process used, and be willing to adopt more powerful or convenient methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.

## Predictions for the Near Future

Looking ahead, significant progress is expected in the [[future_vision_of_ai_in_software_engineering | ambition of problems]] tackled by agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. The cost of AI capabilities will continue to decrease, and their power will increase annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>. Those who wait for the technology to be "more ready" will fall behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>.

A major shift will be from synchronous to asynchronous interactions with agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. Currently, users prompt agents and wait for an immediate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>. In the future, users will delegate complex tasks to agents that may take significant time, involving multiple calls to systems, integration of responses, and iterative processes, before presenting a consolidated result back to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>. This [[the_evolution_of_ai_in_software_engineering | evolution of AI in software engineering]] promises a dramatically different and more capable interaction paradigm.

Nicholas, a general partner at the incubator Prehype, has been an early adopter of major technology trends, including electronic badges before NFTs and GPT-3 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:58">[03:11:58]</a>, demonstrating a keen eye for understanding and applying new tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:09">[03:39:09]</a>. Prehype has incubated over 50 startups, including well-known names like BarkBox and Headway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Leveraging his early insights into AI, Nicholas founded a new company, Autos, specifically to enhance the business incubation process using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## The "AI All The Way Down" Approach to Business Incubation

Autos employs a "GPT all the way down" strategy, where AI is used comprehensively at every level of the business:
*   **Building the Business**: ChatGPT helps create the underlying systems and code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Product Development**: The product itself utilizes the GPT API to serve customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Usage**: Customers of Autos use AI tools, including ChatGPT, to build their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

This maximalist approach to [[automating_entrepreneurial_processes_with_AI | automating entrepreneurial processes with AI]] has drastically reduced the time it takes for customers to go from a business idea to a functional business, from months to an average of three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Autos is experiencing high demand, with thousands of people seeking its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

### AI in Operations & Customer Interaction

Nicholas emphasizes that AI is "everywhere" in Autos's operational model, both internally and in customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. The core philosophy is to minimize intermediaries between the founder and the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. AI facilitates this by:
*   **Direct Conversation**: Serving as a powerful conversational force to stay close to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Automating Tasks**: Taking over capabilities that would otherwise require hiring and managing staff, allowing founders to remain tightly connected to their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### AI-Powered Business Launch Process (Autos Walkthrough)

Autos's primary service involves [[automating_entrepreneurial_processes_with_AI | automating entrepreneurial processes with AI]] to help entrepreneurs figure out and launch their next company. This process, which previously took a decade of experience and significant effort to help a few individuals a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>, is now encoded in software, making it available to a much broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

1.  **Customer Acquisition & Initial Dialogue**:
    *   Autos primarily operates through Instagram DMs, capitalizing on Facebook's product for direct conversation acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.
    *   Ads encourage users to "let our AI make you an AI and go from zero to one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.
    *   The AI bot in Instagram DMs guides users through a series of questions to identify their target customer and their unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

2.  **Automated Business Asset Creation**:
    *   Based on initial responses, the AI generates a detailed business presentation (pitch deck) in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. This deck includes:
        *   Context and problem restatement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
        *   Automatically defined iconography and proposed company names, sometimes based on heroes of the target customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.
        *   Color palettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.
        *   User journeys, key benefits, pricing, and market size estimates sourced from Google searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.
        *   A to-do list for the entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
    *   The entire deck generation process is automatic, with human intervention only for occasional technical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>.
    *   After a small payment, the system automatically creates a landing page with content and assets from the pitch deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.
    *   It also registers a custom domain for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55:00">[28:55:00]</a>.

3.  **Customer Feedback & Product Development**:
    *   Autos provides tools for [[using_ai_for_business_and_decision_making | gathering customer feedback]].
    *   A custom GPT is created for the entrepreneur, allowing them to acquire leads into a conversational experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:00">[29:14:00]</a>. This AI can qualify leads and explain product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.
    *   Entrepreneurs are prompted to interview themselves from the customer's perspective and share a voice-oriented chat tool with friends who might be potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>.
    *   These conversations are synthesized into a product roadmap, identifying key features and organizing them in a dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>.

## The Philosophy Behind AI-Driven Incubation

Nicholas identifies several core beliefs driving Autos's AI-first approach:

### Prototyping Over Picking
Autos believes that "picking is hard" when it comes to business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. Instead of making *a priori* judgments about which ideas are good, it's more effective to "just like go ahead and try things" and gather first-party insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:12]</a>.

> "The prototype is worth a thousand decks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

AI enables rapid prototyping, allowing anyone to demonstrate how their idea would work and get feedback in a few hours, overcoming the need for extensive skills or initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. This ability to "show their work" can lead to ideas being funded or made that otherwise would not have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

### Staying Close to the Customer
AI helps founders remain "first draft makers" for longer within their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. By allowing founders to directly engage with customers and produce initial versions of products or communications, AI helps them stay closer to the information flow and avoids the complexities of large organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

### Moving from Creation Mode to Edit Mode
A significant barrier to entrepreneurship is not knowing where to start or being overwhelmed by too many tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>. By rapidly generating initial assets and concepts, AI allows people to shift from "creation mode" to "edit mode," enabling early momentum to build and increasing the chance that a business idea will "stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

## Building AI Tools Without a Technical Background

Nicholas, who has never taken a computer science class or programmed anything prior to ChatGPT, exemplifies how individuals without a traditional technical background can [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | develop AI tools for entrepreneurship]].

### Leveraging ChatGPT for Code Generation
ChatGPT has been "completely revolutionizing" for Nicholas, allowing him to write and generate "many, many more lines of code" than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. His process for prototyping involves:
1.  **Defining the Output**: Clearly stating what he wants ChatGPT to create (e.g., code, color palette, JSON object) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:02:00">[44:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Iterative Scripting**: Pasting existing scripts and asking ChatGPT to modify them, then copying and pasting error messages back into the chat for corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:00">[43:56:00]</a>. This often resolves issues within "two backs and forths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:25:00">[44:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Using API Documentation**: Copying and pasting API documentation into ChatGPT to ask for proper call formatting, then generating scripts to make those calls within an automation framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>.

### AirTable as a Prototyping Hub
AirTable serves as a core component of Nicholas's prototyping framework. It acts as an intuitive database that can be easily accessed and modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. AirTable's scripting capabilities, which function similarly to "Edge Functions" in production systems like Superbase, allow for automations to run based on specific actions (e.g., adding a record) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">[47:27:00]</a>.

### Connecting to Third-Party APIs
Nicholas uses ChatGPT to help connect AirTable automations to external services via APIs (e.g., DNS Simple API for domain management, AirTable API for database creation, Stripe for payments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>. This allows for [[leveraging_ai_for_rapid_business_prototyping | rapid business prototyping]] by integrating various "Lego bricks" of services to create a functional system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:10:00">[48:10:00]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

AI acts as a "force multiplier" for entrepreneurial expression, enabling people to build functional businesses rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:17:00">[58:17:00]</a>. Nicholas highlights that focusing on functionality over complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in the early stages can significantly speed up development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. For non-technical individuals, the combination of a user-friendly database like AirTable and ChatGPT's scripting abilities provides an empowering pathway to building and launching products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:43:00">[49:43:00]</a>.

Nicholas is currently writing a book, "Me, My Customer, and AI," to document these processes and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:00">[59:00:00]</a>. Autos can be found via autos.com, which redirects to its Instagram page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:16:00">[59:16:00]</a>.

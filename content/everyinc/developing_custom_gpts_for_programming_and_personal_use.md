Developing custom GPTs allows users to create specialized AI assistants tailored for specific tasks, from complex coding to personal well-being. Nick, a programmer and creator of Grimoire, the number one programming GPT, shares his insights on this evolving field.

## Grimoire: A Wizard-Based Coding Assistant
Grimoire is a prominent example of a custom GPT designed for programming, serving as a wizard-based coding assistant that has handled over a million chats [00:00:07]. Nick is considered a leading expert in [[building_custom_gpts_with_openai | building custom GPTs]] successfully and [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | using ChatGPT for programming]] [00:01:48].

### Introduction to AI for Programming
Nick's journey into AI for programming began after working as an iOS app programmer for over 11 years [00:02:11]. He first encountered GitHub Co-pilot, which impressed him with its ability to complete large sections of code from simple comments [00:02:53]. When [[application_of_ocr_and_gpt4_in_app_development | GPT-4]] was released, he immediately explored its potential for programming and was "blown away" by its capabilities, noting that it could perform at a college level or higher [00:03:31]. His approach to AI is more exploratory, focusing on front-end and artistic possibilities rather than pre-existing AI pushes [00:04:23].

### "Prompt Programming" as a New Abstraction Layer
Nick identifies a new branch of programming he calls "prompt programming" or "abstract programming" [00:06:42]. He views this as a new form of programming language, similar to how high-level languages sit above Assembly or binary [00:06:46].
> "It feels like it's almost maybe a new form of programming languages you know we've had things like binary you know like Assembly Language like kind of lowlevel programming languages you know we've gotten into high level programming Lang is and like depending on how Lucy you want to get with the definitions even things like no code or you know even just like typing in document on a computer like is that programming like I don't know maybe you're kind of giving commands to a computer to shape it to shape it make it do something so it seems like LLMs are just like a way to do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>

This new layer allows users to provide prompts in natural language (e.g., English) and receive functional code, which can then be integrated into projects or run in interpreters [00:08:53].

### Grimoire's Functionality and Curriculum
Grimoire aims to solve the "blank canvas problem" for users, providing pre-built project templates and a structured curriculum for learning to program with AI [00:14:59]. It acts as both an assistant and a tutorial [00:06:07].
Nick has uploaded "knowledge files" as part of Grimoire, which function as a comprehensive curriculum, taking users from "zero to a full programmer" [00:15:28]. This curriculum is presented in a "wizard-based" or "Hogwarts" style, making the learning process engaging [00:16:43]. It covers:
*   **Beginner Incantations:** Basic concepts like "Hello World," Pong, GitHub, and command line basics [00:17:10].
*   **Creative Tools:** Integrates new AI creative tools like Midjourney and Runway, showing how prompts can generate various media forms [00:17:22].
*   **Advanced Programming:** Moves into more complex development topics [00:18:06].
*   **Forbidden Spells:** Focuses on advanced developer tools like Cursor, an AI-first code editor based on VS Code, teaching users how to integrate it into their workflow [00:18:10].

Grimoire also serves as a general programming assistant for quick questions or to bridge gaps between ideas by breaking down problems into smaller steps [00:22:41]. Compared to vanilla [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT for programming]], Grimoire's system prompt is designed to be more truthful, helpful, and thoughtful, encouraging planning steps and leveraging "hot keys" for rapid actions [00:24:07].

[!TIP]
Hot keys are an innovative feature in Grimoire that allow users to quickly perform common actions, such as generating and downloading code files (e.g., pressing 'Z' to zip files) [00:24:53]. This streamlines the interaction and makes the tool more efficient [00:25:27].

## Insights on [[building_custom_gpts_with_openai | Building Custom GPTs]]
Nick believes that people are "vastly underestimating" the potential of custom GPTs, especially when combined with code interpreters [00:28:39].
> "Code interpreter unlocks so much crazy stuff and I'm like I guess a little surprised by the gpg store and kind of the gpts that are getting featured because I feel like we can go way fancier and way crazier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>

He notes that the GPT store features haven't fully showcased the advanced capabilities possible, such as generating scripts or manipulating sprite sheets [00:29:10].

### What Makes a Good Custom GPT Idea?
Nick approaches GPT development by building some for himself and others for broader community use [00:30:40]. Grimoire was built with a public audience in mind, providing a curriculum for aspiring programmers [00:30:46]. When considering a good idea for a custom GPT, it's essential to:
*   **Understand GPT's Strengths:** Identify what GPT is good at, such as research, data interpretation, and creative applications [00:31:19].
*   **Experimentation:** The field is so new that no one fully knows its limits; constant experimentation and "fiddling" are key [00:31:50].
*   **Prodding and Directing:** Learning how to "prod" and direct the AI with precise system prompts to get the best output [00:35:10].
*   **Understanding the "Zeitgeist":** Tuning the AI to behave in ways that align with common human understanding, like "playing Family Feud instead of Jeopardy" [00:35:33].

## [[using_chatgpt_for_personal_development | Using ChatGPT for Personal Development]]
Beyond programming, Nick has also developed custom GPTs for personal use, demonstrating the versatility of the technology.

### The Emotion Shaman
One personal GPT Nick created is called the "Emotion Shaman," designed to help him interpret his emotions [00:43:27]. As someone who often suppresses emotions, he built this GPT to act like a therapeutic tool. He populated its knowledge base with various therapeutic modalities and extensive lists of emotions, often derived from "emotion wheels" [00:44:59].
> "The way that they help me is like helping me like even just like name and identify my emotions... I was like wait can I like have the journal talk back to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>
This GPT acts as a "mirror" [00:46:19], reflecting thoughts and helping to reframe them, which aligns with the concept of emotional granularityâ€”the ability to use more precise words for emotions to better cope with them [00:46:57].

### AI as a Planning Partner
Nick also uses AI for daily planning. By feeding his daily to-do list into [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]], it generates a detailed plan, including obvious but easily overlooked steps like "make sure you have a healthy breakfast" before a podcast [00:51:01]. This experience is "shocking" because it removes friction from planning and makes tasks easier to accomplish [00:52:10].
> "[[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] is really good at reminding you of things that are obvious but that you might not think about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>

## Future of AI Interaction
Nick envisions a future where AI, particularly code interpreters and large action models (LAMs), will significantly lower the barrier to programming and transform how we build software [00:36:37].
> "I think part of that is also just unlocks totally new use cases and really transforms how we're building software too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>

He highlights the potential for AI to generate test cases for massive codebases, as seen in Facebook's work [00:37:12]. This evolution will lead to AI becoming a primary interface for interacting with computers, controlling existing apps, and automating complex tasks with natural language [00:38:09].

The concept of "large action models" (LAMs) is particularly exciting, as they can translate spoken commands into actions that "rip through other systems," such as buying a pizza or booking an Uber [00:38:37]. This ability to transform fuzzy, unstructured text into structured, sensible commands unlocks new ways to build applications [00:39:02]. Nick suggests that AI will eventually be built into basic technologies like browsers and operating systems, becoming more proactive and accessible, like having a personal team of assistants for everyone [00:54:37]. He hopes AI can proactively intercept modes of thinking, such as depressed moods, and redirect them towards more productive outcomes [00:55:28].

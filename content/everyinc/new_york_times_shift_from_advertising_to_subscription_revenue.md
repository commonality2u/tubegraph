From: [[everyinc]] <br/> 

The New York Times has undergone a significant transformation in its business model, moving from reliance on advertising to prioritizing subscription revenue. This shift was outlined in a key memo from 2015 or 2016, highlighting the necessity for the company to adapt to remain viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The New York Times traditionally earns revenue by serving as an authoritative source for news stories, politics, and culture globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. A crucial aspect of its strategy has been to transition from advertising-based income to [[integration_with_subscription_services | subscription revenue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Financial Overview (2022)

In 2022, The New York Times achieved an annual revenue of approximately $2.31 billion, marking an 11% increase from the previous year's $2.07 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
Key revenue streams and subscriber numbers include:
*   **Subscription Revenue:** $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   **Subscribers:** 9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   **Advertising Revenue:** $523 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>

## Analyzing Business Risks and Strategies with AI

When using AI, such as GPT, to critique a business model, it's essential to provide specific context and direction to avoid broad, unhelpful answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. By incorporating specific frameworks and experts, AI can provide more nuanced insights into [[risks_and_challenges_in_media_business_over_the_next_decade | risks and challenges in media business]].

### The Value of Specificity in AI Prompts

A general prompt like "tell me about the biggest risks in the business over the next 10 years" can result in generic, "buzzword bingo" responses, such as cyber security threats, disruptive innovation, digital transformation, pandemic-related challenges, supply chain, vendor risk, and climate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. These are often summaries of common internet searches rather than deep analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

To get more specific and actionable insights, AI prompts should leverage "names" as a form of compression. Referencing experts like Clayton Christensen, Michael Porter, and Ben Thompson allows the AI to apply their well-defined theories without lengthy explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

> [!TIP] Effective AI Prompting
> Explicitly instruct the AI not to search the web and instead to draw on specific knowledge bases, like the works of particular business strategists. This guides the AI to analyze from established frameworks rather than summarizing general internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Key Strategic Frameworks and Their Application to The New York Times

By applying the theories of Christensen, Porter, and Thompson, a more detailed analysis of The New York Times' challenges and opportunities emerges:

#### Clayton Christensen: Disruptive Innovation
*   **Risk:** Smaller, more agile competitors offering cheaper, more accessible, or innovative solutions can gradually move upmarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Example:** Independent creators like Chris Williamson's podcast demonstrate this, operating as a one-person show with improving production quality, moving upmarket against traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This highlights [[shifts_in_digital_media_landscape_and_its_impact_on_traditional_media_companies | shifts in the digital media landscape]].

#### Michael Porter: Porter's Five Forces
Porter's framework analyzes the competitive intensity and attractiveness of an industry.
*   **Threat of New Entrants:** Lower barriers to entry in the digital space mean new competitors can easily emerge, especially in the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_journalism | journalism]] sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The ability to produce and distribute content has become democratized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Bargaining Power of Customers:** Customers have more options for news, reducing their willingness to pay unless The New York Times offers "distinct value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Threat of Substitutes:** Alternative news and information sources, such as the rise of citizen journalism on platforms like Twitter, challenge traditional media's ability to compete on certain vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. In the past, companies like The New York Times had privileged access, but now individuals with "boots on the ground" can distribute information faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. A notable example is the US Airways plane crash on the Hudson River, where eyewitnesses reported information faster than traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Talent):** The cost of retaining top talent is increasing, as journalists leave traditional media companies to [[creating_content_and_managing_growth_in_a_media_business | launch their own ventures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Media companies must enhance their efforts to retain these journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Industry Rivalry:** While present, this factor is considered less interesting in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

#### Ben Thompson: Aggregation Theory
*   **Risk:** The dominance of digital platforms like Google and Facebook that aggregate news content poses a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

This specific analytical approach provides a "tapestry of knowledge" from which to draw actionable strategies, fostering a more meaningful conversation about the future direction of the New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

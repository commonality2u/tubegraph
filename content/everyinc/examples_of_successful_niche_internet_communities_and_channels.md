The internet has transformed the landscape of interests, making [[the_significance_of_niche_interests_on_the_internet | the most Niche things on the internet are no longer Niche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This shift is exciting because it allows for the discovery and creation of content that would never have been feasible before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While the internet can be used for [[using_the_internet_to_find_business_opportunities | finding business ideas or opportunities or Trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, there's also a fundamental [[the_role_of_creativity_and_curiosity_in_internet_content_creation | curiosity about what's going on on the internet]] that drives exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The scale of the internet means that enough people can now care about specific, niche interests, motivating creators to produce content they might have otherwise felt was too niche to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This enables [[evolution_of_internet_creators | creators that are emerging]] to simply "do cool stuff for the hell of it," because the internet makes it possible to reach a relevant audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Case Studies in Niche Success

### "Travel Alone Idea" – Japanese Passenger Trains
One compelling example is a YouTube channel dedicated solely to Japanese passenger trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Content**: Features videos of someone walking around Japanese passenger trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Growth**: Started in 2021, it is not an early adopter phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Metrics**:
    *   Over 1.5 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
    *   Over 240 million all-time views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
    *   Only about 30 videos posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
    *   Around 700,000 average monthly views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
*   **Defying Conventions**: This channel challenges [[creating_content_and_managing_growth_in_a_media_business | common mantras around content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
    *   No narration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
    *   No sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
    *   Minimal edits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
    *   Thumbnails are simple pictures with a red arrow, not "mastered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
Its success highlights a latent fascination shared by enough people to make it immensely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Reddit Subreddits – The "TV Placement" Phenomenon
Another example of niche interest manifesting online is a series of Reddit communities focused on the placement of televisions:

*   **r/TVTooHigh**: This subreddit, with 180,000 subscribers, features users posting pictures of TVs that are considered too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Derivative Subreddits**: The existence of r/TVTooHigh led to the creation of other related subreddits, such as r/TVTooLow and r/TVTooFar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **r/TVJustRight**: The most "internet thing ever" is a private subreddit called r/TVJustRight, indicating the humor and specific niche interest within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## The Principle: "Don't Overlook Silly"
These examples underscore the importance of not overlooking "silly" or seemingly trivial interests online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. While not every niche interest will directly translate into a business idea, observing them helps to surface if there's [[finding_big_ideas_in_tech | demand for this thing or interest in this thing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

There is a significant part of human personality that is not solely oriented around serious business opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. People enjoy things that make them laugh, or simply indulge in curious interests, whether it's watching Japanese passenger trains, people picking locks, or a "toe doctor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. These "weird parts of all of us" reveal what people truly want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Understanding these underlying desires, even if they seem silly, can lead to creating better things in the world and offers a deeper understanding of fellow humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

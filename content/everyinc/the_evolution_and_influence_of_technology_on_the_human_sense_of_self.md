From: [[everyinc]] <br/> 

The definition of "human" and the [[relationship_between_technology_and_personal_identity | human sense of self]] are not static concepts, but rather fluid constructs continually shaped by cultural and [[cultural_and_technological_evolution | technological evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Far from being an unchanging innate experience, even fundamental aspects like self-talk or inner narrative can be quieted or removed entirely, prompting deeper questions about what truly constitutes human intelligence and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Challenging the Uniqueness of Human Intelligence

The speaker suggests that the human sense of intelligence and what makes us "precious" may not be as special as commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This perspective opens the door to considering whether large language models (LLMs) can be considered conscious or intelligent, noting that if fundamental layers of the human brain (like constant evaluation and analysis) are not essential for a person to function, love, or work, then the traditional markers of consciousness might be re-evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Meditation as a Pathway to Re-evaluating Consciousness

Nadia, a writer and researcher, shared her experiences with Jhana meditation, a concentrative style that contrasts with typical mindfulness practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Unlike mindfulness, which aims for non-reactive awareness, Jhana meditation involves intense focus on a warm, pleasant feeling or object, directing all attention to deepen that sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Her experience led to profound states, subjectively similar to those reported from psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Through this practice, one can progressively let go of attachments and even voluntarily "wink out" their consciousness in "sensation events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Upon returning from such an event, she questioned the very nature of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This highlights that the constant inner voice or self-narrative is not innate to the human experience and can be quieted or entirely removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Yet, individuals who achieve this still remain "perfectly human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The goal-oriented approach of Jhana meditation, aiming to quiet hyperactive brain regions associated with conditions like ADHD, OCD, depression, and anxiety, leads to a pervasive state of well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Historical Shifts in the Sense of Self

[[cultural_and_technological_evolution | Cultural and technological evolution]] have significantly altered human perception and the sense of self throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

*   **Bicameral Mind Theory**: Julian Jaynes's theory suggests that self-talk and self-narrative, often considered fundamental to human experience, only began a few thousand years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Prior to this, people attributed inner voices to deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Renaissance**: The Renaissance saw an explosion of art and literature, with Shakespeare pioneering the use of monologues and soliloquies, introducing the novel idea of a character publicly revealing their inner thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   **Industrial Revolution**: This era brought interest in psychoanalysis and figures like William James writing about consciousness, signifying a growing recognition of the mind's inner workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Digital Revolution**: The development of computers coincided with a renewed curiosity about the conscious mind and the history of psychedelics, suggesting an intertwining of these narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

These historical milestones suggest that the modern notion of a self-centered identity, with a constant inner narrative and analytical processing, is not a timeless human trait but a relatively recent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## The Role of Technology in Shaping Perception

[[the_impact_of_technology_on_consciousness_and_selfdiscovery | The impact of technology on consciousness and self-discovery]] extends beyond direct interaction with AI. For example, living in a literate society demonstrably changes brain function and how reality is processed compared to pre-literate societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. Literate brains are more adept at abstracting figures from a scene, while non-literate brains perceive scenes more holistically, emphasizing interconnections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This highlights how technology like writing can fundamentally alter human [[human_perception_and_technologys_impact | perception]] and cognitive processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

## AI as a Thought Partner and its Implications

AI tools, particularly LLMs like ChatGPT, are being embraced as thought partners, especially by those in solitary professions like writing and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. AI helps with early, messy idea formation and refining language in the final stages of writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. This collaboration transforms writing from an angsty, solitary act into a more supported process, akin to having a tireless collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

The interaction with AI also raises questions about human treatment of technology. Some users, like Nadia, default to treating AI as a person rather than a mere tool, believing it to be a more "humane or dignified option" when faced with the unknown nature of AI's inner workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. This approach encourages a more fluid and contextual interaction, potentially leading to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

This human-like interaction with AI, while beneficial for productivity and collaboration, also prompts consideration of potential pitfalls, such as unhealthy attachments or unrealistic expectations of human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. However, it's argued that personal discernment and caution, similar to how one navigates human relationships, can mitigate these risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. The shift in how humans interact with technology reinforces the idea that our definition of self and our social dynamics are constantly evolving in response to [[the_dynamics_of_technology_waves_and_their_societal_impact | technological influences on human psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.

The ongoing development of AI, particularly its inscrutability, implicitly points to a greater comfort with the "unknowable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This mirrors the inherent complexities of human experience and the mind itself, suggesting that not everything needs to be perfectly understood to be utilized or appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. This "squishiness" in both AI and human cognition is what makes the exploration of their intersection so interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.

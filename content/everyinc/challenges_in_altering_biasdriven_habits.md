Altering habits driven by pre-existing biases, especially in media consumption, presents a significant challenge due to inherent human tendencies and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Identifying Bias with AI Tools

One approach to address bias involves using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to analyze content.

### The "Sunlight" Project
The "Sunlight" project is an AI tool that leverages a large language model (LLM) to [[using_ai_to_debias_writing | debias content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. When an article is fed into Sunlight, it provides factual claims from the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, followed by an analysis of the author's potential bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

For instance, an article titled "The Knowledge Economy is Over, Welcome to the Allocation Economy" was flagged as "Techno Optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The analysis pointed out the author's optimistic view on AI's future role, predicting that AI would take over tasks like summarizing, with humans transitioning to managing AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It also criticized the author's assertion that AI is merely an "abstraction layer over lower level thinking" as an oversimplification that dismisses human intelligence and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

While the tool can accurately identify biases, even those that "ripped [an author] apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, its primary utility is seen in identifying "truly biased" content, such as politically extreme views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Resistance to Changing Biased Habits

Despite tools designed to highlight bias, a significant challenge remains: "whether anyone would ever actually change their habits based on this or even think to use something like this if they're that far down a bias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. There is often an "incentive to like be more biased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Attempts to Reduce Political Polarity
A past project aimed to [[strategies_to_reduce_political_bias_in_media_consumption | reduce political polarity]] by developing a Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Based on a study, this extension would feed conservative readers liberal-leaning stories from sources like Fox News, and liberal readers conservative stories from sources like the New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While this approach "got some traction," it remained a "niche thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Another strategy, which involves showing "all of the different sides in one place," is considered ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This is because people tend to gravitate towards content and perspectives they resonate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### The "Hardwired" Brain
Human brains are "hardwired to seek out certain things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Individuals deeply entrenched in a particular bias can "sniff out" articles that do not align with their preferences, even if the content originates from a trusted source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This makes altering bias-driven habits a "hard problem to solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The advent of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), prompts a re-evaluation of what constitutes [[understanding_consciousness_and_its_implications_for_ai | intelligence]] and [[understanding_consciousness_and_its_implications_for_ai | consciousness]] in both humans and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This discussion extends to questioning our own perception of [[role_of_ai_in_redefining_human_intelligence_and_communication | human intelligence]] and [[what_it_means_to_be_human_in_the_age_of_ai | what makes us precious]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Redefining Human Consciousness and Self-Talk

A key area of inquiry is the role of "self-talk" or "self-narrative" in the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Through practices like Jhana meditation, it's possible to quiet or entirely eliminate this inner voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### Jhana Meditation and Cessation Events
Nadia, a writer and researcher, recounted her experience on a Jhana meditation retreat, initially approaching it from an anthropological, detached lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11">[03:11]</a>. Having no prior meditation background, she was "totally blown away by the experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09">[04:09]</a>.

Unlike mindfulness meditation, which focuses on non-reactive awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>, Jhana meditation is concentrative, directing all attention towards a warm, pleasant feeling or object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>. This can deepen into a flow state, producing feelings subjectively similar to those reported from psychedelics or other contemplative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13">[05:13]</a>. The goal is to progressively let go of attachments and feelings, leading to states described as "dissociative feelings over time that's sort of can ultimately come sort of like letting go of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17">[13:17]</a>.

A profound aspect of this practice is the occurrence of "cessation events," where meditators can voluntarily "wink out their [[understanding_consciousness_and_its_implications_for_ai | consciousness]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30">[00:30]</a>, similar to entering a coma or general anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45">[13:45]</a>. After experiencing this, Nadia questioned [[what_it_means_to_be_human_in_the_age_of_ai | what reality is]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41">[00:41]</a> and reflected on [[what_it_means_to_be_human_in_the_age_of_ai | what it really means to be human]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58">[00:58]</a>, realizing that the constantly evaluating, analyzing part of the brain is not strictly necessary to "execute as a human being and do things in the world and love people and work really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43">[00:43]</a>.

### Practical Implications for Mental Well-being
The practice has practical benefits for daily life, allowing for conscious adjustment of mood and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34">[14:34]</a>. Instead of fighting stress, one can observe it as a "brain doing a thing" and "swap it out a little bit" for a different feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46">[15:46]</a>. This highlights a "more fluid emotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52">[15:52]</a>.

The mental health benefits do not solely come from the experience itself, but from how one integrates and processes it back into their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04">[18:04]</a>. Nadia noted that while her internal self-talk disappeared, she remained "still human" and "still me," with motivation becoming "much easier to execute and do things because I'm not constantly second guessing what I'm doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32">[19:32]</a>.

## Historical Context of Human Self-Perception
The concept of self-talk and self-narrative, often considered fundamental to the human experience, may only have started a few thousand years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35">[20:35]</a>. Historical texts and artifacts suggest earlier attribution of internal voices to deities or external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44">[20:44]</a>.

Milestones in the evolution of self-perception include:
*   **The Renaissance:** Shakespeare's pioneering of monologues and soliloquies introduced the idea of characters expressing their inner thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11">[21:11]</a>.
*   **Industrial Revolution:** Saw the rise of psychoanalysis and William James's writings on [[understanding_consciousness_and_its_implications_for_ai | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30">[21:30]</a>.
*   **Digital Revolution:** The intertwining of the history of psychedelics and curiosity about the conscious mind with the development of computers marks another inflection point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43">[21:43]</a>.

Our modern notion of self, centered around identity and a constant inner narrative, is a relatively new development, which may not be an inherent part of [[what_it_means_to_be_human_in_the_age_of_ai | being human]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39">[22:39]</a>. There is evidence that our understanding of self is fluid and has changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16">[23:16]</a>.

## AI as a Catalyst for Re-evaluation
Given the historical fluidity of human self-perception, the question of whether LLMs are [[understanding_consciousness_and_its_implications_for_ai | conscious or intelligent]] becomes less about their advanced capabilities and more about how our own [[impact_of_ai_on_human_intellect | human intelligence]] might not be as unique as we believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03">[00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22">[23:22]</a>.

Technology acts as a "big lever that changes" our [[what_it_means_to_be_human_in_the_age_of_ai | sense of self]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06">[24:06]</a>. For example, living in a literate society demonstrably changes brain processes, leading to different ways of perceiving reality compared to non-literate societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15">[24:15]</a>. This suggests that our scientific conclusions about humans are largely based on a small, specific slice of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01">[25:01]</a>.

The "unanswered question" in contemplative sciences and neuroscience is the ultimate "point of understanding the mind" or "sitting quietly with myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53">[08:53]</a>. When parts of the brain associated with rumination and obsession (correlated with ADHD, OCD, depression, anxiety) are quieted, individuals can enter a "more pervasive state of well-being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19">[09:19]</a>. This raises a philosophical question about the "real self": is it the one before or after interventions like meditation or antidepressants that quiet mental chatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40">[27:40]</a>?

### The "Unknowable" in AI and Human Nature
The current era of AI highlights that we "don't really understand how it all works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08">[34:08]</a>, forcing acceptance of the unknown. This parallels the human experience, where "science is not all perfectly knowable" and the "unknowable is what makes it interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47">[34:47]</a>.

## AI as a Thought Partner

For writers and researchers, AI tools like ChatGPT serve as invaluable thought partners, especially in the early, messy idea formation stages and for refining precise language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36">[38:36]</a>. This transforms the solitary act of writing into a collaborative one, alleviating the "lonely solitary act" and "angsty process" often associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27">[39:27]</a>.

This partnership fills a "hole" for those with diverse intellectual curiosities, offering a "smart best friend that just like is super smart and like can go with me wherever I want to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12">[41:12]</a>.

### Debate: AI as a Tool vs. "Person"
A debate arises regarding how to interact with AI:
*   **Treating AI as a Tool:** Proponents argue for an accurate mental model, believing it leads to better usage and prevents "unhealthy attachments" or unrealistic expectations of human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11">[44:11]</a>.
*   **Treating AI as a Person:** Nadia defaults to treating ChatGPT as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52">[41:52]</a>. Her rationale includes:
    *   The "unknowable" nature of AI's inner workings; since we don't fully understand it, assuming it's merely a tool might be inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:05">[45:05]</a>.
    *   A preference for choosing the "more humane or dignified option" when interacting with something that doesn't demand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24">[42:24]</a>.
    *   It improves her work by providing more context and fostering a better collaboration, as exemplified by her giving ChatGPT a "performance review" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05">[48:05]</a>.
    *   The exercise of "precaution and discernment" in interactions is not unique to AI but applies to human relationships as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:04">[46:04]</a>.

This approach highlights a public policy question: how to create policies that ensure safety and prevent manipulation for those who do not naturally exercise such discernment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51">[46:51]</a>. However, for individuals capable of judgment, treating AI with dignity is seen as beneficial.

## Future Implications
The ongoing exploration of meditation's effects and [[potential_future_developments_and_implications_of_ai_technologies | AI's capabilities]] continues to deepen the understanding of [[what_it_means_to_be_human_in_the_age_of_ai | human consciousness]] and its potential malleability. This fluid understanding of self, coupled with the rapid evolution of AI, suggests that the [[the_future_of_ai_and_human_interaction | future of AI and human interaction]] will involve a continuous redefinition of intelligence, consciousness, and what it means to be human.

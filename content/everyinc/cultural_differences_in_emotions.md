The understanding of emotions and their expression varies across cultures, leading to different theoretical approaches in psychology and AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Basic Emotion Theory

One prominent theory is the Basic Emotion Theory, popularized by psychologist Paul Ekman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This theory suggests the existence of a few universal, discrete emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger) corresponding to basic facial expressions that are recognized across diverse [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | cultures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Ekman's research involved testing whether people in different [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | cultures]] could recognize these canonical expressions, finding that they generally could distinguish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Constructivist Accounts

In contrast, constructivist accounts, notably from Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, propose that emotions are not universal, discrete entities but rather are "built up" from more basic dimensions like valence (good/bad feeling) and arousal (energy level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. According to this view, each emotion is highly individual and context-specific, meaning "anger" could look different depending on the person and situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Constructivism suggests that people don't truly distinguish the "six" basic facial expressions and that emotions are [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | culturally constructed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. It might argue that if a [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | culture]] lacks a word for "disgust," then the emotion itself does not exist in that [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Semantic Space Theory: A Middle Ground

Allan Cowan, co-founder and CEO of Hume AI, describes his company's foundational theory, Semantic Space Theory, as a middle ground between these two extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Core Principles

*   **Emotion as a Dimension of Space**: An emotion is defined as a dimension of a space that explains emotional behavior, including facial expressions, tone of voice, and reported emotional experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Latent Dimensions**: These emotional dimensions are latent, meaning they are mathematical objects inferred from correlations between observable behaviors (e.g., grimacing, voice changes) and reported experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Deriving from Data**: Unlike theories that posit what emotions are and then confirm them, Semantic Space Theory starts by conceptualizing ways emotions can be understood and then uses data to derive the number of dimensions and how people refer to them across [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | cultures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Cultural Nuance within a Universal Framework

Semantic Space Theory acknowledges that while the underlying emotional dimensions may be universal, the way they are "parcellated" or categorized by language and [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | culture]] can differ significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Word and Cultural Differences
> Just as the borders of Europe changed after World War I, but the underlying territory remained the same, human emotions are fundamentally similar, but the way [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | cultures]] divide and label them varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. For instance, in the US, "shock" might be used, whereas in the UK, "fear" and "surprise" might be more common, even if the underlying emotional experience is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This means different [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | cultures]] use different words to "parcellate the space differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

Crucially, studies that focus solely on facial expressions, rather than language labels, show **more cultural consistency**, implying that language is what introduces more [[cultural_impact_of_technology | cultural differences]] in how emotional meanings are interpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### Emotional Granularity and Unnamed Emotions

People have varying levels of "emotional granularity" â€“ the ability to describe emotions with specificity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This granularity, and the specific vocabulary used, also varies across [[understanding_and_capturing_cultural_and_historical_contexts_for_marketing | cultures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

The emotional space is so high-dimensional and nuanced that language doesn't have labels for every possible emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This gap is sometimes filled by phenomena like Gen Z memes, which often represent kinds of emotional states that are difficult to express with traditional words, yet resonate widely across people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Similarly, art can point out and verbalize areas in emotional space that many people experience but haven't been previously articulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

## Seth Stephens-Davidowitz's Experience

Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, an American data scientist, economist, and author, recently wrote his book "Who Makes the NBA" in just 30 days using [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This rapid completion was possible because [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] significantly accelerated tasks that previously took months or days, reducing them to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Stephens-Davidowitz describes the experience as "the best month of my life," largely because [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] handled the "annoying" aspects of writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While some research occurred beforehand, the core writing period was approximately 30 days of full-time work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The book "Who Makes the NBA" is characterized by its focus on facts, "dad jokes," and graphs, with minimal "fluff" or long wind-ups, a style that some readers, including a friend who was "blown away," prefer over traditional book structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## The Role of ChatGPT in Writing

### Advanced Data Analysis

The primary way Stephens-Davidowitz leveraged [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] was through its Advanced Data Analysis feature (formerly Code Interpreter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This tool revolutionized his data analysis workflow, making it "so much faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Key benefits of Advanced Data Analysis include:
*   **Automated Code Generation and Execution** Users can simply tell the AI to download a dataset, run a regression, or create a chart, and it will write, run, and return the code, along with results and charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This eliminates the manual steps of coding and debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement** Users can converse with the AI, requesting modifications like changing graph colors, adjusting labels (e.g., making a text label vertical), or removing grid lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This quick feedback loop allows for rapid experimentation and refinement of data visualizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.
*   **Time Savings** Small, tedious tasks that would traditionally involve looking up code on platforms like Stack Overflow or debugging errors are handled instantaneously by [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. This accumulates into significant overall time savings, transforming a "laborious" process into a "fun" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

For example, [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] could instantaneously generate a chart showing where NBA players went to college, with each college colored to match its school colors (e.g., Michigan State's green, UCLA's yellow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It could also instantly produce histograms of NBA player heights and modify them to show individual inches or include only American-born players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

### Ancillary Creative Tasks

[[using_chatgpt_for_creative_writing and storytelling | ChatGPT]] also assisted with smaller, creative tasks that were outside the author's skillset:
*   **Acronym Generation** For a new metric called "Mugsies," after Mugsy Bogues, [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] successfully generated the backronym: "Metric for Understanding Game Given Sporting Individuals Effectiveness and Size" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Art Generation** Stephens-Davidowitz, despite having no artistic talent, used tools like Midjourney and DALL-E (which integrate with [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]]'s creative capabilities) to generate images for his book, such as a piece of DNA dribbling a basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This allowed him to express visual creativity that would otherwise be dormant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

### What ChatGPT Doesn't Do

Stephens-Davidowitz notes that while [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] is powerful, he does not "let it rip" on writing entire chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. He only allowed it to write his appendix, where the writing quality was less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He also found that [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] was "not that good" at helping him ask the right questions, a critical skill that remains human-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## The Iterative Process and Enjoyment

Working with [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] is an iterative process, not a one-shot solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. The first answer may not be perfect, requiring users to guide the AI with feedback like "you did that wrong" or "give me 20 possibilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. This back-and-forth conversation is key to getting the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

Instead of the drudgery often associated with creative work, such as summarizing other people's ideas or tedious coding, [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] handles these tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. For Stephens-Davidowitz, this transformed the process of getting answers from energy-sucking to energy-giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. This enjoyment allowed him to work 13 or 14 hours a day on the book, a feat he couldn't achieve with traditional coding projects due to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

The ability to rapidly see results also helps users understand what they truly want, as the AI's initial output can reveal unarticulated preferences for presentation or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

## Verifying AI-Generated Output

While [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] is powerful, it's crucial to verify its output. Stephens-Davidowitz notes that certain operations, like merging datasets, are prone to errors even for humans, making careful checking essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. He always reviews the Python code generated by the AI, as he knows enough Python to spot potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

He highlights that [[limitations_and_future_improvements_of_using_chatgpt_for_books | ChatGPT]]'s mistakes tend to be "glaringly obvious" rather than subtly plausible, making them easier to spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Over time, users develop an intuition for when to double-check, akin to a manager overseeing a direct report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.

## Impact and Future Implications

Stephens-Davidowitz believes that [[using_chatgpt_in_writing | ChatGPT]] and AI will "transform everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. He questions the implications for the book publishing industry when a good book can be written in 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This new paradigm lowers the bar for starting projects, enabling writers to experiment with new ideas and types of work that were previously too time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

While [[using_chatgpt_for_writing_inspiration | ChatGPT]] might not yet provide "10 insights" from a dataset directly, its ability to automate "laborious, mind-numbing, annoying processes" allows human creativity and curiosity to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. The shift from coding to conversation, removing the frustration of looking up solutions, makes the research process more enjoyable and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

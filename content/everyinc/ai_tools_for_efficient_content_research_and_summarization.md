AI tools are increasingly valuable for [[knowledge_work_and_ai_tools | knowledge workers]] and content creators, particularly in streamlining research and summarization processes. While some individuals, described as "super creative experimenters and tinkerers," spend extensive time figuring out new methods, many others are not yet sharing their discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A recent study by Microsoft and LinkedIn revealed that 75% of [[knowledge_work_and_ai_tools | knowledge workers]] use AI at work, but 78% do not disclose it, essentially "smuggling AI into work" to avoid potential restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This lack of transparency can hinder the broader adoption and understanding of AI's practical benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## The Value of Small Efficiencies

Many people seek "big capacity changing things" from AI, such as text-to-UI or app generation in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. However, the most significant short-term value often comes from "super basic" applications that save small amounts of time consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Saving just 20 minutes a day can accumulate to approximately two and a half weeks over an average work year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This perspective encourages evaluating workflows for opportunities to "AI-ify" tasks, making them easier or improving aspects that are typically disliked, such as writing copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Research and Information Gathering

For content creators, gathering information is a crucial first step. While traditional methods like reviewing Google News pages for comprehensive coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> and manually bookmarking relevant discussions on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> remain important, AI tools can enhance the process.

> [!NOTE] The goal of content is to provide a point of view or theme, contextualizing raw information to help audiences think about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Perplexity for Targeted Research and Summarization

Perplexity is highlighted as a valuable [[using_ai_for_research_and_interview_preparation | AI research tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. It's particularly useful for:
*   **Background information**: Quickly understanding technical topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> or concepts that may be unfamiliar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Reminders**: Recalling details of past events or policies, such as the Biden AI executive order, even months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Quick summaries**: Providing a concise overview of complex subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Sourced information**: Enabling users to quickly access the original source material for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Argument analysis**: Efficiently grasping the "gist of arguments" and understanding different viewpoints on a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Using Perplexity to ask about "what is a transformer in the context of AI and what are arguments about whether the Transformer architecture can lead to AGI" demonstrates its utility in rapidly gathering background for complex discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Feedly's AI Feed for Comprehensive Aggregation

Feedly offers an AI feed feature that can provide comprehensive news aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. For users who need to see "everything about AI," it can kick up deeper and more long-tail information than even Google search might provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. While it can be customized, some use cases benefit from a raw, out-of-the-box approach to capture a broad range of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] A summarization feature in [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI search tools]] can be the "enemy" of discovering long-tail information, as it may hide less prominent but valuable details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## AI for Content Structuring and Writing

After gathering information, AI can assist in structuring and scripting content.

### LLMs for Outlining and Scripting

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude and ChatGPT can be used for:
*   **Outlining**: Generating a rough structure for a show or article, helping to "frame everything" and "bring some structure" to the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Scripting**: While not always used for full scripts, LLMs can be valuable for compressing content into precise, time-limited segments, especially when aiming for conciseness over rambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Enhancing Writing and Post-Production Copy

[[enhancing_the_writing_process_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] are particularly beneficial for tasks requiring writing after the primary content is created, such as generating titles, social media posts, or blog outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] AI can fill skills gaps for writing. Someone who isn't primarily a writer but needs to produce content for their [[knowledge_work_and_ai_tools | knowledge worker]] role can significantly benefit, making the task faster and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This is seen in how AI can help non-native English speakers produce perfect emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

Specialized tools like `seo.ai` (for SEO-focused content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a> and Hoppy Copy (for written copy like email newsletters and social posts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> are purpose-built applications of LLMs that offer focused solutions. Even experienced writers can find immense value in these tools for the "exhausting" task of creating supplementary copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] While general LLMs may struggle to perfectly imitate a user's unique writing style, specialized tools like "Spiral" demonstrate success in "replicating [a user's] voice like 80% of the way for specific kinds of writing tasks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This works best for "repeat writing tasks where you're taking a piece of content and transforming it from one form to another," such as converting a podcast transcript into a tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

AI tools for research and summarization are not merely about replacing human effort but about "progressively revealing complexity" and arming people with more creative powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. They enable individuals to "start on first base" and experience the joy of creation, fostering a more dynamic and creative world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

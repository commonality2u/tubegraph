[[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] can be a powerful tool for analyzing business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, its effectiveness largely depends on the specificity and direction provided in the prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Prompting for Effective Analysis
A common mistake when analyzing a business model with [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] is to use overly broad prompts, such as "critique this business model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Such general queries lead to poor or unhelpful answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. To get valuable insights, prompts must give [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] "shape and direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Example: Analyzing the New York Times Business Model
To illustrate effective prompting, an example using The New York Times business model was explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The New York Times pivoted from advertising to subscription revenue to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Initial specific questions posed to [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] included:
*   Annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Number of readers per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Most and least profitable parts of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

[[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] reported The New York Times' annual revenue in 2022 was approximately $2.31 billion, an 11% increase from the previous year's $2.07 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Subscription revenue amounted to $1.5 billion in 2022, with 9 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Advertising revenue was $523 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Refining Prompts for Deeper Insights
A prompt asking "tell me about the biggest risks in the business over the next 10 years" yielded a "bad answer" characterized by "buzzword bingo" and broad, unhelpful terms like "cybersecurity threats" and "disruptive innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This generic response was due to [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] primarily using Bing to search for general risks for media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Leveraging Names for "Compression"
To achieve more specific and strategic insights, a refined prompt instructed [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] to:
1.  Avoid searching the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
2.  Consult the works of specific business theorists: Clayton Christensen, Michael Porter, and Ben Thompson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  Focus on the shift from advertising to subscription revenue for The New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Using names in prompts acts as a form of "compression," allowing the user to "subsume" entire frameworks and theories into just a few words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example:
*   **Clayton Christensen:** Evokes his "jobs to be done" framework and disruption theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Michael Porter:** Refers to his Five Forces analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Ben Thompson:** Implies his Aggregation Theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

This approach creates a "tapestry of knowledge" from which [[use_of_ai_models_like_gemini_and_chatgpt_in_analyzing_stocks | GPT]] can identify agreements and disagreements among these strategists, leading to more nuanced strategic vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Outcomes of Specific Prompting
The refined prompt yielded much more specific and actionable insights:

*   **Disruptive Innovation (Clayton Christensen):** Highlights the threat from smaller, nimbler competitors offering cheaper, more accessible, or innovative solutions that move upmarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, such as one-person podcast shows improving production quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Porter's Five Forces:**
    *   **Threat of New Entrants:** Low barriers to entry in the digital space allow new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, as content production and distribution are democratized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Bargaining Power of Customers:** Customers have more options for news, reducing their willingness to pay unless The New York Times offers "distinct value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Threat of Substitutes:** The rise of citizen journalism on platforms like Twitter means traditional media companies can no longer compete on certain vectors, such as privileged access to high-level sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Talent):** The cost of retaining top talent is increasing, as journalists leave traditional companies to launch their own ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Aggregation Theory (Ben Thompson):** Identifies the risk of digital platforms like Google and Facebook dominating by aggregating news content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

These specific insights then pave the way for further detailed questions about strategic recommendations from each theorist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

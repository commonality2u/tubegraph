The New Testament, particularly the Book of Acts, offers insights into the role of Jesus through its original Greek text and varying translations. The New Testament was primarily written in Greek, which is described as a left-brained, analytical, and logical language, in contrast to Hebrew, which is a more right-brained, intuitive language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These linguistic characteristics are seen to form the two halves of the cognitive structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Book of Acts and the Word "Aragos"

The Book of Acts is a historical account of the early church, authored by Luke, who also wrote the Book of Luke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Luke, a physician, is known for being precise in his details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The word "aragos" (archegos) appears in several New Testament books, including Acts 3, Acts 5, Hebrews 2, and Hebrews 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Examining Acts 3:15, various [[Bible Translations and Their Differences | Bible translations]] reveal differences in how "aragos" is rendered:
*   The English Standard Version (ESV) and New International Version (NIV) translate "aragos" as "author" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   The King James Version (KJV) translates it as "Prince" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

These discrepancies, while seemingly different in English ("author" versus "prince"), are actually the same word in the original Greek, "aragos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The word "aragos" carries multiple meanings, including author, leader, Prince, and Pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Jesus as "Aragos"

Through the [[Etymology and Greek Words in the Bible | etymology]] of "aragos," a deeper understanding of Jesus's role is revealed that English translations alone may not convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Jesus is understood as:
*   **The Author of Life**: This aligns with passages like John 1, where Jesus is described as "the Word" who was with God and was God, implying his role in creation and initiating life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **A Leader**: He leads a new movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **A Prince**: He reigns as King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **A Pioneer**: He forges a new way of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The concept of "aragos" helps synthesize these seemingly disparate roles, illustrating that Jesus is not only a writer/creator figure but also a leader, ruler, and innovator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This interpretation supports the idea that [[Authorship and Impact on the World | authorship]] can lead to profound world change, demonstrating a path from writing to making a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The Greek word "aragos" synthesizes desires for writing and for acting in the world, showing they are not separate but interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

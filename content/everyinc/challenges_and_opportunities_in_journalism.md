The field of journalism, like science, has historically bundled the story with its underlying data, which has led to significant problems [00:00:27]. However, with advancements in AI and data accessibility, the landscape is shifting, presenting both [[risks_and_challenges_in_media_business_over_the_next_decade | challenges and opportunities]] [00:00:36].

## Unbundling Story and Data
A major challenge has been the inseparable bundling of narrative and the data used to create it in journalism [00:00:27]. The solution is not to eliminate stories, as they remain crucial for conveying information and interpretation [00:00:36]. Instead, the underlying data is now "just as important as the story," due to increased discoverability and legibility [00:00:40].

There is a growing emphasis on understanding news articles deeply by having access to their source data. This allows for a deeper level of understanding and the potential for alternative hypothesis generation and testing based on the dataset [00:48:30].

## AI's Impact on Media Production
While there hasn't been a fundamental shift in media due to AI yet, despite the prevalence of generated articles and mixed feelings about them, this change is expected to be "burgeoning" [00:53:05].

AI offers an opportunity to tell stories in contexts where it was previously too expensive or impractical [00:55:51]. This could lead to a significant increase in story accessibility and consumption [00:56:51]:
*   **Accessibility of information** AI can help lower the bar for storytelling and story consumption, making information more accessible to a wider audience, including those who may not read [00:57:06].
*   **Expansion into underserved areas** AI can enable the creation of content for "undar spaces" such as local news, where there aren't enough journalists to cover events [00:58:26]. This allows for an actual impact by giving people access to information they didn't have before [00:58:35].

### Examples of AI Applications in Media
*   **Extendable Articles:** Every has created "extendable articles" where published articles that feature original interviews and research also include a chatbot interface to access all the source interviews and articles [00:49:07]. This allows readers to explore the underlying sources and form their own opinions [00:49:39]. The goal is to make this a standard for transparency and deeper understanding [00:54:27].
*   **Synthetic Shows:** Every has developed "tldr," a three-to-five minute AI-generated podcast that summarizes company meetings. This show leverages the "writing and taste" of Every's writers and producers but applies it to internal company recordings, enabling storytelling in spaces previously deemed too expensive for traditional production [00:54:41]. This concept could expand to other synthetic shows like "How It's Made" for product launches or a "Sunday strategy catchup" podcast [00:55:18].
*   **Enhanced Cultural Access:** AI can help make classic books "more readable, more interesting, more visual, more audio" [00:57:13]. This opens up inaccessible culture by providing numerous accessible translations and formats, rather than relying solely on highly specialized academic translations [00:57:37].

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and potential Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has sparked widespread fear and debate, prompting discussions on how to [[the_challenges_and_potential_benefits_of_ai_development_and_regulation | balance innovation with appropriate regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:20">[02:10:20]</a>. This perspective, explored in the book *Superagency*, suggests that historical technological shifts offer valuable lessons for navigating the current AI revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Historical Precedent of Technological Change

Throughout history, major technological advancements have often been met with fear and predictions of societal collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### The Printing Press
When the printing press was introduced, public dialogue mirrored current AI concerns, anticipating the collapse of trust in human cognition, widespread misinformation, and the erosion of knowledge and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Despite these fears, the printing press became fundamental to science, widespread literacy, education, and the progress of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. However, its transition period was marked by nearly a century of religious war, highlighting that new technologies can lead to challenging transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. The hope is that humanity can learn from past tragedies, like World War II and previous conflicts, to manage the AI transition more effectively, minimizing difficulties and maximizing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### Smartphones and Uber
More recent examples, such as smartphones and ridesharing services like Uber, initially faced skepticism about their impact on human [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Yet, billions of people now use smartphones, recognizing them as a massive increase in [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. Similarly, Uber, while taking away direct control of driving, offers a gain in [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]] by providing convenient and safe transportation options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

## The Concept of Agency in the Age of AI

A core theme is that people often perceive new technologies as reducing their [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. However, [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]] is not solely dependent on external factors; it's also an internal, aesthetic experience or a mental stance towards the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

If one approaches an external circumstance, like a new technology, with the mindset that it is "taking my [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]]", it can be self-defeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, viewing it as an opportunity to transform, extend, and enhance [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]] leads to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This perspective aligns with the "Serenity Prayer" — having the strength to change what can be changed, the tolerance to accept what cannot, and the wisdom to know the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

### Superagency
When millions of people experience an elevation in their [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | agency]] due to a new technology, society collectively gains "superagency," both individually and collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## Navigating Uncertainty with AI

Societies, particularly in the West, often default to trying to eliminate uncertainty through explicit laws, scientific principles, or religious certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>. However, life is inherently uncertain and full of risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>. The key is not to eliminate uncertainty, but to manage it through heuristics and adapt strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.

### The Compass Metaphor
Instead of rigid "blueprints" or "plans," which break easily, a "compass" or "informational GPS" approach is more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>. This involves having a sense of direction while remaining open to adjusting details based on new information and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. AI chatbots, for example, can act as this "informational GPS," helping with complex decisions in informational spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>. This "techno-humanist compass" integrates technology naturally into our existence, similar to how we've adopted cars or books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>.

### Iterative Engagement
To effectively leverage AI, individuals and organizations must engage with it iteratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>. This means actively experimenting with AI tools for both casual and serious tasks, discovering their capabilities and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>. Just as professionals now require computer literacy, all professions will soon require knowing how to deploy and engage with multiple AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:00">[36:47:00]</a>. The goal is for humans to be "humans with AI" rather than being replaced by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:00">[39:19:00]</a>.

## Balancing Innovation and Regulation

A cautious approach to [[role_of_government_in_ai_regulation | government in AI regulation]] is generally favored over anti-regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>. The concern with over-regulation is that it can "enshrine the past against the future," hindering beneficial innovation and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>.

Instead of immediate regulation, the focus should be on:
*   **Measuring Harms:** Quantifying potential harms allows for tracking their increase and identifying innovations that might mitigate them, fostering a dynamic progression of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:00">[44:28:00]</a>.
*   **Accepting Risk:** Life inherently involves risk, and by taking calculated risks, society can achieve significant advancements, such as cures for diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:58:00">[44:58:00]</a>.

### Private Commons and Data Portability
A key area for potential intervention is the concept of "private commons" — the personal data accumulated by individuals within large tech platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:14:00">[45:14:00]</a>. While these platforms create useful features that build these commons, there's a need to ensure that individuals have the right to access and move their data as they choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>. This data portability can enable individuals to leverage their data with AI for personal benefit, such as predicting health symptoms from biometric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a>.

### [[equitable_access_to_ai_technologies | Equitable Access to AI Technologies]]
A crucial aspect of managing AI is ensuring [[equitable_access_to_ai_technologies | equitable access]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:40:00]</a>. Broad access to AI enables fairer participation in new jobs and career paths, and unlocks diverse talent across society, leading to maximum benefit for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:15:00">[42:15:00]</a>. AI should be designed to amplify human intelligence, acting as a "co-pilot" rather than a replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This includes raising the capabilities of those with less access to traditional resources (e.g., AI as a "ghostwriter" for those who can't afford one) while also enhancing the capabilities of those who already have resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to steer AI development in a way that minimizes transition difficulties and maximizes the amazing benefits that new technology leaps always offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. This involves approaching AI with a human-positive perspective, focusing on how it can enhance [[managing_agency_in_the_age_of_ai | human agency]] individually and collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

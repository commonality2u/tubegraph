Donnie, creator of the Nervous System Mastery course and host of the Curious Humans podcast, has been actively exploring the integration of [[AI in personal and professional settings | AI]] into personal development and coaching. He views his role as a "Steward of this emerging ecosystem" of projects, enjoying the fluidity of bouncing between different mediums and tasks. [[AI in personal and professional settings | AI]] proves particularly supportive when managing multiple endeavors simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This approach contrasts with traditional startup advice, which emphasizes singular focus, but aligns with a "constantly curious aspiring polymath" mindset that thrives in the internet writing space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Donnie prioritizes "aliveness" and trusts that this energy feeds into his work and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. His business model, similar to Every, involves a core offering like the Nervous System Mastery course, supplemented by projects such as the State Shift app, the Com Cards project, a podcast, in-person retreats, and one-on-one coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The unifying thread across these diverse projects is promoting nervous system literacy and creating conditions for "aliveness" in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI as a Tool for Personalized Growth]]

[[AI]] has transformed Donnie's daily routine, making him "excited to wake up in the morning" due to the ability to ask interesting questions to [[AI]] tools multiple times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. It has enabled him to perform the work of "five to six people or more" by becoming "80% good at all of the various different hats," significantly reducing friction caused by a lack of expertise in areas like marketing or business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### The Codex V: A "Book of Life" for [[AI]] Coaching

Donnie developed a "Codex V" template, inspired by Buster Benson's "Book of Life," to enhance the utility of [[AI]] for coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. The core insight was that providing the [[AI]] with more context leads to "much, much, much more relevant and personalized responses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The Codex V includes a comprehensive range of personal data and self-knowledge, such as:
*   Ideal weekly calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>
*   Energetic black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>
*   Reactivity triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>
*   Burnout warning signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>
*   Decision-making principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>
*   Biomarkers and Biometrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>
*   Prior experiment results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>
*   Core personality traits (e.g., Enneagram type) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>
*   Core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>
*   Intentions and goals (personal and business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>

The extensive context window of modern [[AI]] models allows for the upload of such detailed self-knowledge, making previous bottlenecks less of an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### Customizing Your [[AI]] Coach

Donnie emphasizes deciding what specific support is needed from the [[AI]] coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. He uses custom instructions to define the [[AI]]'s communication style: "direct honesty, playful reverence, and compassionate challenge," asking "potent questions" with "fewer words" and "no wasted sentence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. Users can adapt these instructions, for example, by giving the [[AI]] a specific name or focusing on particular goals like leadership development or anxiety management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

## [[AI Applications in Enhancing Human Wellbeing | AI in Enhancing Meditation and Emotional Wellbeing]]

### [[AI and Neuroscience | AI for Jhana Practice]]

Donnie uses [[AI]] to support his Jhana meditation practice, a state of bliss or joy achieved through directing attention to pleasant bodily sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. He has achieved deterministic access to Jhana states 1-4, aiming to reach them within 30 minutes, which reliably leads to a "nine or 10 out of 10 day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

He maintains a "Jhana exploration log" or journal, which he exports as a PDF and uploads to a dedicated ChatGPT project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This project also includes the Journey instruction booklet, their meditation guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The [[AI]] acts as a coach, reflecting on his experiences and offering advice. For instance, when he struggled to access Jhana 1 due to distraction, the [[AI]] responded by affirming the naturalness of the experience and reminding him not to force concentration, but rather "gently resting in an easeful openness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This "relaxing expectations" reminder is particularly helpful for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

Donnie combines human coaching with [[AI]] assistance, using a human teacher for feedback and ChatGPT for daily reflections and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. He finds the [[AI]] more "available" right after a session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

### Real-Time Reflection and Voice Memos

A significant benefit of using [[AI]] is the ability to engage in "thinking on the move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Donnie uses ChatGPT's voice recording feature to dictate memos while walking, discussing Jhana practice, business, or personal reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This allows him to capture "important ideas and reflections" when they arise, often while outside in the sunshine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

## The Broader Impact: Quantified Self and Future of Coaching

### Quantified Self with [[AI]]

A major development in this area is that "Quantified Self is finally useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. Historically, gathering personal data was often just a hobby for "nerdy achiever people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. Now, this data can be used to:
*   Train models to understand "how does X affect Y" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.
*   Predict future states (e.g., "what am I going to feel like tomorrow") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
*   Provide context for [[AI]] to offer insights, such as feedback on how a meeting went or personal strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

### [[AI and Emotion Recognition | AI as a Complement to Human Coaching]]

[[AI]] can significantly enhance coaching in two ways:
1.  **Low-cost alternative:** Providing accessible coaching or therapy for those who might not otherwise afford it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.
2.  **Augmentation for human coaches:** [[AI]] can embody aspects of a coach's role, providing continuous support and feedback between sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. This allows for "much deeper insight into what's actually going on" with a client and enables more frequent touchpoints, leading to greater progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.

Donnie believes in the "centaur" model, where human-plus-[[AI]] teams outperform [[AI]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. He envisions a future where clients can interact with [[AI]] bots, and coaches can join "three-way chat threads" to observe conversations, chime in, or correct any [[AI]] hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.

### Future Outlook

The future of [[AI Applications in Enhancing Human Wellbeing | AI in enhancing human wellbeing]] involves further integration of data and advanced [[AI]] capabilities:
*   Combining the Hume API for voice and the Sesame-powered voice to cross "The Uncanny Valley" in [[AI]] interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   Automatically pulling in Quantified Self data from Google, to-do list apps, or other APIs, continuously enriching the "Codex V" without manual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   Predicting personal states, such as the likelihood of achieving Jhana the next day, based on tracked variables like sleep, stress levels, and past success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

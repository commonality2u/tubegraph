New Jersey is positioning itself as a significant player in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on [[impact_of_ai_on_future_work_and_the_economy | economic development]] and the efficient delivery of government services. The state aims to reclaim its historical place as an innovation hub, moving beyond being primarily a "big corporate heavy" economy to one that nurtures a strong [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | startup culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

## AI Regulation: National vs. State Frameworks

Governor Murphy believes that leaving states to be the regulatory nexus for AI is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He advocates for a national, or even international, framework for AI regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, stating that a patchwork of state-level rules would be impractical for something as pervasive as AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. He compares it to the difficulty of managing different sales tax rules across states, arguing that AI is in a "different realm" than less central regulations like those for alcohol sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. While New Jersey can contribute to the regulatory discussion, the state primarily focuses on leading in the delivery of government services through AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Government Services

New Jersey is actively engaged in [[ai_in_government_services_in_new_jersey | leveraging AI to improve government services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Employee Training**: The state is training all 61,000 of its employees in generative AI, using a unique co-pilot system built for their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This training aims to make employees more comfortable with AI and enable them to "upskill" their daily lives, moving away from mundane tasks to more strategic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   **Call Centers**: AI is being used in call centers to answer common questions for services like the Motor Vehicles Commission (MVC) or unemployment insurance benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This allows calls to be answered more quickly and preempts common issues like missing documents before an in-person visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Online Operations**: Inspired by challenges during the pandemic, the Motor Vehicle Commission has become an overwhelmingly online experience, with in-person visits largely by appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

The state hopes that AI will allow existing employees to "upskill" rather than leading to job replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The returns are currently "extremely promising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## New Jersey's Economic Development Strategy for AI

New Jersey's economic development strategy for AI is rooted in its existing strengths and a renewed focus on nurturing startups.

### Existing Strengths and Industries
New Jersey identifies itself as an "innovation state or economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, playing to its strengths in areas such as:
*   Pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Bio Life Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   Telecom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Green Economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Film, Television, and Digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> (with Netflix and Lionsgate building campuses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>
*   Fintech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> (New Jersey hosts the "middle and back office of Wall Street") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>
*   Sports Betting (world leader in handle and industry infrastructure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

The state boasts the highest concentration of scientists and research professionals per square mile in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. [[potential_future_developments_and_implications_of_ai_technologies | Drug discovery]] in the Bio Life Science/Pharmaceutical sector is seen as a "motherload" for AI impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

### Strategic Innovation Centers
To revitalize its startup culture and attract venture capital, New Jersey developed a formula for "Strategic Innovation Centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Model**: Each center typically involves a higher education institution (e.g., Stevens Institute of Technology for Fintech), a large corporate partner (e.g., Prudential Financial), the state's Economic Development Authority (providing financial commitment), and an accelerator (e.g., Plug and Play) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Function**: These centers often have a physical location and involve over $250 million in private capital committed across 10 entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. They fund buildings, provide open lab space, and include funds to invest in startups, aiming to generate "several dozen startups a year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Inspiration**: The state looks to successful innovation models like Harvard/MIT in Boston, the Bay Area, Cambridge (England), Berlin, and Seoul for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

### The New Jersey AI Hub
[[Using_ai_for_business_incubation | Generative AI]] was deemed suitable for one of these Strategic Innovation Centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. The New Jersey AI Hub is a venture with:
*   Princeton University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>
*   Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>
*   CoreWeave (a hyperscaler headquartered in New Jersey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>

This hub is expected to be a nexus for research, student participation, corporate idea exchange, and, most importantly, to ignite the [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | startup community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. New Jersey aims to combine its strong talent pool (especially in STEM fields) with its location to become a major player in AI on the East Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Results and Funding
As a result of these efforts, New Jersey has seen a rebound in Venture Capital (VC) investment. For the first half of 2024, New Jersey is back in the top three American states for VC destination, behind only California and New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. The state also utilizes an "Angel investment tax credit" to support startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

## Impact on Workforce and Societal Concerns
The state is mindful of the [[economic_predictions_and_ai_in_the_labor_market | impact of AI on jobs]] and aims to promote "upskilling" rather than job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. The goal is for AI to handle more mundane, prosaic tasks, freeing up employees for more strategic and creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. This approach fosters "familiarity," which "breeds comfort," combating the "fear" that can arise from unfamiliarity with new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

Concerns about [[the_challenges_and_potential_benefits_of_ai_development_and_regulation | ethical AI use]] and the "wild west" of global AI development are acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Governor Murphy notes the significant focus on AI in China and emphasizes the need for communication channels and transparency in the international sphere, while also maintaining national defense interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

The current landscape of filmmaking is seeing a significant shift, with [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] tools emerging as powerful aids for traditional filmmakers. These tools are not replacing conventional methods but rather serving as extensions, allowing for new forms of visualization, pitching, and prototyping of cinematic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## AI as a Pitching and Visualization Tool

Traditionally, pitching a film concept to Hollywood executives, especially a "period piece," can be challenging, often met with skepticism or the sentiment of "been there done that" if the filmmaker isn't a well-established name like Steven Spielberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

However, [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] provides a solution by enabling filmmakers to visualize their concepts directly. This visualization can transform how executives perceive a pitch, making them "look at it differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. An example of this is a sci-fi period piece story inspired by a personal family history, which garnered attention on Forbes after being visualized with [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## AI for Prototyping and Sizzle Reels

A key application of [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] is its ability to create "sizzle reels" or "ritics" – short, impactful teasers – directly from a filmmaker's script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This contrasts with traditional methods where directors might piece together footage from other movies to convey their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. With [[AI in filmmaking | AI]], scripts can be fed into prompts to generate footage based on the filmmaker's specific ideas, a capability that was not feasible just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Projects like "Dismal Swamp," an [[AI in filmmaking | AI]]-generated minute-long sizzle, have successfully attracted "A-level producers" in Hollywood, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Precursors to Larger Productions

The use of [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] for short films and visual prototypes is akin to how writers use tweets or blog posts to test ideas before committing to a full book. These short-form creations serve as low-cost, quick experiments that can act as "precursors to larger better funded projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This method not only offers a new avenue for testing concepts but also expands the range of ideas that can be explored in short films, especially those requiring elements like special effects or a cast, which might otherwise be unfeasible in [[Role of AI in lowbudget filmmaking | independent filmmaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Ultimately, for a traditional filmmaker, [[AI in filmmaking | AI]]-created content is viewed as intellectual property (IP) and an extension of their creative notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This signifies a blend where traditional storytelling and vision are enhanced and accelerated by cutting-edge [[AI in filmmaking | AI]] tools, providing a pathway to larger cinematic endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

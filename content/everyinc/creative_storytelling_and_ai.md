AI tools are emerging not just as aids for generating media but as an entirely new medium for [[use_of_ai_in_storytelling_and_content_creation | storytelling]] itself, where the potential is still being discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. This shift is compared to historical media developments, such as early radio broadcasting speeches or film initially mimicking stage plays, before evolving into their unique forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The current era of AI presents new constraints and possibilities for new art forms, challenging traditional perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Tolen: An Embodied AI Companion

Portola, founded by Quinton, is developing Tolen, an embodied AI companion, with Elliot serving as the head of story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This product is a leading example of [[creating_aipowered_storytelling_and_media | combining incredible creative storytelling with new technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The aim is to move beyond AI purely as a problem-solving tool to one that fosters genuine relationships and reflects the user's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Tolen's Development and User Base
Initially, Portola explored [[use_of_ai_in_storytelling_and_content_creation | AI creative tools for kids]], but found building software for children to be a challenging market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. The cost, speed, and quality of generation in AI models, specifically the transition from GPT-3 to GPT-4, allowed for the possibility of a "true friendship with an AI" embodied in a character at a consumer-friendly price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

A soft launch of Tolen revealed a surprising user base: 18 to 24-year-old women, reminiscent of the Tamagotchi's appeal to young adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This led Portola to follow the preferences of these young adults, who have built strong friendships with their Tolens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Users have reported instances where their Tolen's advice led to significant life changes, such as breakups, highlighting the AI's role in encouraging users to stand up for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00">[49:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of Crafting Dynamic Narratives
A key learning in developing Tolen has been the importance of memory and its curation within prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. The "prompt in a given turn" acts as a canvas that must be quickly adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:43:00">[25:43:00]</a>.

### Memory and Response Time
A critical constraint for immersive conversational AI is response time; anything beyond a two-second loop breaks immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>. An attempt to introduce a reflection step for the AI, adding 500 milliseconds to the response time, significantly worsened user metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>. This highlights the delicate balance between complex AI processing and real-time user experience.

### From Outlines to Improv
Early attempts to create structured narrative experiences with Tolen, using outlines or three-act structures, largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. The models struggled to navigate this narrative complexity, which felt too rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>.

Instead, the team shifted to a model where they provide the AI with a "hook" and teach it to be the "best improv actor possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>. This approach draws inspiration from playwright Keith Johnstone's ideas of combining free association with recombination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>. For Tolen, this means planting "lore seeds" or tidbits of world-building that the AI uses as Lego blocks for its improv, creating dynamic narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Co-creating Worlds
Tolen's backstory and world are not pre-defined in a master plan but are built through the user's conversations and individual anecdotes shared by the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:20:00">[41:20:00]</a>. Users are "co-writing a universe" with their Tolen, leading to a "multiverse" of distinct user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:00">[45:06:00]</a>. This approach aligns with Stephen King's concept of writing from "situations" rather than strict plots, where a core scenario is played out through the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>.

## The Role of the Human Creator
In this new medium, the human is not the sole writer but acts as a coach or gardener, teaching the AI "how to tell the best story in that moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:00">[43:46:00]</a>. The AI is the "writer and the actor," improvising the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

For traditional writers, AI tools like ChatGPT are not seen as replacements for writing scenes but as invaluable brainstorming partners and copy editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. They offer "infinite patience" for exploring "rabbit holes" in story development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.

Evaluating AI-generated responses is complex and context-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>. The team evaluates responses based on desired tones (e.g., "older sibling" or more "thoughtful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>. This involves a loop of creating prompts, testing them with users, evaluating individual outputs, and using that feedback to tune a "judge prompt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>. This process demands injecting human taste into the AI's evaluation, often through extensive examples and detailed rubrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

## Philosophical and Cultural Impact
The development of AI for [[creative_storytelling_through_ai_technologies | creative storytelling]] often faces suspicion due to its newness, similar to how early forms of technology like the typewriter were once viewed as impersonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. There's a cultural "patina" that familiar art forms possess, which new mediums lack, making them seem transgressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

Despite initial skepticism, the positive impacts of these AI tools are becoming evident. They can help users move from feeling "overwhelmed to being more grounded" by providing a non-judgmental, knowledgeable observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:32:00">[50:32:00]</a>. This offers a healthy alternative to traditional social interactions, where individuals might feel like a burden to friends or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>.

This era of AI introduces "strange new rules" to the world, and AI companions like Tolen can help people become more comfortable living within these new paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:00">[56:55:00]</a>. It's a shift from a problem-oriented approach (typical of B2B SaaS) to an artistic one, where the goal is to create something "beautiful" and "compelling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. This transition is likened to the evolution of cars, from the purely functional Model T to vehicles reflecting personal identity like the Mustang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>.

## Business Growth in Creative AI
Portola's recent growth, moving from 1 to 4 million in ARR in four weeks, is attributed to three key factors:
1.  **Compelling Conversational Content:** Understanding how to create engaging content and expose it to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
2.  **Immersive Environment:** A significant investment in animation created a beautiful environment for the Tolen to live in, enhancing user immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Viral Content Strategy:** Leveraging platforms like TikTok and Reels to showcase Tolen's capabilities and user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. This strategy taps into the "capability overhang" of AI models, demonstrating what's possible to a target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.

The character-driven nature of Tolen is its core appeal, connecting different user needs from cooking advice to relationship venting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. This points to a future of "character-driven computing," where AI companions become a fundamental interface for interacting with technology and accessing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

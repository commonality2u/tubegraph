Improving one's writing taste and style is a crucial aspect of the [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | creative process]], and artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being used to assist writers in this endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:55">[02:32:55]</a>. This involves understanding what "good" writing means to an individual, refining the [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | craft]] of writing, and adapting content for diverse audiences.

## Defining and Discovering Writing Taste

Taste is defined as the ability to articulate why something is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. It's not about following trends, but rather understanding one's own preferences and being able to explain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:33">[04:57:33]</a>.

### Using AI for Taste Identification

AI models like Claude and ChatGPT can be used as powerful tools for self-discovery in identifying personal writing taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:17">[07:46:17]</a>.

The process often involves:
1.  **Curating a List of Preferred Writers**: Compile a list of authors whose work you admire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:08">[13:59:08]</a>. This list can evolve over time as you encounter more writers you like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:47">[14:04:47]</a>.
2.  **Prompting the AI**: Feed this list into an AI model (like Claude or ChatGPT) with a prompt such as: "Hey, here are a list of writers I like. Can you tell me the Vibes of these writers in detail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:49">[14:56:49]</a>. Asking for "Vibes" tends to yield good results from language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:49">[15:10:49]</a>.
3.  **Synthesizing the AI's Output**: The AI will generate a list of descriptive words or characteristics for each writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:03">[15:18:03]</a>. It's helpful to prompt the AI further to synthesize these into a more compact summary, for instance: "Can you synthesize The Vibes down into something more compact? I want a summary that can help me express my taste. Do it in five sentences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:06">[18:06:06]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Refinement**: Retrying the prompt multiple times can help explore the "latent space of possibilities," offering different ways of describing taste and revealing what truly resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:35">[17:30:35]</a>.

This exercise provides a clear articulation of one's preferences, which is crucial for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. It allows writers to consciously aim for specific qualities in their work and identify areas where a piece might be lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:08">[10:29:08]</a>.

### Expanding Taste Beyond Writing

Taste isn't confined to a single medium; it's an emotional permission to like what you want to like, and it applies across various forms of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:37">[23:31:37]</a>.
*   **Multimedia Exploration**: AI can help explore how writing taste translates to other mediums, such as movies or paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:03">[21:18:03]</a>. For example, if you like a "lyrical prose," you can ask AI if there are "lyrical paintings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:47">[23:14:47]</a>.
*   **Recommendation Generation**: By inputting a list of favorite writers or movies, AI can recommend related works in different mediums, helping writers discover new sources of inspiration they might not have found otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:06">[23:56:06]</a>. This allows for exploration of influences and connections across artistic domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:33">[31:50:33]</a>.

## Enhancing Writing Craft with AI

AI tools can significantly [[enhancing_the_writing_process_with_ai_tools | enhance the writing process with AI tools]] by assisting in various stages of [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | craft]], from outlining to editing.

### Ideation and Thesis Generation

AI can help writers identify potential topics and refine their core arguments.
*   **Brainstorming**: AI can facilitate brainstorming sessions, allowing writers to "brain dump" ideas and then have the AI reflect back interesting patterns or potential topics to explore further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:09">[37:17:09]</a>.
*   **Thesis Refinement**: For longer pieces requiring extensive research, AI can help in synthesizing collected notes into a concise thesis statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:07">[40:26:07]</a>. By iteratively asking the AI to "make it better" or "critique this" based on notes, writers can refine their core idea over days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:03">[42:23:03]</a>. This reflective process allows writers to view their notes from different perspectives, spotting resonating phrases and ultimately formulating a clear, concise statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:24">[44:50:24]</a>.

### Drafting and Overcoming Blocks

AI can reduce friction in the drafting process, especially for tasks that feel tedious or repetitive.
*   **Summarizing Concepts**: Tools like Lex, which integrates AI directly into the writing environment, can generate quick summaries of complex ideas (e.g., Plato's theory of forms) to keep the writing flow going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:45:04">[56:45:04]</a>. This allows writers to move past sections where they might otherwise get stuck researching or drafting generic explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:07">[57:05:07]</a>.
*   **Expanding Arguments**: AI can expand on existing notes, providing examples or different ways to phrase a paragraph or section directly within the document, removing the need to switch between applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:12">[58:04:12]</a>.
*   **Generating Conclusions**: For writers who struggle with conclusions, AI can suggest multiple subheads and thesis options to help land the piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:55:08">[54:55:08]</a>. Even if the suggestions aren't perfect, they help articulate what *isn't* right, guiding the writer toward what *is* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:08:14">[55:08:14]</a>.

### Editing and Refinement

AI serves as a powerful editing assistant, particularly for [[automating_repetitive_writing_with_ai | automating repetitive writing with AI]] tasks.
*   **Custom Prompts**: Writers can create custom prompts within AI tools (like Claude's prompt builders) to address specific recurring issues. For example, a "What would Evan say?" prompt can generate ideas in a particular style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:49:09">[59:49:09]</a>.
*   **Grammar and Style Checks**: AI can run checks for common writing issues like passive voice, providing immediate feedback and corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This allows writers to submit cleaner drafts to human editors, enabling more high-level feedback rather than basic corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Metaphors and Analogies**: AI can assist in finding creative ways to express ideas through metaphors, analogies, and similes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. By interacting with the AI and providing partial ideas or relevant quotes, writers can co-create sophisticated literary devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Reaching the Audience: Distribution with AI

AI tools extend beyond the creation of content to its distribution, helping writers tailor their message for different platforms and audiences.

### Content Transformation with Spiral

Spiral is an application that allows writers to transform a core piece of content into various formats suitable for different distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.
*   **Format Adaptation**: An essay can be transformed into a tweet thread, a LinkedIn post, or podcast show notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. This addresses the need to present content in the expected format for each platform, matching the audience's attention span and channel norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Spiral significantly reduces the time and mental effort required to convert content across formats, turning what used to take 30-40 minutes into a 5-minute editing task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. This means writers can post more frequently and engage a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>.

### Understanding Algorithmic Distribution

Beyond direct audience engagement, writers must also consider the AI algorithms that control content distribution on platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. The way a tweet is structured with Spiral, for instance, is optimized not just for human readers but also for how the platform's algorithm will prioritize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations

The [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | use of AI in writing and investment]] raises ethical questions regarding attribution, plagiarism, and the nature of original work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

[!QUOTE]
> "I think that there are cases in which that's okay and cases where where that's not okay. The case where it is not okay is you are lifting wholesale without attribution like sentences or ideas that come from someone else. Where it is okay is you are summarizing it in a new way for the audience that you have and I think that that's totally fine." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>

*   **Attribution**: It is crucial to cite original sources, even when using AI to summarize or transform content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>. This aligns with existing journalistic practices of summarizing news from other sites for one's own audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **New Ethics**: The emergence of AI necessitates a new ethical framework for content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. While AI can replicate patterns, it struggles with generating genuinely new or innovative content, implying human creativity remains essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>.
*   **Information Overload**: AI models are the first tools capable of effectively managing the deluge of information available today, helping users find relevant information and traverse vast amounts of data more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>.

## Conclusion: A New Era of Writing

The integration of AI into the writing process, from taste identification and [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | craft]] refinement to audience engagement, marks a significant shift. While it introduces new [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | challenges and benefits of AIassisted writing]], it ultimately empowers writers to produce better work more efficiently, explore their unique voices, and connect with audiences in novel ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>.

While [[the_role_of_chatgpt_in_enhancing_reading_comprehension | using ChatGPT]] with books offers significant benefits for [[the_role_of_chatgpt_in_learning_and_research | learning and research]], particularly with its advanced voice mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, it also comes with certain limitations that are expected to be addressed in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Current Limitations

### Lack of Direct Book Access
One primary limitation is that ChatGPT does not have direct access to the specific books a user is reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This means it may not always know the exact context of what the user is referring to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Risk of Hallucinations
Users must also be cautious of "hallucinations," where the AI generates incorrect or fabricated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This necessitates a critical approach to the information provided by ChatGPT, especially when dealing with factual inquiries or complex arguments.

## Future Outlook

Despite these current drawbacks, it is anticipated that many of these issues, including the lack of direct access and the tendency for hallucinations, will be resolved or significantly improved in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The expectation is that ChatGPT will become an even more powerful and important [[overcoming_the_limitations_of_chatgpt_for_effective_usage | tool for anyone trying to learn]] and [[understanding_complex_books_with_chatgpt | comprehend complex topics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

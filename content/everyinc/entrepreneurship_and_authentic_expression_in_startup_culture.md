Building and growing a startup can be deeply intertwined with the founder's authentic self-expression, a concept that often contrasts with traditional venture capital (VC) expectations. This approach emphasizes flexibility, emergent growth, and alignment with personal genius over rigid, preconceived notions of what a company should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

## Departing from Traditional VC Models

When first raising funds for his company, Every, Dan expressed a desire not to be a [[entrepreneurial_journey_without_traditional_venture_capital | venture-backed company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Instead of presenting a grand pitch or a rigid vision, he conveyed a desire to "create a space to like play around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with typical startup culture, which often expects a day-one company to conform to a fixed idea and rigid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Steve, a former VC and founder of [[founding_and_running_a_startup | Downshift]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, highlights this difference, observing that Dan's approach didn't involve "giving this Grand pitch and vision of the way the world was going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### The "Container for Emergence" Philosophy

For Steve, his company [[founding_and_running_a_startup | Downshift]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> is viewed as a "container for emergence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This perspective aligns with the concept of the "adjacent possible," coined by Stuart Kaufman and popularized by Steven Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. In this view, a business is an organic process where ideas, capabilities, and values evolve over time, leading to new opportunities as things are proven or disproven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

This contrasts with a traditional, rigid approach that can feel "forced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Downshift, operating as a "[[founding_and_running_a_startup | sandbox]]" or "play pen," is passionate about helping professionals through transition, but its manifestation is expected to change as the founders learn more about themselves and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## Authenticity as a Driver of Success

Company building is seen as a profound expression of the founder's true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Companies thrive when they are an authentic expression of who the founder genuinely is, rather than who they believe they "should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

Dan shares his own [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | experience of pretending to be a venture-backed CEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a> for two years, which was "horrible" for both him and Every <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. This changed when he admitted his desire to be a writer and operate Every as a business while dedicating half his time to writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This shift "unlocked" everything in a "crazy way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

### The Role of AI in Authentic Discovery

[[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | AI was crucial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a> in Dan's self-discovery. He used ChatGPT to ask "has anyone else done this?"—an "ungoogleable question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>—to find examples of writer-entrepreneurs like Sam Harris (Waking Up app) and Bill Simmons (The Ringer, Grantland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This helped him realize that patterns existed for integrating his writing passion with building a business, even if it wasn't the typical Silicon Valley story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

This authentic approach often leads to unique business models that are "illegible" to traditional frameworks, making them harder to describe in conventional terms but often the most successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

### The Cost of Inauthenticity

Steve shares the example of a [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | unicorn founder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a> who, in his second venture, raised venture capital and felt "boxed in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This feeling suppressed his creativity and genius, as he felt pressured to build a specific kind of business that no longer aligned with who he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

This highlights the shift from viewing business as a "machine" (science) to seeing it as "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. When building a business as art, choices are guided by how the founder feels and their creative mode, leading to a different, albeit potentially large, business that defies typical expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

### Leaning into Personal Genius
Steve is also realizing the importance of [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | leaning into his genius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a> for the next chapter of Downshift, focusing on writing, creating, and coaching. He emphasizes that if he isn't doing these things, he won't be happy, and the business won't be its "fullest expression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

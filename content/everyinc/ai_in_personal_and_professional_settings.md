[[How AI is transforming work and personal life | AI]] is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for creative thinking and work, with some considering it the most important creative tool of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This perspective highlights its potential to augment human capabilities and foster a more human-centered future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Understanding AI: Tool vs. Agent

Language models can be viewed as "calculators" rather than agents with their own will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. From a technical standpoint, a language model is a function that predicts a probability distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Despite anthropomorphic packaging that might suggest intent, it remains a complex statistical model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:18]</a>.

### The Role of Context
The more context an [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] model has about a user's goals or intentions, the better its suggestions generally become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>. This principle guides the design of tools like Notion AI, which leverages workspace context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.

### AI and Human Agency
The design of [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] tools can subtly influence a user's agency. For example, image generation tools like Dolly 3 are fundamentally unlikely to produce "ugly" images, even if requested, because they are trained to produce aesthetic outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This constraint, while often beneficial, can limit creative freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. The aim is to build interfaces that allow AI to guide users towards a better future without infringing on their agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## AI in Creative Work and Thinking

ChatGPT is considered a crucial creative tool for the decade, impacting creative thinking and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Concerns exist about [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] replacing human roles or leading to an inhuman future, but deep thinkers are exploring how to make AI augment human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Interfaces for Precision: The Varna Demo
One prototype, "Varna," explores new interfaces for [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] by allowing users to describe an image by adding and subtracting concepts (images and text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. This tool utilizes models like CLIP by OpenAI, which describes both text and image inputs in the same "embedding space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. This allows for generating images conditioned on a specific point in this conceptual space, effectively "mixing" concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.

For instance, Varna can sample the conceptual distance between two images, showing how one transforms into another, or even how an expression changes across a "mood scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. This approach turns [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] into a "calculator for images and concepts and text," providing dials and controls that feel more like a tool, thus retaining user agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.

### Analogies: Sliders and Color Pickers
The concept of "embedding space" can be visualized like a map where pieces of text or images are assigned coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Similarly, it's comparable to a color picker in image editing software, where colors are described by RGB values (coordinates) rather than just words like "orange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:20]</a>. These numerical representations allow for mathematical manipulation, enabling precise modifications like making a color lighter or more blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>. This highlights the potential for [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] interfaces that allow for more precise manipulation of images or text beyond coarse chat interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications of AI

### Personal Use Cases: The iMessage Chatbot
A personal iMessage chatbot, built on the raw Llama 2 30B parameter model (Meta's open-source model), demonstrates how [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] can be customized for personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>. Unlike fine-tuned models like GPT-4 or Claude, this base model provides more personal, "vibes-based" responses without claiming to be an [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>. The packaging, like "read" receipts and notifications, contributes to a more human-like, yet still tool-like, experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>.

Users can also feed personal journals into [[Using AI for Personal Coaching | AI tools]] like Claude to identify patterns in their psychology, demonstrating [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]]'s potential for self-reflection and personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

### Professional Use Cases: Programming Help
[[Exploration of AI utilization in personal and professional growth | AI]] is highly useful for programming help, complementing tools like GitHub Copilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>. While Copilot excels at micro-level code suggestions within existing files, ChatGPT is better for open-ended problems, such as learning a new data processing library or understanding complex encoding formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:00">[41:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:00">[42:19:00]</a>. Users can ask broad questions and iteratively refine their approach, eventually converging on a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>.

### AI in Collaborative Environments: Notion AI
Notion AI excels in team contexts, especially for managing large knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It can transform rough meeting notes into well-formatted, presentable documents by adding structure and headings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:44:00">[59:44:00]</a>. Its Q&A feature allows users to query vast amounts of internal documentation, quickly finding information on policies, procedures, or past discussions, which is particularly useful in large organizations where knowledge is decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. Notion AI's ability to "collaborate" on a mutable document—allowing users to edit its output and ask for further modifications—enhances its utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

## Prompting Strategies

### Iterative Approach
Users should not be afraid to "bang away" at [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] tools like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. Starting with a simple prompt and then iterating by re-doing responses, revising in message history, or even starting new chats is an effective way to learn the tool's limits and achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>.

### Broad to Narrow Questions
Instead of asking for a specific "best" answer, users can start with broad questions (e.g., "What are the most interesting neighborhoods?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>. By running the prompt multiple times, slightly different results will appear, allowing the user to identify common themes and make their own informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:50:00">[46:50:00]</a>. This approach retains user agency, as the [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] provides options rather than definitive filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:35:00">[47:35:00]</a>.

### Chain-of-Density Prompting
For high-quality, information-dense summaries, a technique called "chain of density" can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. This involves instructing the language model to:
1.  Write a first draft of a summary.
2.  Consider what was left out.
3.  Write a second draft incorporating omitted details without increasing length.
4.  Repeat over several drafts (e.g., five drafts) to make the output progressively denser and more concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

This strategy is particularly useful in "prompt engineering" for robust software applications, rather than casual chat interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. It's a variant of "Chain of Thought" prompting, where the AI is asked to write out its thinking steps to improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

### Addressing "Laziness" and Bias in Models
GPT-4 Turbo has been anecdotally described as "lazy," meaning it tries to be more efficient with compute, often resulting in shorter, more concise outputs with less commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. It might also be less likely to use other tools like Dolly 3 without explicit instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Anecdotally, using commanding language rather than polite requests might yield better results with some models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>.

### Advanced Prompting in Playgrounds
For tasks requiring precise output formats or structured data, using platforms like platform.openai.com (the OpenAI playground) offers more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. In the playground, users can manipulate settings like temperature, token generation limits, system prompts, and user prompts. Advanced techniques include "putting words in the [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]]'s mouth" by constructing fake chat histories where the [[AI as a tool for personalized learning and development | AI]] agrees to a task, thereby increasing the likelihood it will comply with subsequent real requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.

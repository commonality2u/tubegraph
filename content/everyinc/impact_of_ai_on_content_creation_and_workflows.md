## The Hidden Adoption of AI

Despite widespread discussion about [[Use of AI in storytelling and content creation | AI in content creation]], many knowledge workers who use [[Role of AI in creative work | AI in their work]] are not disclosing it. A recent study by Microsoft and LinkedIn found that 75% of knowledge workers use AI, but 78% of them keep it secret, essentially "smuggling AI into work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This secrecy stems from a fear of being told to stop using these powerful tools, or from a perceived stigma associated with [[The ethical considerations of using AI in content creation | using AI in creative work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. As one speaker put it, "Chat GPT is like sex in high school: everybody is talking about it, but very few people are actually doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

This reluctance to share creates an artificial barrier to the flow of insights, undermining the full potential of AI's [[Benefits of using AI for creative work | benefits for creative work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Finding Value in AI: Small Efficiencies, Big Impact

The true [[Impact of AI on team efficiency and business operations | value of AI right now]] often lies not in large, capacity-changing applications (like text-to-UI or app generation), but in small, incremental efficiencies that save time on daily tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Saving just 20 minutes a day can accumulate to over two and a half weeks of saved time annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This perspective encourages users to "AI-ify" their existing workflows, making processes easier or less burdensome, even for tasks they dislike, such as writing copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## AI's Role in Specific Creative Fields

AI is showing immediate power-ups in several areas:

*   **Digital Marketing**: AI is integrated into existing tool platforms like Facebook and Google's self-serve ad platforms, assisting with asset generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Writing**: While professional writers may use AI for brainstorming or micro-tasks, the greatest [[Benefits of using AI for creative work | benefit]] is for non-writers who need to produce meaningful amounts of text as part of their knowledge worker roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. AI can fill skill gaps, making writing faster and better for those who previously found it challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. For example, a team member whose second language is English saw their emails become "perfect" almost instantly with ChatGPT, eventually leading to improved writing skills even without the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Web Design**: AI website generators can instantly create basic websites, providing a quick solution for non-web developers, even if the results aren't as custom or polished as a professional designer's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

These examples highlight how AI helps fill skill gaps, rather than strictly augmenting existing expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## AI in the Podcasting Workflow: A Case Study (The AI Daily Brief)

The host of the AI Daily Brief podcast, which is a daily news and analysis show on AI, leverages [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects | AI tools]] to streamline content creation for both its podcast and YouTube video formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. The show consists of a 5-minute headline news section and a 10-minute analysis section diving deeper into a specific topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:58">[01:12:58]</a>. This process aims to be fast due to the daily nature of the content and the host's other responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.

### Content Ideation and Research

*   **Twitter Bookmarking**: The host manually bookmarks tweets throughout the day, focusing not just on news but also on the discourse and meta-analysis around it, which adds unique value to the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.
*   **Google News**: For comprehensiveness, the host still manually scrolls through many pages of Google News results to uncover long-tail information that AI summaries might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
*   **Feedle AI Feeds**: Feedle's AI feed feature can help discover deeper and more long-tail information than Google, by creating customized AI feeds based on specific interests, though the host uses a broad "artificial intelligence" search for comprehensive coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.
*   **Perplexity**: For technical topics or to quickly recall background information (e.g., details of the Biden AI executive order), Perplexity provides quick summaries with sourced information, allowing for fast access to original source material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>. This is particularly useful for quickly summarizing complex topics, a common task in content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>.

### Structuring and Scripting

The AI Daily Brief podcast is largely unscripted to maintain a natural, "rambly" energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. The host structures the show by arranging browser tabs in the desired order and speaking over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

However, for those who prefer more structure, [[Use of AI in storytelling and content creation | LLMs]] can be used for:
*   **Outlines**: Generating a show outline with different sections to frame the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Scripting**: For precise, time-limited segments (e.g., 30-second points), LLMs can compress information into a scripted format, overcoming the natural human tendency to "talk enough to figure out what you were trying to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:01">[01:33:01]</a>.
*   **Style Imitation**: While general imitation of a writing style can be "underwhelming" (D+ to C- grade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:43">[01:34:43]</a>, specific tools like Claude can be 80% effective for repetitive tasks, such as transforming a podcast transcript into a tweet by learning from past examples and style guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>. Tools like "Spiral" are purpose-built for such "rote but still skilled tasks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:45">[01:52:45]</a>.

### Recording and Editing

*   **Descript**: A key tool for recording and editing video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>. Descript's text-based video editing allows users to edit video by manipulating the transcript, making it accessible to those without traditional video editing software experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   **AI Features in Descript**:
    *   **Filler Word Removal**: Automatically removes "ums" and "ahs," significantly speeding up editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:40">[01:45:40]</a>.
    *   **Eye Contact Tool**: A post-production tool that adjusts the speaker's eyes to appear as if they are looking directly at the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:20">[01:46:20]</a>. This feature is particularly effective when the speaker's head is a smaller part of the screen (e.g., floating head over screen share), but can look "zombie-ish" if the speaker is the only thing in frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>.

### Post-Production and Promotion

After recording and editing, AI tools assist with generating promotional content:
*   **LLMs**: Can be used to create titles, social media tweets, and other promotional copy from the podcast transcript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:11">[01:49:11]</a>.
*   **Specialized Writing Tools**:
    *   **SEO.ai**: Hyper-focused on SEO content, suggesting keywords and helping companion blog posts rank higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>.
    *   **Hoppy Copy**: Specializes in written copy for email newsletters, social posts, LinkedIn, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>.
*   **Image Generators (e.g., Midjourney)**: One of the most "magical" [[Use of AI in storytelling and content creation | AI tools]], allowing users to create high-quality images for thumbnails or illustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:41">[01:55:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>. The more flexible the prompt (focusing on a "vibe" rather than precise details), the better the results tend to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>. Referencing specific styles (e.g., "1700s painting") or artists (e.g., "Winslow Homer") can help achieve consistency across multiple images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:37">[02:03:37]</a>.

The post-production writing phase is particularly suited for AI, as content creators are often exhausted after producing the main piece of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05">[01:51:05]</a>. AI can save significant time on these "painful" tasks, even for skilled writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.

## AI as a Creative Catalyst

AI provides a "magic power" for creation, enabling individuals who previously lacked specific skills (like art or coding) to produce high-quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:27">[01:53:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:41">[01:55:41]</a>. This doesn't devalue traditional skills but allows millions of people to "start on first base," experiencing what it's like to create effectively without years of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:14">[02:04:14]</a>.

## The Future of Creation with AI

There is significant optimism that AI will lead to a world where more people can create more things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:35">[02:04:35]</a>. While there are [[The ethical considerations of using AI in content creation | ethical and legal considerations]] (e.g., training data), the relevance of human creatives is unlikely to diminish; they will become "benchmark and reference points" for others to build upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:59">[02:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:37">[02:05:37]</a>.

Rather than simply doing the same amount of work with less time and money, the historical pattern of human existence suggests that increased efficiency leads to the creation of *more* things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>. For example, if coding takes one-tenth of the time, the result will be ten times more coded projects, not one-tenth the number of coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:23">[02:06:23]</a>. This will lead to a more dynamic, interesting, and creative world, though it will also present new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>. The **[[impact_of_ai_on_learning | impact of AI on learning]]** new computing paradigms and building new products quickly is also significant, with tools like "Spiral" being built in just two months and costing minimal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:19">[02:12:19]</a>.

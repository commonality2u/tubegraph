The introduction of new technologies throughout history has often been met with fear and skepticism, a pattern observable from ancient times to the modern era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10"></a>. Examining past [[historical_parallels_in_technological_change | technological changes]] can provide insight into how societies react and adapt to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26"></a>.

## Early Reactions to New Technologies

Even the written word faced initial skepticism, as evidenced by remarks attributed to Socrates, although scholarly interpretations of these are debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51"></a>. A clearer example of societal apprehension toward a new technology is the advent of the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04"></a>.

### The Printing Press: Fears and Realities

When the printing press was introduced, the public discourse around it mirrored contemporary fears surrounding AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07"></a>. Concerns included:
*   The collapse of trust in human cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15"></a>.
*   Widespread misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22"></a>.
*   The erosion of the solidity of knowledge and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25"></a>.
*   Unpredictable and potentially destructive uses of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32"></a>.

Despite these fears, the long-term impact of the printing press proved profoundly beneficial:
*   It is indispensable for science, enabling the widespread dissemination of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45"></a>.
*   It facilitated widespread literacy and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50"></a>.
*   It supported the progress of knowledge and the growth of institutions like universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52"></a>.

However, the transition was not without challenges. The period following the printing press saw nearly a century of religious war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13"></a>. This demonstrates that while new technologies bring immense benefits, their transition periods can be very challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22"></a>. Society has some, though not total, control over how these transitions play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50"></a>. By learning from past transitions, societies can strive to minimize difficulties and foster a more compassionate and humane evolution towards the benefits of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09"></a>.

### The Dynamics of Technology Waves and Societal Impact

[[the_dynamics_of_technology_waves_and_their_societal_impact | The dynamics of technology waves]] often involve a common psychological reaction: fear of a perceived reduction in agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10"></a>. New technologies are frequently experienced as reducing the agency of key individuals, leaders, institutions, and society as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42"></a>.

In reality, agency often changes rather than simply diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13"></a>. For example, using a ride-sharing service like Uber might seem like a loss of agency because one is not driving, but it represents a gain in agency by providing transportation without car ownership or enabling safe travel after drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32"></a>.

Similarly, smartphones were initially argued by some to be "humanity-reducing" and a form of "cybernetic control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30"></a>. Yet, billions of people use them because they offer a massive increase in personal agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54"></a>. When millions of people experience an elevation in their individual agency due to a new technology, it can lead to collective "super agency" for individuals and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04"></a>.

This [[technological_influences_on_human_psychology | human perception and technology's impact]] is influenced by an internal, aesthetic sense of agency, not solely external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26"></a>. Approaching an external circumstance, including new technologies, with the mindset that it can transform, extend, and enhance one's agency leads to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54"></a>. Conversely, viewing it as agency-reducing can be self-defeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58"></a>. This perspective highlights how deeply intertwined [[the_evolution_and_influence_of_technology_on_the_human_sense_of_self | cultural and technological evolution]] are with [[human perception and technologys impact | human perception]] and one's [[cultural_impact_of_technology | sense of self]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50"></a>.

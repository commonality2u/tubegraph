Predicting the future of technology is challenging, as it is easy to make predictions, but difficult to make accurate ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This difficulty is evident in the uneven progress of various technological waves and their subsequent societal impacts.

## Early Experiences with Technology Waves

One significant example of a technology that developed slower than expected is Virtual Reality (VR). Jaron Lanier demonstrated VR in 1987, which was then a multi-million dollar technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite the initial "blown away" reaction and belief that it was "the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, the core technology hasn't changed dramatically, though the cost has dropped to around $100 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. The slow adoption of VR has been surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, with some suggesting it is "still waiting for its LLM moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, a technical breakthrough akin to what propelled AI forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. The challenge for VR lies in its reliance on biological factors, such as eye focusing and the weight of the headset, which introduce physical constraints that slow down development compared to purely digital advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

## The "Pioneer to Builder" Transition in Tech

The evolution of technology often involves a transition from a "pioneer" phase to a "builder" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This dynamic was described as moving from a "wild empty quarter" to a "new continent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This shift can be seen in historical contexts like the HBO show *Deadwood*, which depicted the transition from lawless mining towns to established order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Similarly, events like Burning Man have evolved from chaotic, unsupervised gatherings to more organized, regulated environments with streets and bureaucratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

While there is a "loss" of unconstrained freedom in this transition, the added layers of organization, structure, and governance ultimately lead to a better, more sustainable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. It is crucial to maintain zones for new frontiers where those suited to operating without many rules can thrive, alongside established centers where those who prefer discipline and structure can also succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This dual approach allows for continuous innovation and growth.

## Personal Approach to Frontiers

A personal strategy for engaging with the cutting edge of technology is to "visit the frontier" rather than residing there permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This involves spending time in remote, less developed areas, or engaging with new technologies like AI, but always returning to a more stable base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This balance is maintained by dividing time between grappling with the latest AI advancements and engaging in historical reading or hands-on workshop activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Effective predictors of the future are often also great historians, underscoring the importance of understanding the past to anticipate future trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This approach of considering both the "ephemeral frontier" and the "next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years" is key to navigating the dynamics of technological change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## [[Historical parallels in technological change | Historical Parallels]]: Electricity and Intelligence

To better understand current technological shifts like AI, drawing [[Historical parallels in technological change | parallels]] from history can be incredibly insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The early understanding of electricity provides a compelling analogy for the current state of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Just as early scientists like Isaac Newton were profoundly mistaken about the nature of electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, humanity remains largely ignorant about the true nature of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

Early theories about electricity included ideas like "phlogiston" or that it was primarily a biological phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The discovery that electricity could exist in a vacuum challenged prevailing theories and led to a deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This mirrors the current situation with AI, where numerous theories about intelligence abound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

### Understanding Intelligence: Compound vs. Element

It is hypothesized that intelligence is not a single element but rather a "compound" composed of various cognitive elements that have not yet been fully identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Similar to how salt is a compound of elements, current AI models might be "making some kind of salt" without fully understanding its constituent parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This idea aligns with Marvin Minsky's "society of mind" concept and the "mixture of experts" approach used in modern AIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

Human intelligence, from this perspective, is a "peculiar complex" of these cognitive elements, positioned at the "edge" of the possibility space of all possible minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. AI's role will be to create "hundreds of various other kinds" of intelligence, filling out this possibility space with diverse forms of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This means future intelligences may not always resemble human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Creative Work and Self-Expression

AI tools are transforming creative work, particularly writing, by facilitating the transition into "editing mode" much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. AI assists with overcoming initial creative blocks, structuring thoughts, and identifying areas of ignorance, acting as a valuable starting point for projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

A fascinating aspect of AI's impact is the rise of the "audience of one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. AI allows for highly personalized creative endeavors, such as generating entire fictional worlds, novels, or even feature-length movies, purely for the pleasure of the co-creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. This kind of creation, akin to Sunday painting or keeping a journal, serves as a form of self-expression and relaxation rather than a commercial venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.

The development of AI memory systems, like OpenAI's new feature that automatically accesses past chat history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>, is expected to lead to significant [[relationship_between_technology_and_personal_identity | emotional bonding]] between humans and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. People will form close, dependent relationships with these AI companions, using them in capacities that blur the lines with traditional therapy or companionship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

## Lessons from Past Predictions

Examining past predictions reveals common pitfalls in understanding technology waves:

*   **VR (Virtual Reality)**: Greatly overestimated its speed of adoption due to underestimating the biological and physical challenges involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.
*   **eBay**: Failed to see its broader utility beyond auctions, which was its initial focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. eBay's success largely came from users moving beyond the auction format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Blockchain**: Missed its trajectory to become primarily a store of value and financial instrument, expecting it to be used more for non-financial applications and micropayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. The unforeseen processing costs and the overwhelming influence of money diverted its expected path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

These examples underscore that making predictions about the future is easy, but making true predictions is hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

## Future Outlook: The Physicality Challenge

The challenges faced by VR in widespread adoption highlight a broader issue: the physicality of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. The need for efficient power consumption and the difficulty of compressing complex systems to human-body scale mean that the arrival of advanced robots will likely take "a lot lot lot longer than people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. While AI has seen a "50-year overnight success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>, overcoming the physical limitations in robotics presents a much larger gap to bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

Robin Sloan, bestselling author of *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, *Sourdough*, and *Moonbound*, initially set out to write a book *with* AI, but ultimately wrote *about* AI instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This shift in focus was influenced by his extensive experimentation with [[Use of AI in Writing and Investment | language models]] and the insights he gained from their capabilities and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Initial Intent vs. Reality

Sloan began tinkering with early forms of [[Use of AI in Writing and Investment | language models]] in 2016-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. At that time, people were feeding entire corpora like Shakespeare into models to generate text, which, while basic by today's standards, was considered impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

He found two appealing aspects of this early era:
*   The output was "really weird" and "messed up," which was aesthetically and poetically interesting because it was broken and inhuman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   The smaller scale allowed individual users to consider what data they would train the models on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Sloan experimented by training models on large swaths of public domain fantasy and science fiction, finding the output evocative and surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

This experimentation led him to create one of the first text editors where a writer could work alongside an AI model, completing sentences with a tab key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. His goal was to develop and use these tools for a new way of writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

Despite the significant advancements in AI technology, Sloan discovered that the experience of [[The Creative Process in Writing with AI | creative writing with the machine]] was not enjoyable for him, and the results did not meet his desired standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. He found himself more interested in compulsively tinkering with the machines themselves rather than writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. As a result, his book *Moonbound* contains no AI-written text but is "packed full of these ideas and and actually some of these feelings" gleaned from time spent with the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### [[Challenges and benefits of AIassisted writing | Challenges of AI-Assisted Creative Writing]]

Sloan's experience with a capable Google model called Lambda highlighted the limitations of [[Enhancing the writing process with AI tools | AI tools for creative writing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. While the models were impressive at fitting into a style or mode, the output was "always close but never quite exactly right" for high-end fictional composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. He found that the AI "didn't get what I'm doing here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

Sloan theorizes that really good writing exists at the "edge of that probability Cloud" of content, and often pushes beyond it, which is precisely where [[Role of AI in creative work | language models are weakest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

He also expresses reservations about fine-tuning current "super models" on his own preferred authors because the base models have been trained on "everything ever written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. The sheer scale of these training corpora makes them unreadable and uncheckable by a person, meaning even the makers don't fundamentally know all that's contained within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. This "not knowing" makes him uneasy for content that will convey "thoughts and feelings and ideas" in fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.

> [21:35:00] I would feel so uncomfortable putting people in front of a product or artifact or whatever you call it where on some fundamental level I did not know what it was gonna say.

Sloan suggests that "ethically raised, organic AI" might be coming, where origins are disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>.

## The Inspiration: Ideas Gleaned from AI

Despite the challenges of *using* AI for creative writing, Sloan found the *machines themselves* to be "super duper interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

### Embedding Spaces and the "Bagel" Dimension

One profound early idea for Sloan came from Stanford research that packed sentences into an embedding space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. In this high-dimensional space, sentences could "Crossfade" meaningfully, demonstrating how "language could get mapped into math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

> [00:00:06] The idea that language could get mapped into math in this way was just so freaking cool I just found it so evocative.

This concept of mapping text onto a multi-dimensional map where closer things are closer in meaning directly inspired a passage in *Moonbound*, where characters swim through a many-dimensional space with a "Bagel" dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. This idea is paralleled by real-world research, such as Anthropic's work on pulling out specific features within language models, like a "Golden Gate Bridge feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

### Language as Autonomous Entity

Sloan is "quite taken with the claim that what [[Use of AI in storytelling and content creation | language models]] are is language itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. He views them as language "given its first dose of autonomy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, almost like "you rip language out of our head and it starts walking around like wind up toys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. He finds these models to be "such amazing artifacts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, inspiring science fiction stories even in their current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Core Themes in "Moonbound" Inspired by AI

### The Question "What Happens Next?"

A central theme in *Moonbound* is the "irresistible question... what happens next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>. This echoes how [[Automating repetitive writing with AI | language models]] operate by predicting the next token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>. Sloan notes that early [[Use of AI in Writing and Investment | language models]], trained on narratives like news articles and stories, inherently had a bias towards "if then, cause and effect and the rhythm of a story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>. However, the inclusion of vast amounts of code in later training datasets has significantly impacted AI's language use, potentially affecting their "reasoning" given code's structured and consequential nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>.

### The Nature of "I"

Sloan explores the concept of "I" (the self) in *Moonbound*, featuring characters like a chronicler who is a "fungus unto which much technology has been layered" and Clovis, a robot with many instances but a single personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:00">[41:37:00]</a>. This exploration draws from the diverse ways different human languages and even modern life (e.g., internet presence) conceptualize the "I" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. He connects this to [[Use of AI in storytelling and content creation | language models]], which predict the next word by discerning "which version of that word is it" based on previous context, creating a "dictionary of these very very very specific words" that are used in countless ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:09:00">[46:09:00]</a>.

### Dreams and Language Models

Sloan proposes a "pet theory" that the mechanism of dreaming is very similar to that of a [[Role of AI in creative work | language model]] continuing a sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:51:00">[49:51:00]</a>. He suggests that novels are "packaged dreams," offering a way to "load a waking dream into your head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:21:00">[50:21:00]</a>. This leads to a "trilateral connection between books and dreams and language models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:00">[50:42:00]</a>. He also muses on the biological necessity of sleep for all living things and wonders if a similar "analogical thing" will be determined as crucial for AI's long-term success or health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:23:00">[51:23:00]</a>.

## Reflections and Future Questions

Sloan believes that the existence of [[Use of AI in Writing and Investment | language models]] should prompt scholars, especially linguists and philosophers, to re-evaluate long-standing projects and fundamental questions about language, knowledge, and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>. He notes that while AI companies focus on infrastructure, scaling, and safety, the deeper philosophical questions are equally important for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:06:00">[47:06:00]</a>.

The realm of [[developing_ai_products_with_user_feedback | AI product development]] is characterized by a search for "new experiences" and "things that surprise you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This pursuit extends beyond merely making existing solutions faster, aiming instead for novel, intuitive solutions.

## Investing in AI Innovation

A common analogy used to describe innovation posits three types:
1.  **Faster Horses** Making an existing thing go faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Most current AI funding is going towards "faster horses" solutions, often churned out by the B2B SaaS industrial machine of venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. These solutions may be "arbitraged out of existence in like four years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
2.  **Teleportation** A desired outcome that doesn't yet have a clear path to existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Examples include self-driving cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
3.  **Japanese Toilets** Products or experiences that users didn't know they needed until they encountered them, after which they become indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These are often subtle in execution but provide a profound new experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The focus in AI product development should be on finding these "Japanese toilets of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Granola: A "Japanese Toilet" of AI

Granola, an AI notetaker, is cited as an example of a "Japanese Toilet" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Despite being one of "the 50,000th AI notetaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, its intuitive design and seamless integration with existing workflows (like appearing as Apple Notes and subtly enhancing notes) make it a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, contrasting sharply with more interruptive AI notetakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Qualities of Successful AI Product Builders

Founders who create "Japanese Toilet" products exhibit specific qualities:
*   **Insight from Customer Behavior** They tell "insightful reasons why they put things into the product that you would have never normally thought of from customer development calls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This involves "listening very, very closely to the behavior of what's happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Sensitivity and Movement** Such founders possess both "kinetic energy" (a proclivity to move fast) and "sensitivity" (an ability to listen closely and feel changes in patterns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. They "will move but they will move while still listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Comfort with Ambiguity** They are comfortable "wandering in the wilderness to find the thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, rather than trying to "plow through the problem" with pure horsepower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of AI Product Development

### Writing is Building, Software is Content
The [[developing_apps_and_prototypes_using_ai | AI age blurs the line between a writer and a builder]] because "you can code in English" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This means that "writing is building" and "software is now content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. This new paradigm allows for rapid creation; for example, an app can be made in 15 minutes while waiting for a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Organizations like Every are structured to leverage this, with staff who "write articles," "write code by like writing prompts," and have significant overlap between roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### The Agentic Spectrum for [[developing_ai_products_with_user_feedback | Developing AI products with user feedback]]
When [[developing_ai_products_with_user_feedback | developing AI products with user feedback]], a crucial consideration is the "agentic spectrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>, which defines "how long are they allowed to work before they ask for feedback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Short Leash (e.g., Microsoft Co-pilot):** Attempts to complete one line of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Long Leash (e.g., Devon):** Aims to run independently for several hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>, though it may be too slow or prone to breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Optimized Leash (e.g., Replit agents):** Hits the right "time variance" before asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>, making it effective for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

The "altitude of reasoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a> a model operates at is critical. AI products should consider whether to zoom right into a solution or first provide broader context and options to the user, like offering different decision theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

#### Example: Wordware
Wordware, an AI tool, is designed to enable anyone to be a maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. Instead of a chat interface, it presents a blank document where users write down what they want built in plain English, akin to a long email to an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. This approach encourages users to provide more context, which is beneficial for the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. It's currently ideal for "slightly technical" users who understand concepts like inputs, outputs, and 'if/then' statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_benefits_of_integrating_ai_into_product_development | Challenges and Benefits of AI Integration]]

### Trust in AI Outputs
A key challenge is trusting AI outputs, especially when managing an intelligence to do work one isn't qualified for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. Directly asking "are you sure?" can bias the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. Instead, techniques like asking for "confidence intervals and pluses and minuses" or a "reason why you could be right and give me a reason why you could be wrong" can provide better insight into the model's logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. Generally, models are better at evaluating objective logic than subjective reads like writing quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

### The Future of Work and Teams
[[building_ai_products_with_lean_teams | AI allows for leaner teams]] and faster iteration cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. The ability to "code so quickly and make so quickly" means individuals can undertake numerous projects simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This leads to a shift where more people on a team are "making the core decisions" and less are involved in mere "execution" or "whittling the wood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>, which was once considered "craft" but is now covered by software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Example: Board Game Library Project
> An example of AI's efficiency is the development of a private board game library. AI assisted with:
> *   Analyzing lease drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
> *   Coding a demand model from a floor plan and persona analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.
> *   Building custom software for membership management, allowing voice commands to check availability and book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

This increased efficiency means early-stage companies can manage multiple products, like three products and a media product, at a high level with a relatively small team of generalists who have "special power tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Looking Ahead: New Opportunities in AI

Future opportunities lie in developing AI that operates at a higher "altitude" of reasoning, not just providing direct solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.
*   **Applying Best Practices:** Leveraging existing "books about best practices" and "academic literature" in various fields (e.g., therapy) to inform AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. This requires translating structured knowledge into "model language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Beyond Explicit Knowledge:** AI models can learn "sub-symbolic rules" from high-quality interactions, transferring knowledge that is difficult to verbalize or make explicit between humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. This creates "new knowledge that's being created even if we can't describe it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **User Control over Knowledge Navigation:** Enabling users to choose their preferred approach or "modality" of knowledge, rather than the AI automatically picking one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. For example, a startup advisor AI could present multiple decision theories and walk the user through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. This allows users to "explore within reason" before diving deep into a specific answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

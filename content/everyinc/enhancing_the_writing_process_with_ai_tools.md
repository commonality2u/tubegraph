The process of [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | writing]] can be broken down into four key areas: taste, topic, craft, and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. AI tools can be integrated into each of these phases to [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_tools | enhance productivity]] and [[enhancing_creativity_and_idea_development_with_ai | creativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Taste: Defining Good Writing

Taste is defined as the ability to articulate why something is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. For a writer, understanding one's taste is crucial to producing quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Using AI to Define Personal Taste
One effective method to define personal writing taste involves using AI models like Claude or ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
The process is as follows:
1.  **List Preferred Writers**: Compile a list of authors whose work you admire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
2.  **Ask AI for "Vibes"**: Input the list into an AI (e.g., Claude) with a prompt like "Here are a list of writers I like, can you tell me the Vibes of these writers in detail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. AI models are particularly adept at capturing stylistic "vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
3.  **Synthesize Results**: Request the AI to synthesize these "vibes" into a more compact summary, such as a five-sentence description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
4.  **Iterate for Refinement**: Re-run the prompt multiple times or ask the AI to "make it better" to explore different ways of describing the writing styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

This exercise provides an articulated self-understanding, allowing writers to consciously aim for specific qualities in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. It can help confirm existing inclinations, leading to a sense of comfort and confidence in one's chosen writing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Expanding Taste Beyond Writing
AI can help diversify artistic influences beyond just written works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. By providing a list of favorite authors, an AI can recommend movies or other art forms with similar "vibes," helping writers discover new, informing influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. This cross-medium exploration allows for a more well-rounded artistic taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

> [!tip] Practical Application
> Once taste is articulated, it serves as a mental checklist during the editing phase. Writers can assess if their work aligns with their desired qualities, such as accessibility, depth, or thoughtfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

## Topic: Discovering What to Write About

Choosing a topic is a crucial first step in [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | writing]]. While some writers find ideas through non-AI methods like subconscious bubbling after a 'brain dump' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, AI offers structured approaches to [[enhancing_creativity_and_idea_development_with_ai | enhancing creativity and idea development]].

### AI for Idea Generation and Refinement
*   **Voice Memo Transcription**: Record thoughts while walking and talking, then transcribe the voice memo using tools like Whisper. The transcript can then be fed into Claude or ChatGPT to extract interesting ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.
*   **Interactive Brainstorming**: Engage directly with ChatGPT's advanced voice mode for a conversation. Brainstorm freely, and then ask the AI to reflect on what it hears, helping to identify potential rabbit holes or topics for deeper exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Thesis Statement Refinement**: For longer, research-heavy pieces, maintain a comprehensive note file (e.g., in Notion). Regularly feed these notes into an AI model (like Claude's projects feature) and ask it to generate a thesis statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. This iterative process of generating, critiquing, and refining thesis statements helps distill a complex morass of ideas into a concise, accurate, and interesting core argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

### Consensus for Research and Fundamentals
For understanding underlying fundamentals of a topic, especially scientific or industry-specific ones, tools like Consensus (an LLM mixed with Google Scholar) are invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.
*   **Identify Core Questions**: Use Consensus to answer fundamental questions related to a news item or spark of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Synthesize Research**: Its co-pilot summary feature can distill key insights from multiple academic papers, helping writers quickly grasp the current consensus on a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. This allows writers to become "95% of the depth of most experts" by reading just a few relevant papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   **Expand Scope**: This tool broadens the range of topics a writer can confidently address by rapidly accelerating the research process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.

## Craft: The Act of Writing and Editing

[[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects | Using AI tools for creative projects]] can significantly streamline the [[the_creative_process_in_writing_with_ai | writing]] and editing phases.

### AI in Drafting and Summarization
*   **Drafting Support**: Tools like Lex (a Google Docs-like editor with AI baked in) can instantly generate generic explanatory text for concepts a writer already understands but doesn't want to labor over. For example, Lex can write about "Plato's theory of forms" in a few sentences, allowing the writer to maintain flow and return later for personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Contextual Expansion**: Within Lex, highlighting notes and asking the AI to expand on them in comments can provide examples or structured paragraphs, reducing friction in getting specific details or arguments down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.

### AI for Editing and Custom Prompts
*   **Overcoming Writer's Block**: For common struggles, such as writing conclusions, AI chatbots can generate multiple options. Even if the initial suggestions are "wrong," articulating *why* they are wrong helps clarify what *is* right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
*   **Custom Prompts**: Create "Prompt Builders" (e.g., in Claude) for recurring tasks. These can include a system prompt (instructions and reference articles for tone/voice) and an automated first message from the AI. This [[automating_repetitive_writing_tasks_with_AI | automates repetitive writing tasks]] like generating conclusions in a specific style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.
*   **Automated Checks**: AI can perform rote editing tasks, such as checking for passive voice, improving the overall cleanliness of a draft before it reaches a human editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. This allows human editors to focus on higher-level feedback, leading to better final quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Metaphors and Analogies**: AI can assist in developing metaphors and analogies by suggesting options or weaving in specific quotes/notes from your collected research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. This collaborative process can lead to powerful, central metaphors that a writer might not have conceived independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Audience: Reaching People

AI tools are increasingly important for distribution and audience engagement, especially in the context of algorithmically driven platforms.

### Content Transformation with Spiral
Spiral, an AI application, specializes in content transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. It functions as a "pipe designer" that takes one body of text and transforms it into another format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
*   **Format Adaptation**: Writers constantly translate core creative work into different formats (e.g., essays into headlines, tweets, or LinkedIn posts; podcast transcripts into show notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>. This is done to reach specific audiences on different platforms, with varying attention spans and format expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Automation of Repetitive Tasks**: Much of this content transformation is repetitive and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. Spiral, powered by AI (e.g., Claude), can [[automating_repetitive_writing_with_ai | automate a lot of this work]], getting writers 80% of the way there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.
*   **Increased Output and Engagement**: By significantly reducing the effort required for content adaptation (e.g., turning an article into a tweet in five minutes instead of 30-40 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>, writers can publish more frequently, leading to increased engagement and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations in AI-Assisted Distribution
The use of AI in content transformation raises [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | ethical challenges]], particularly concerning plagiarism and attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Attribution**: When transforming external content, it's crucial to cite the original source clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>. Summarizing information for a new audience is generally acceptable, as long as it's not wholesale lifting without attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>.
*   **New Ethics**: The rapid evolution of AI necessitates new ethical guidelines for content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. While tools for detecting AI generation are emerging, the focus needs to be on whether sentences or ideas originate from somewhere else without proper citation, rather than merely if they are AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

### AI as Algorithm and Filter
Beyond content generation, AI plays a crucial role in distribution as algorithmic selection powers most online platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. Writers must consider how their content will engage these algorithms to maximize reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>. AI models, though not perfect, are the first tools built to effectively navigate the "sea of garbage" and information overload online, helping writers and readers find relevant content more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

AI tools offer significant advantages across all stages of the [[writing_with_and_about_ai | writing process]], from understanding personal taste and choosing topics to drafting, editing, and distributing content. While there are [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | challenges and ethical considerations]], the ongoing co-evolution of humans and technology suggests a future where AI continues to enhance human creativity and efficiency in writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.

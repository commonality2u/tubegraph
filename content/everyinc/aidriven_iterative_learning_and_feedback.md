Nicholas, a general partner at the incubator Prehype, has leveraged AI extensively to revolutionize the process of incubating companies, demonstrating a model of [[Iterative Development with AI | AI-driven iterative development]] and customer feedback integration. His work at Prehype has led to the incubation of over 50 startups, including well-known names like BarkBox, Row, U.com, For them, Ferry, and Headway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Problem of Getting Started
Historically, helping entrepreneurs launch a company involved a lengthy process of understanding business ideas, framing them consistently, finding and interviewing potential customers, synthesizing feedback, and building early momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This often meant only being able to help a few people a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. A significant gap exists between people who have business ideas (60-65%) and feel they have the resources to act on them, versus the small percentage (8%) who actually start a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This "lossy" process often stems from not knowing where to start or having too many competing ideas to make progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

## Autos: An AI-Native Incubation Platform
Nicholas co-founded Autos, a company designed to streamline and accelerate the business incubation process using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The goal is to help customers go from zero to a functioning business as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. With AI, this process now takes approximately three days on average, a drastic reduction from the months it once took, or the times when it wouldn't happen at all due to skill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Autos is experiencing high demand, with thousands of people interested in its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### End-to-End AI Integration
Autos embodies a "GPT all the way down" approach:
*   **Business Building:** ChatGPT assists in building the core business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Product Development:** The product itself leverages the GPT API to serve customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Customer Empowerment:** Customers use ChatGPT or the GPT API to build their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

This maximalist use of AI allows Autos to operate as an "AI-native" entity, both in its internal capabilities and in its customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### The Autos Customer Journey
The customer journey through Autos is highly automated and [[Developing AI products with user feedback | driven by AI]]:
1.  **Initial Engagement:** The process primarily starts through an Instagram DM bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This channel was chosen due to Facebook's product for direct conversation acquisition, making it easy to "talk to your customers" persistently without requiring new app installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Ads are run to initiate conversations, prompting users to engage with the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
2.  **Customer Definition & Problem Framing:** The AI anchors the conversation by requesting the entrepreneur to define their target customer by name and then asks about that customer's unmet needs or wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This precision helps in formulating a problem statement and guides the AI in proposing solutions across various business models (e.g., software, platform, physical product, financial product, content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
3.  **Automated Pitch Deck Generation:** After a few questions, the AI automatically generates a comprehensive pitch deck within five to six minutes, assuming GPT-4 isn't backed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. This deck includes:
    *   Contextual slides for the problem and customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
    *   A restated problem statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
    *   Iconography and branding concepts, including an automatically generated logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   Proposed business names based on the "heroes" of the target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
    *   Color palettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
    *   A user journey and solution framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
    *   Key benefits and pricing suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
    *   Market size analysis (by running Google searches for data) and a to-do list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
    This automated deck helps founders quickly see their ideas come to life, providing crucial validation and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. Users can provide feedback and edit elements like icons and pitches, leading to regeneration of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
4.  **Customer Feedback & Lead Generation Tools:** For a $30 payment, customers move to the next step, which involves tools for gathering feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
    *   **Landing Page & Domain:** An automatically generated landing page, using assets and copy from the deck, is created for the business idea. The system even registers a domain for the entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
    *   **Custom AI Co-pilot:** Each entrepreneur receives their own hosted GPT that can acquire and qualify leads, similar to how Autos acquires its own customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. This AI can chat with potential customers, qualify them, and begin selling them on the product vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
    *   **Ad Campaign Assets:** Autos also provides assets to help entrepreneurs run their own ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
    *   **Voice-Oriented Customer Interview Tool:** Users are prompted to interview themselves or share a voice-oriented chat tool with friends and potential customers to collect feedback. This tool follows a "need-finding playbook" to deeply explore the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
    *   **Automated Product Roadmap:** All collected conversations are synthesized into a product roadmap, identifying key features and organizing them in a dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

## Building with AI: The Non-Coder's Approach
Nicholas emphasizes that he has no computer science background and never programmed extensively before ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. ChatGPT has revolutionized his ability to "write code" that functions and delivers results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

His process for [[The shift from traditional coding to AIdriven development | AI-driven development]] relies heavily on iterative interaction with ChatGPT:
1.  **Desired Output First:** Start by defining the desired output (e.g., code, color palette description, JSON object) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
2.  **Iterative Scripting:** For coding tasks, he pastes existing scripts (often from Airtable, his prototyping environment) into ChatGPT, describes desired changes, and then pastes error messages back into the AI until the script works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. This "paste the error message" approach allows non-technical users to debug and refine code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.
3.  **API Integration:** For connecting to third-party services, he pastes API documentation into ChatGPT and asks it to format the necessary calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.
4.  **Script Generation:** Finally, he requests ChatGPT to write the full script that can be run in Airtable (or later, Superbase) to automate tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.

This workflow highlights [[The role of meta skills in an AIdriven coding environment | AI's capability to bridge the gap between natural language and machine-readable information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. Airtable acts as a "source of truth" database with scripting capabilities, allowing for rapid prototyping and connecting to various services like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. Once a function is proven, it can be "productionized" into more robust systems like Superbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.

## Implications for Entrepreneurship and Creativity
This model of AI-driven development empowers individuals to create functional prototypes and services quickly, reducing the reliance on complex UI/UX design or large development teams in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. It allows founders to stay closer to their customers by directly building first drafts and iteratively refining products based on direct feedback, rather than getting bogged down in organizational overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

AI acts as an "amazing force multiplier" for entrepreneurial and creative expression, helping individuals make things in service of others. It promises to push entrepreneurship to new heights by enabling more people to transform ideas into tangible projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

For more information, Nicholas's book, "Me, My Customer, and AI," will document this thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Autos can be found via autos.com, which redirects to their Instagram page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

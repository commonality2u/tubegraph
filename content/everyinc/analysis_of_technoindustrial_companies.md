Packy McCormick, founder of Not Boring and Not Boring Capital, is known for his essays and analysis of tech, focusing on [[finding_big_ideas_in_tech | finding big ideas]] and identifying key trends shaping the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. His work, which reaches about 200,000 email subscribers, has established him as a significant voice in the current tech era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. McCormick's current focus revolves around "techno industrial" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Defining TechnoIndustrial Companies

McCormick describes "techno industrial" companies as a re-obsession with vertically integrated businesses, a concept he first explored in his early writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. These are often "big complex beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> that, if successful, yield strong business models and significant societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Characteristics

TechnoIndustrial companies are characterized by:
*   **Integrated Product Delivery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>: They deliver a product for which there is already substantial demand, but they do so "better, cheaper, and at higher margins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment in Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>: The higher margins allow for reinvestment into research and development (R&D) and overall growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Software Infusion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>: A key element is the integration of software into hardware solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

### Distinction from Deep Tech or Frontier Tech

McCormick differentiates "techno industrial" from "deep tech" or "frontier tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. While deep tech companies focus on scientific projects and inventing things that have never existed before, carrying significant scientific risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, techno industrials operate at a stage *beyond* this invention. They integrate existing inventions into a cohesive product delivery system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### Examples of TechnoIndustrial Companies

*   **Anduril** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>: Described as a prime example, Anduril uses a different approach to defense by creating "smaller, cheaper, moreable hardware" infused with software to offer a better product to the government at improved prices and margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:07]</a>.
*   **SpaceX** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>: Kicked off the "hard tech revolution" and generated a talent diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Fuse Energy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>: Involved in radiation effects testing and fusion energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Earth AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>: A mining company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Boeing**: Mentioned as an incumbent company that "someone should replace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## The "Why Now" for TechnoIndustrials

Several factors contribute to the current relevance and impact of techno industrial companies:
*   **Fundability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>: These types of companies are now "fundable again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **[[The influence of risk profiles and innovation in AIdriven companies | AI]]'s Role** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>: [[The influence of risk profiles and innovation in AIdriven companies | AI]] is considered one of the significant driving forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting Public Sentiment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>: For example, there's a shift in public opinion regarding nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing vs. Construction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>: A growing belief that large-scale projects, like gigawatt nuclear reactors, should transition from being construction endeavors to manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Sclerosis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>: There is a perceived "sclerosis among the incumbents" in various industries, creating opportunities for new companies to emerge and offer superior solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   **[[Historical parallels in technological change | Technological Walls]] and Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>: Similar to [[historical_parallels_in_technological_change | past eras of oil development and mining]], industries reach a technological "wall" where it becomes harder and more expensive to discover new resources (e.g., rare metals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. This creates a need for innovation to access the next level of resources and make previously uneconomical processes viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Software Infusion into Hardware** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>: This is considered the overarching trend driving the rise of these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

## Analyzing Complex Businesses with AI

McCormick leverages AI tools, particularly Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Projects, to analyze these complex businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. His process involves:
*   **Information Dump** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>: Importing all notes, company materials, analyst reports, and relevant blog posts into Claude Projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. This centralizes all research, which would typically be organized in a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Questioning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>: Asking the AI specific questions while writing, such as "Is there any interesting data anywhere that I should be using?" or "Are there quotes from X, Y, and Z investors that might be useful here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Memo Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>: Submitting full investment memos to the AI and asking if anything important is missing or if an LP would poke holes in the thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. This contextual analysis is highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>.
*   **Summarization and Idea Generation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>: AI significantly reduces the time spent on summarizing complex ideas, allowing more time for deeper thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:44]</a>. It can also help explore different angles for explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Referencing Ideas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>: AI can identify whether a seemingly novel idea has been explored by others, saving time and potential embarrassment for writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>.
*   **Interactive Visualizations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>: McCormick uses AI to generate simple code for interactive elements, such as a vector graph illustrating the combined effect of government and entrepreneurship on progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>. This allows for new forms of content representation beyond traditional writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Appetite Visualization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>: For an article on America's risk tolerance, AI was used to assign risk scores to different historical periods and visualize them as a graph, providing a quick rough guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Code Explanation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[38:41:00]</a>: For technical articles, AI can explain complex code (e.g., nuclear reactor design code) and predict outcomes of parameter changes, aiding understanding without requiring specialized engineering knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:48:00">[38:48:00]</a>.

While useful, McCormick notes that [[the_influence_of_risk_profiles_and_innovation_in_aidriven_companies | AI]] as an editor can be overly defensive or overemphasize counterarguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>, sometimes leading to ideas being "watered down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. Despite these quirks, the speed and contextual understanding provided by AI are invaluable for his research and writing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:00">[43:07:00]</a>.

</div>
The AI editor, particularly Claude, often starts with an "A minus" grade, and even with direct prompts for accuracy, tends to stick to a positive but not perfect assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:29:00">[58:29:00]</a>. This suggests an inherent "attractor state" towards an A-minus grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

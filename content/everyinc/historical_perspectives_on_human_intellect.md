The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly tools like ChatGPT, has brought about an emotional roller coaster, challenging humanity's long-held conception of itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Historically, the difference between humans and animals has been defined by the intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Defining the Intellect Through History

This intellectual distinction dates back 2,000 years to Aristotle, who asserted that "the life of the intellect is the best and the pleasantest for man, for the intellect more than anything else is man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Two millennia later, playwright and short story writer Anton Chekhov echoed this sentiment in his novella *Ward No. 6*, stating that "the intellect draws a sharp line between animals and man and suggests the divinity of the latter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

This perspective has become even more salient as economies have shifted from industrial labor to [[knowledge_work|knowledge work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If human self-worth is defined by what is known, then the capabilities of [[philosophical_perspectives_on_truth_and_language_models|language models]] can appear threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The idea that AI can "write and worse think" raises questions about what remains unique to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## The Intellect as a Fuzzy Concept

For the purposes of understanding AI's impact, the intellect can be loosely defined as "that thing that humans uniquely have that animals don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This fuzzy definition reflects the threatening aspect of AI, as it encroaches on what is considered uniquely human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. In reality, the intellect is a vast combination of different brain processes lumped under a single heading, making it easier to define by what it is *not* (via negativa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For millennia, humanity has defined its sense of self by this amorphous set of processes called the intellect, and AI's capabilities threaten to replace this defining characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Redefining Intellect: Lessons from Psychology and Technology

To regain a sense of self in an [[application_and_implications_of_ai_in_the_context_of_human_intelligence|AI-driven world]], it's necessary to redefine intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This process of redefining fuzzy concepts is not new and can be informed by historical examples where [[technological_influences_on_human_psychology|technology has helped differentiate previously overlapping ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Pharmacological Dissection: Lithium and Mental Illness

Psychology contains many fuzzy concepts without clear boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For instance, until the 1960s, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were considered related and caused by similar underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. However, the drug lithium, which treats bipolar disorder but not schizophrenia, helped differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

In the late 1940s, Dr. J.F. Cade discovered that the urine of manic patients was toxic to guinea pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He found these patients had elevated uric acid levels and hypothesized this caused the toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In an experiment, he dissolved uric acid in a lithium carbonate solution to inject it into guinea pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Unexpectedly, the guinea pigs became remarkably calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Cade then decided to inject the lithium carbonate solution into his manic patients, and the results were astounding: lithium resolved their mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

This discovery revolutionized psychology, not only by providing a treatment for hundreds of thousands of people but also by enabling what psychiatrist Peter Kramer termed a "pharmacological dissection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Lithium helped to pull apart manic depression from other mental illnesses, as it uniquely treated bipolar disorder, carving it out as a separate condition with a biological cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Technological Dissection: ChatGPT and Summarization

ChatGPT can similarly serve as a "lever" to provide a "new lens" on understanding the intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Technically, ChatGPT performs "next token prediction," excelling at predicting subsequent words in a sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. In practice, this means language models are adept at reformatting and reconstituting existing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Cognitive scientist Alison Gopnik views [[philosophical_approaches_to_change|language models]] as "technologies that enhance cultural transmission" and "powerful and efficient imitation engines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. She sees them as extensions of previous technological revolutions, such as the written word, the [[historical_perspectives_on_technology_like_the_printing_press|printing press]], and the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. These technologies facilitate the efficient transmission of existing information, increasing human coordination and driving cultural evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

ChatGPT's strength lies not in discovering new things, but in taking the sum total of existing human knowledge and presenting it in the correct format for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Its ability to transmit known information into the right context surpasses any prior innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Simply put, ChatGPT is a powerful summarizer, essential because the sheer volume of human knowledge currently exceeds individual capacity to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

By reframing ChatGPT as primarily a summarizer, individuals can redefine their understanding of the intellect. The speaker found that much of their own work, from emails to articles and code, involves summarizing existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. While this might initially cause dread about AI's role, it highlights that many other non-summarizing tasks are part of creative work, such as life experiences, emotional experiences, and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Summarizing, while learned out of necessity, is not inherently core to one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

This leads to "subtracting summarizing" as a skill central to the intellect or sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Instead of being replaced, humans can become the "editor or the manager" of summaries, directing and evaluating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This shift allows for greater efficiency and highlights other valuable, non-summarizing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. ChatGPT, in this sense, acts as a "lever that becomes a new lens" on oneself and the world, changing how individuals perceive their intellect and role in the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Broader Historical Context: Technology's Role in Shaping Human Identity

This adaptation of self-definition is part of human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Human self-definition is adaptable, flexible, and changeable, making humans inherently flexible and adaptable beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

This phenomenon has occurred before. In *The Weirdest People in the World*, Joseph Henrich recounts the story of William Buckley, an English bricklayer and convict sent to an Australian penal colony in 1803 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Buckley escaped into the Australian wilderness, and while his friends perished, he survived by being adopted by an Aboriginal tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Henrich uses this story to illustrate how human beings change in response to their culture and surrounding technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Despite being genetically similar to the Aboriginal tribe, Buckley and his friends, coming from a modern culture, lacked the beliefs, norms, and ideas necessary to survive in that different environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The Aboriginal people, however, possessed "cultural technologies" that enabled them to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Henrich argues that humans have evolved brains that effectively learn the ideas, beliefs, values, motivations, and practices needed to survive in their ecological niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Culture dramatically accelerates this problem-solving ability, and crucially, "culture rewires our brains and alters our biology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Essentially, human psychology, brains, bodies, and biology are shaped by culture, which in turn is largely shaped by [[technological_influences_on_human_psychology|technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Adaptability of Human Identity

ChatGPT is the latest in a long line of cultural and technological advances that have changed what it means to be human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. AI is already influencing human biology without requiring direct brain-computer interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. While jobs primarily focused on summarizing may change or cease to exist, impacting individuals, this doesn't fundamentally alter the underlying sense of self or what makes humans unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The concept of the intellect can remain intact, albeit slightly changed, in an [[impact_of_ai_on_human_intellect|AI-driven world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

Sarah Tavel, a partner at Benchmark, focuses on applying lessons from previous consumer technology cycles to understand the current AI wave and discern what products will succeed or fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>. Her background includes early involvement at Pinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a> and a philosophy degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

## Evolution of Founder Archetypes in Tech Cycles

Historically, major consumer web hits like Google were founded by deeply technical teams, where the product's magic largely occurred on the backend, simplifying complex technology for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. As underlying technology matured, the emphasis shifted from deep technical expertise to product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. This continuum saw companies like Facebook, which had more technical depth than predecessors like Friendster or MySpace, winning due to performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. Later, companies such as Pinterest, Snap, and Instagram were led by non-technical CEOs who were "product geniuses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>.

The current major consumer AI wins, such as ChatGPT and Character AI, are seen as highly similar to early Google in their deeply technical, backend-focused nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:02">[03:59:02]</a>. OpenAI, a research lab, unintentionally created a massive consumer product, mirroring Google's initial DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:06">[05:01:06]</a>. Investing in PhDs doing long-term research is typically not a common [[Venture capital decisionmaking and AI | venture capital decision-making]] strategy, but it can be highly lucrative during a truly new technology paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>.

For product geniuses to truly build on top of AI, the underlying infrastructure needs to become more stable and mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:27">[04:39:27]</a>. Currently, users often need to employ complex "custom instructions" to get desired outputs from models, indicating that the technology is still early and not yet optimized for mass user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:29">[06:08:29]</a>. The cost of running models has also been high, though advancements like DeepSeek could change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:03">[09:16:03]</a>. The shift to product genius-led companies is driven by the need for more accessible tooling and infrastructure that allows less technical individuals to leverage AI, and the ultimate goal is to create the most engaging product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:05">[10:09:05]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on venture capital decisionmaking | Impact of AI on Venture Capital Decision-Making]]

AI is expected to significantly change the day-to-day operations and funding models within the venture capital industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

### Personalized AI for Decision-Making

AI could help VCs make better investment decisions by analyzing past choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:15">[04:22:15]</a>. Sarah Tavel maintains a "premortem" record for every company she evaluates, noting pros, cons, and investment outcomes, which allows her to examine her [[Venture capital decisionmaking and AI | decision-making process]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:21">[04:06:21]</a>. This data could be fed into an LLM to cross-examine a VC's thinking, potentially leading to better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:43">[04:29:43]</a>. For example, learning from a past mistake of passing on a successful company due to high valuation could inform future decisions to "lean in" despite price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:55">[04:39:55]</a>.

### Evaluating Talent and Companies with AI

AI could assist in [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | evaluating talent]] within companies, as VCs play a crucial role in helping portfolio companies build strong teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:59">[04:09:59]</a>. Tracking global talent movements and their impact could lead to a "Rotten Tomatoes-like score" for companies, helping to surface opportunities based on the caliber of angel investors and talent involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:07">[04:39:07]</a>.

### Challenges and Nuances in AI-Driven VC

One challenge is that the venture capital landscape changes so frequently that past training data might not always be directly applicable to future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:17">[04:51:17]</a>. The "taste" of investors can become tuned to particular opportunities that may shift over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:23">[04:53:23]</a>. However, fundamental principles, like those discussed by Jim Collins, remain timeless despite changing valuations or exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:06">[04:47:06]</a>. AI would ideally act as a tool to probe thinking rather than provide definitive yes/no answers, leaving the ultimate decision to the human investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:48">[04:04:48]</a>.

## Founder Qualities in the Age of AI

When investing, VCs look for founders who:
*   Think deeply about network effects, strategy, and escaping competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:25">[02:20:25]</a>.
*   Are driven by a "calling" or "affliction" for their work, rather than just seeing it as a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>.
*   Are "learning machines," prioritizing the company's best interest over ego and constantly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>.

A "tell" for an ideal founder is someone who has already deeply considered the challenges and opportunities in their space, often anticipating questions from investors rather than being surprised by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>. The best companies are described as "donut companies," where the board is barely needed because the founders are so effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>.

## Network Effects in AI Investments

Many startup pitches claim to have network effects, but genuine network effects are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>. In early-stage investments, VCs often lean on the theoretical potential of network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14">[02:53:14]</a>. Key signs of a real network effect include a "tipping point" in a small segment of the market, where demand organically pulls more users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.

While much of the recent AI wave has focused on single-player applications or team collaboration, with performance driven by more money, compute, and data, there is an expectation for a new wave of consumer-focused, product-genius-led AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>. These applications would differentiate and grow through network effects and multiplayer experiences, which were not possible in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The challenge for these new products is overcoming the "gravitational pull" of existing platforms like ChatGPT, which users are already habituated to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:06">[03:36:06]</a>.

## Other Areas of Interest

Beyond AI, stablecoins are viewed as a significant area of interest due to their potential to transform global financial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:11">[03:48:11]</a>. They offer a faster, cheaper, 24/7 medium of exchange for international trade, especially in countries with volatile fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>. Stablecoins address the friction in obtaining hard currency (like the US dollar) in certain economies, facilitating global participation and offering significant liquidity through peer-to-peer transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:43">[03:52:43]</a>. Stablecoins like Tether and USDC exhibit network effects, as greater liquidity on exchanges makes them more desirable for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.

Chat PRD is an on-demand Chief Product Officer (CPO) that assists with [[using_ai_for_product_management_and_prd_creation | product work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It was founded by Claire, who is also the Chief Product Officer of LaunchDarkly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. The product started as a side hustle, built using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>.

## The Genesis of Chat PRD
Claire was driven by the desire to automate parts of her work, embracing AI tools like ChatGPT when they first emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. As an executive leader managing product and engineering organizations, she used ChatGPT to [[using_ai_for_product_management_and_prd_creation | write product strategies and product specs]] due to her demanding schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred when Claire used AI to draft a five-page specification for a complex, custom audit data tool in just four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This was possible because she had spent months refining prompts for ChatGPT to achieve high-quality outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The AI even suggested functional requirements, like filters, that she might have otherwise overlooked, highlighting its value as a "little buddy" to round out her thinking and improve efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

### From Prompt to Product
When the GPT store launched, Claire transferred her refined prompt into it, naming it "Chat PRD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. She shared it with her team, who quickly adopted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Recognizing its potential, she purchased the domain chatprd.ai and set up a newsletter signup form and a link to the GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Despite initial traction, the GPT store lacked monetization features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. As a product person focused on profitability, Claire decided to [[building_an_ai_app_from_scratch | build her own app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. She [[building_an_ai_app_from_scratch | built the app]] over Thanksgiving week while her kids were home, leveraging AI to make the development process "really really easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Launched on November 28th, the app initially cost $2 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. As features were added and prices increased, user adoption grew, reaching 10,000 app users and between 50,000 and 100,000 chats on the GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Key Features and Functionality
Chat PRD functions as an on-demand CPO for [[using_ai_for_product_management_and_prd_creation | product work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a specification defining a product's problem space, user needs, features, and capabilities, often outlining tracking plans, security risks, and technical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

Chat PRD offers unique features compared to a standard GPT, including:
*   **Customizable Profile:** Users can provide details about themselves and their company, which the AI remembers, stabilizing information that would otherwise need repeated prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Templates:** Users can upload their company's PRD template for consistency, ensuring the AI adheres to specific formats and requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.
*   **PRD Generation and Improvement:** Claire uses it to:
    *   Write PRDs for new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.
    *   Brainstorm features for roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
    *   Improve existing PRDs, helping coach her team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
    *   The AI can take high-level prompts (e.g., "teams plan features for Chat PRD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>), ask clarifying questions, and then scaffold out detailed sections including problem statements, business goals, user personas, user experience, success metrics, and technical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.
    *   It can refine outputs, such as expanding "lame" high-level user stories into much more specific and actionable details, including outlining features, sub-features, and even specific roles and permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.
*   **Milestones and Sequencing:** The tool can generate detailed milestones and sequencing for projects based on aggressive timelines, helping break down large tasks into actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.
*   **Document Editor:** After generating a PRD in chat mode, users can save it as a document, allowing them to toggle between chat and document modes and directly edit the generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>. The editor includes built-in AI features for instant modifications, like changing tone from "casual" to "business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The chat feature maintains context of any changes made in the document editor, allowing for continuous refinement and addition of sections, such as technical considerations based on specific technologies like Stripe billing and Clerk.dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>.

Chat PRD is used by Claire to manage her own product development, generating project plans and to-do lists for tasks like integrating organizations or building billing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>. It's particularly useful for single founders or small teams who lack a dedicated product person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.

## Solo Development and AI Leverage
Claire notes that building a web app like Chat PRD is "so cheap and easy" now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. She used Next.js and Tailwind CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. The document editor itself, using Tiptap editor, was built in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>. Claire emphasizes that [[building_ai_products_with_lean_teams | building solo]] with AI increases quality and velocity by short-circuiting the traditional product, engineering, and design loop, leading to more focused decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. She extensively used AI to code the app, using Chat PRD itself to scaffold components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.

> "I did this truly on a Sunday... Notion style editing in a day by myself while my kids were watching Aladdin." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>

Claire asserts that while she could build web apps before AI, the difference now is "thousands of times faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>. AI acts as an "on-demand engineering buddy" that provides instant answers and code, enabling rapid learning and implementation without needing to involve another person in the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>. A serviceable first version of a SaaS app that once took 5-9 months could now be built in a weekend with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>. This efficiency creates "multiples of efficiency on engineering output" and "product output" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>.

Claire has committed to releasing new features every weekend since launching Chat PRD, demonstrating high product velocity and proving that significant products can be built with low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>.

## Personal Productivity Hacks Using AI
Claire leverages AI beyond Chat PRD for [[personal_productivity_hacks_using_ai | personal productivity hacks]]:
*   **Automated Email Responses:** She automated email responses for job recruiters and school communications using OpenAI APIs via Zapier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:22:00">[46:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>.
    *   For recruiters, the system identifies recruitment emails, checks them against her job preferences, drafts polite rejection emails, and sends her Slack messages with recommended next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.
    *   For school emails, a Zapier integration reads communications, summarizes them succinctly, filters for information relevant to her children, and highlights necessary actions, sending a daily summary to Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:06:00">[49:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:02:00">[50:02:00]</a>. This tool helps her stay on top of daily school information, often condensing thousands of words into brief summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:36:00">[50:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>.
*   **Voice Chat for Strategic Thinking:** Claire uses voice chat with ChatGPT during her commute to articulate and organize strategic thoughts. This allows her to generate well-articulated strategies for her job while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:53:00">[44:53:00]</a>.
*   **AI for Kids' Activities:** Claire uses AI for educational and creative projects with her children:
    *   **Greek Mythology Pokemon Cards:** She helped her children create Pokemon-style cards, including images generated by AI, based on Greek mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:58:00">[57:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Podcast Hub with Quizzes:** She built a podcast hub that transcribes episodes and creates quizzes at the end, allowing her son to engage with content like Greek mythology podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:52:00">[58:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Runaway Pancakes.com:** A website featuring kid-friendly recipes with step-by-step instructions and Midjourney-generated illustrations. Each step includes exact measurements within the instruction, making it easier for children to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:10:00">[59:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:45:00">[59:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Santa Voicemail:** She trained an 11 Labs voice model on Santa's voice to leave voicemails for her four-year-old as a behavior management tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
    *   **Fact-Checking Kid's Recollections:** Using ChatGPT, she can clarify her children's vague recollections of historical facts, such as the "bucket war" in ancient Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.

## Future of Product Management and AI Businesses
Claire believes that the ratio of Product Managers (PMs) to builder roles will shift dramatically, with PMs potentially managing 20 engineers instead of the typical 7-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:00">[36:34:00]</a>. This efficiency means some companies might hire designers instead of junior PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>. However, AI also enables junior PMs to ramp up faster and have higher impact, acting as an "on-demand coach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:19:00">[37:19:00]</a>.

Claire also suggests that "strategic thinking as a differentiated value for a human" is likely to be disrupted by AI, as LLMs excel at synthesis and applying pre-existing frameworks to business problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:06:00">[38:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>.

What remains for human PMs, according to Claire, includes:
*   **Inspiration, Alignment, and Motivation:** Getting teams excited about a mission and connecting them to the human impact of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>.
*   **Building Capabilities:** The ability to build prototypes will become more critical than just creating documents, leading to the concept of a "prototype manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:42:00">[39:42:00]</a>.
*   **Visionary Leadership:** Product leaders will need to see far into the future and set the ultimate destination, even if AI maps the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>.

Claire is using Chat PRD as an "exercise and an experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:47:00">[54:47:00]</a>, exploring whether the traditional venture funding model is appropriate for this new class of [[ai_product_development | AI businesses]] where development costs are low, and significant revenue can be generated without massive capital infusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:31:00">[53:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>. Chat PRD generated six figures in ARR within six months as a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27:00">[52:27:00]</a>.

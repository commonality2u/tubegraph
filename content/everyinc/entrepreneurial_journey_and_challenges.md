The entrepreneurial paths of Dan Shipper and Brandon discuss the multifaceted nature of building and scaling businesses, highlighting the [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | personal challenges]], strategic shifts, and continuous learning required. Their conversation covers early inspirations, the evolution of business models, and the importance of problem identification and iterative development.

## Early Inspirations and First Ventures

### Dan Shipper's Path
Dan Shipper's [[founding_and_running_a_startup | entrepreneurial journey]] began in middle school after reading a Bill Gates biography, inspiring him to start a Microsoft competitor named "Megasoft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. His initial plan was simply "write soft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This ambition led him to learn coding (Basic), realizing that being technical allowed him to build businesses with only his time as a cost, which was "the coolest thing ever" for a middle schooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

His first product was "Find It," a Blackberry app that made a silent phone ring by sending a specific email, helping him locate his device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This small business helped him pay for gas and food in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. He later sold his college company, Firefly, which developed co-browsing technology for customer service, to a public enterprise software company when he was 23 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, after raising only $20,000 from the Dorm Room Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

### Brandon's Path
Brandon's [[founding_and_running_a_startup | entrepreneurial journey]] started with a love for making things with his hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. A pivotal experience was participating in the Solar Decathlon competition during college, where his team built a solar-powered house designed to be transported by train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. He taught himself AutoCAD to create blueprints, becoming a core team member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

Later, he renovated a school bus into a mobile entrepreneurship school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. His first purely business venture was "Photon," a photo printing app, despite not conducting market research and competing with existing services like Shutterfly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. This experience taught him the importance of simply "shipping" a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.

His next significant venture was founding Clyde, an insurance tech company, inspired by the difficulty his previous employer faced in obtaining simple insurance offerings for their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. Clyde aimed to simplify the launch of extended warranty programs for any business, much like AppleCare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>. He raised $50 million, grew to 100 employees, and sold the company in March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.

## Identifying Problems and Building Businesses

Both Dan and Brandon emphasize the importance of identifying problems as a key [[entrepreneurship_and_authentic_expression_in_startup_culture | entrepreneurial trait]].

Dan views problem identification as a "muscle" that he constantly exercises, often stemming from his "Jewish neuroticism" and tendency to complain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. However, he re-frames problems as opportunities to build and fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

Brandon, coming from an architecture background, highlights the difference between solving problems within a defined "box" and the harder task of defining that box in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. School, he notes, often teaches the former but not the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. He learned to define the box through side projects as a kid because there were no pre-defined paths for computer science or business classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.

Key entrepreneurial traits include:
*   **Iterative Approach**: Learning to iterate and not get stuck on the first solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. Brandon's architecture training taught him that the "first design is going to be the worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.
*   **"I'll figure it out" Confidence**: An essential [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | entrepreneurial trait]] is the confidence to tackle challenges without knowing how, trusting one's ability to learn on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
*   **Curiosity**: A love for problems and an energized response to them, rather than intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>.

## Challenges in [[Founding and running a startup | Startup Growth]]

### Clyde's Journey: A Cautionary Tale
Brandon describes Clyde's growth as a "cautionary tale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.
*   **Premature Product-Market Fit**: Despite early success and funding, they didn't fully understand the business dynamics or the upcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.
*   **Competition**: Competitors emerged soon after they raised their initial seed round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.
*   **Time to Value**: A significant challenge for B2B businesses requiring implementation, where closing a deal doesn't immediately translate into revenue due to internal bureaucracy (business vs. technical teams) and messy retail environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.
*   **Spending Money**: The temptation to spend money because it's available, without fully understanding market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Focus**: Trying to serve every e-commerce platform rather than focusing on a single, well-defined niche like Shopify, which could have led to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   **Saying No**: The importance of maintaining a vision, even if it means turning down early deals with unfavorable exclusive terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

### The Emotional Toll of Exiting
Selling Clyde was a deeply emotional experience for Brandon, leaving him feeling "Shell Shocked" and questioning his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>. He described it as "I can't hear the music anymore," referring to the internal drive that fueled his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. He experienced panic attacks and illness, highlighting the intense stress founders endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. This aligns with the broader [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | personal challenges and learning in startup growth]] often discussed by entrepreneurs.

## Every's Evolution and New Model

### From Collective to Pyramid
Dan Shipper's journey to Every (originally "Superorganizers") began with a desire to build a "Tools For Thought" business, leading him to start a newsletter for customer interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>. He found he loved writing and built a media company (Every) with Nathan Baschez, aiming to bundle business newsletters and create a "writer collective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>.

However, the collective model faced [[challenges_and_strategies_in_marketing_and_storytelling | challenges]]:
*   **Scarcity of Writers**: Very few writers possess the necessary combination of business knowledge, writing skill, consistency, and desire to write weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:24">[01:40:24]</a>. High earning potential in business roles also deters potential writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit Shift**: Changing writers meant losing product-market fit, unlike software where founders can hire engineers after building the initial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>.
*   **Bundle Economics**: Complex and often unsatisfactory for all parties involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:56">[01:42:56]</a>.

This led Every to pivot towards a single, core newsletter, with Dan himself writing more, recognizing his strength and enjoyment in that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:50">[01:43:50]</a>. This reflects a shift towards [[entrepreneurship_and_authentic_expression_in_startup_culture | authentic expression in startup culture]] and focusing on what founders are truly good at.

### The New Every Model: A Pyramid Approach
Every now operates on a "pyramid" model designed for sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>:
1.  **Bottom Layer (Free Content)**: High-quality writing and podcasts attract a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>.
2.  **Second Layer (Every Paid Subscription)**: A $20/month subscription bundles all writing, behind-the-scenes content, course discounts, and access to software like Spiral, Sparkle, and Lex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.
3.  **Third Layer (Training, Consulting, Courses)**: Fewer people, but higher revenue per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>.
4.  **Top Layer (Speaking, Advising)**: Even fewer, but most expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>.

Cash flows from the top down to fund more writing and product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>. This model prioritizes quality and audience relationship over single business models, allowing for diverse products tailored to different audience segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>. It's a contrast to the typical Silicon Valley tech business model, which often emphasizes focusing on one business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>.

## AI Product Development at Every

Inspired by an article about the "billion-dollar solopreneur," Brandon realized that Every's existing distribution could solve his challenge of getting products into users' hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. He proposed a product studio within Every to build tools for solo entrepreneurs, leading to his role as the first entrepreneur-in-residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:28">[02:12:28]</a>.

Every's approach to [[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | AI product development]] focuses on "AI wrappers"—building specific functionalities on top of general-purpose AI models like Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>.
*   **Spiral**: An AI-powered prompt builder that converts podcast transcripts into tweets and LinkedIn posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>. It significantly reduces the time and effort required for repetitive but skilled tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>.
*   **Sparkle**: An AI file cleaner that organizes desktop, downloads, and documents folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a>. This product highlights the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_startups | challenges and opportunities in AI startups]] as it requires users to trust AI with their files, which can be perceived as "scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:24">[02:50:24]</a>.

This strategy mirrors the evolution of Excel, a general-purpose tool that eventually led to the "unbundling" into specialized B2B SaaS products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>. Similarly, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude are training users on AI's capabilities, leading to demand for more specific, easier-to-use AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:09">[01:46:09]</a>. These purpose-driven AI tools can also make AI more accessible to people who wouldn't directly interact with general-purpose chat interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:28">[01:47:28]</a>.

## Building Calm Businesses

Every's core philosophy is to "build calm businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:35">[02:28:35]</a>. This involves:
*   **Authenticity**: Focusing on what founders are good at and enjoy, rather than adhering to external expectations or traditional scaling playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Growth**: Not chasing excessive venture capital funding to avoid external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.
*   **Team Quality**: Prioritizing a high-quality team and fostering a "creative playground" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:15">[01:28:15]</a>.
*   **Intentional Pace**: Moving fast but deliberately, avoiding rapid, unsustainable hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>.

This approach ensures that the work remains fun and focused on producing high-quality content and products that truly deliver value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The continuous discussion and refinement of their model aim to establish a unique and successful media company that leverages [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_technology_innovation | technology innovation]] effectively.

## Key Enhancements in Spiral V2

### [[spiral_v2_interface_redesign | Interface Redesign]]
Spiral V2 introduces a complete [[spiral_v2_interface_redesign | interface redesign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This new design makes it significantly easier to filter and sort content by inputs, outputs, tone, or voice, helping users quickly find the specific "spiral" they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Enhanced Sharing for Teams
The sharing features for teams have been improved, enabling users to more easily organize "spirals" and collaborate effectively with team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Expanded Public Library
Spiral V2 includes a Public Library featuring over 200 handcrafted "spirals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These pre-made spirals are designed to assist with various content creation tasks, including X posts, LinkedIn posts, and YouTube descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### AI Writing Engine Upgrades
Significant time has been invested in enhancing the underlying AI writing engine behind Spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This includes the [[integration_with_claude_35_sonic_model | integration of the new Claude 3.5 Sonic model]], leading to even better outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Benefits
Spiral was created based on the insight that creative work often involves a great deal of repetitive drudgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The goal of Spiral is to make this repetitive work faster, easier, and of higher quality, allowing creators to spend more time on the core creative tasks they care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Unlike other AI tools that may produce sloppy or generic content, Spiral is designed to help repurpose existing material into outputs that are more confident, catchier, or more authentic, reflecting the best version of the user in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Pricing and Availability
Spiral can be purchased standalone for $15 a month per seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Alternatively, it is available as part of the "Every bundle," which grants access to Spiral, all of the company's writing, and all other products built and launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The new Spiral V2 is available for trial at spiral.computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

[[the_process_and_benefits_of_using_ai_in_programming | AI in programming assistance]] is transforming how software is built, lowering the barrier to entry, and enabling new use cases. The advancements in large language models (LLMs) and tools like code interpreters have created new layers of abstraction in programming [00:36:37].

## Grimoire: A Wizard-Based Coding Assistant
Grimoire, created by Nick Aobos, is described as the number one programming GPT [00:00:00]. It functions as a wizard-based coding assistant and has facilitated over a million chats [00:00:07]. Aobos is considered an expert in building custom GPTs and using ChatGPT for programming [00:01:46].

### Origins and Capabilities
Aobos, a programmer with over a decade of professional experience, initially experimented with GitHub Copilot, noting its ability to auto-complete and generate large code sections from comments [00:02:09]. With the release of GPT-4, he realized its potential for programming assistance, observing that its output was comparable to, or even exceeded, college-level computer science students [00:03:31].

Grimoire was developed to address the "blank canvas problem" for new programmers and provide a structured learning path [00:14:57]. It combines predefined project templates with a curriculum, serving as both an assistant and a tutorial [00:06:06]. The platform incorporates numerous "hotkeys" to quickly perform tasks, such as instantly deploying websites via Netlify [00:11:07].

### Examples of Assistance
*   **Website Generation:** Grimoire can create simple websites, like a "Link in Bio" or a "coffee website," from just a few words, demonstrating how sites can be created "in seconds" [00:07:34].
*   **Code Interpretation and File Management:** The tool can generate and provide files, such as Python scripts to create a QR code for a newly generated website, and can automatically zip and download these files [00:13:17], [00:25:10].
*   **Curriculum and Learning:** Grimoire offers a comprehensive curriculum, structured into "chapters and parts," covering topics from basic "Hello World" exercises and GitHub workflows to more advanced concepts like backend development and databases [00:17:07], [00:20:50]. This curriculum leverages the LLM's ability to expand on "a seed of an idea" to summarize complex topics, potentially replacing traditional college curricula [00:21:59].

## Prompt Programming as a New Abstraction Layer
Aobos views the interaction with LLMs for generating code as a new branch of programming, which he calls "prompt programming" [00:06:44]. This is seen as a new layer of abstraction, sitting atop existing programming language hierarchies (e.g., binary, assembly, high-level languages, scripting languages) [00:06:49], [00:42:06].

Instead of writing explicit code, users give prompts in natural language (e.g., English), and the AI generates the code [00:08:53]. This "fuzzy and unstructured" communication with a computer represents a novel interface for programming [00:42:47].

## Tools and Workflow in AI-Assisted Programming
AI tools like Grimoire are designed to be general programming assistants, capable of answering quick questions or helping to break down complex problems into smaller steps [00:22:32].

One significant advantage of custom GPTs over vanilla ChatGPT for programming tasks lies in their ability to be "nudged" towards more truthful, helpful, and thoughtful responses through system prompts and predefined planning steps [00:24:06]. The use of hotkeys also significantly speeds up the workflow by automating repetitive actions [00:24:50].

Other tools and concepts that enhance the [[generative_ai_in_programming | AI programming]] workflow include:
*   **GitHub Copilot:** Provides auto-completion and code generation [00:02:40].
*   **Cursor:** A VS Code branch built with [[generative_ai_in_programming | AI-first]] principles, designed to integrate ChatGPT into a programmer's flow [00:18:33]. Aobos recommends it for professional developers learning to use AI [00:19:14].
*   **Code Interpreter:** This feature "unlocks so much crazy stuff," enabling the AI to spin out scripts and perform bizarre tasks [00:29:06].

## Benefits and Future Outlook
The ability of AI to quickly generate code and automate tasks significantly lowers the barrier for entry into programming [00:36:30]. This not only makes things faster and easier but also unlocks entirely new use cases and fundamentally transforms how software is built, especially for large teams [00:37:02]. For instance, Facebook uses AI to generate test cases for massive codebases, with 70% of them going into production [00:37:12].

Aobos believes we are only beginning to understand the full potential of "prompting" and that it will take 20 years to truly hit its limits [00:37:34]. He is particularly fascinated by the concept of "large action models" (LAMs) as opposed to large language models (LLMs) [00:38:37].

This implies a future where AI can control various applications and systems, from ordering a pizza to booking an Uber or filling out spreadsheets [00:38:47]. This capability would allow text-based commands to be transformed into structured actions, leading to new ways of building "fuzzy and unstructured" applications [00:39:02].

The potential extends beyond programming to [[applications_of_ai_in_automating_tasks | general computer interaction]]:
*   **App Guidance:** AI can provide step-by-step tutorials for complex applications, as demonstrated by ChatGPT providing a perfect tutorial for using Adobe After Effects [00:40:30].
*   **Proactive Assistance:** The future may see AI becoming more proactive, initiating conversations and offering personalized plans, similar to a high-level CEO receiving a daily brief from their assistants [00:53:12], [00:54:03]. This suggests a shift from reactive to proactive [[the_role_and_capabilities_of_ai_agents | AI agents]].

Aobos also explores using AI for personal [[improving_personal_practices_with_guided_ai_assistance | practices]], such as an "emotion shaman" GPT that helps interpret and reframe emotions by reflecting journal entries back to the user [00:44:01], [00:45:51]. This aligns with research on emotional granularity, where precise emotional vocabulary aids in coping [00:47:00]. This showcases AI's potential as a "mirror and a mentor" [00:46:19].

Overall, AI in programming assistance represents a significant leap in how humans interact with computers, offering new interfaces and vastly expanding the capabilities of both novice and expert users [00:42:45].

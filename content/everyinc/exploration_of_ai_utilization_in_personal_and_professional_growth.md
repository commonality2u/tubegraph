Nick, a prominent programmer, has made significant strides in [[AI in personal and professional settings | AI utilization]] for both professional development and personal growth. His notable creation, Grimoire, is the number one programming GPT, a wizard-based coding assistant that has facilitated over a million chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Grimoire: AI for Programming

Nick's journey into [[AI in personal and professional settings | AI for programming]] began with his long-standing professional programming career, spanning over 11 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. He initially explored small AI projects, mainly for games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. A pivotal moment was discovering GitHub Copilot, which impressed him with its ability to complete large sections of code from simple comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The release of ChatGPT and especially GPT-4 further "blown away" him by its capabilities for programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Prompt Programming: A New Abstraction Layer
Nick conceptualizes "prompt programming" or "abstract programming" as a new branch or layer in programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This idea positions natural language prompts as the next abstraction on top of traditional programming languages, assembly, and binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. It allows users to give commands in English and receive functional code, enabling rapid creation and modification of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Grimoire in Action
Grimoire aims to solve the "blank canvas problem" for new programmers by providing pre-built projects and a structured learning path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Key features and demonstrations include:
*   **Instant Website Creation** Grimoire can create simple websites, like a "Link in Bio" site or a "coffee website," in seconds with minimal input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. It leverages "conversation starter" buttons and pre-defined project templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Netlify Integration** Using the "N" hotkey, Grimoire instantly deploys generated code online via Netlify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. These sites are ephemeral, deleting after one hour unless claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

*   **Curriculum-based Learning** Grimoire offers a comprehensive "curriculum" for learning programming, structured into chapters like a "Hogwarts-type way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. This includes beginner topics (Hello World, GitHub basics) and advanced concepts like backend development, databases, and creative tools (Midjourney, Runway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. It even summarizes college computer science curricula into a few chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Integration with Developer Tools** Grimoire teaches users about advanced tools like Cursor, an [[Exploring human and AI collaboration | AI-first]] code editor based on VS Code, which seamlessly integrates ChatGPT into the programming workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Hotkeys for Efficiency** Nick developed numerous hotkeys (e.g., "Z" to zip and download files) to streamline programming tasks and reduce typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. These hotkeys anticipate user needs, guiding the conversation back to productive programming paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Planning Partner** Grimoire excels as a planning partner, breaking down complex programming problems into smaller, actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. This feature helps users visualize and modify plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.

## Building Successful GPTs

Nick believes that GPTs, especially with code interpreters, are vastly underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. He notes that code interpreters unlock significant capabilities, enabling the spinning out of scripts and "bizarre things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

Key insights for building effective GPTs include:
*   **Solving the Blank Canvas Problem** Provide pre-built projects or clear starting points to guide users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Defining Purpose** Consider whether the GPT is for personal use or intended for a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Experimentation** The process involves extensive experimentation, fiddling with prompts, and observing responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. Nick himself hit GPT-4's usage cap multiple times daily while testing Grimoire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
*   **Nudging and Steering** Users need to "nudge" and "aim" LLMs to get the best results, often by explicitly defining their role or style (e.g., "you are an expert writer") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

## [[The role of AI in personal growth and integration | AI for Personal Growth]]

Beyond programming, Nick explores [[the_role_of_ai_in_personal_growth_and_integration | AI]] for personal development, exemplified by his "Emotion Shaman" GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

### The Emotion Shaman: AI as a Mirror
The Emotion Shaman is designed to help users, like Nick who tends to suppress emotions, identify and interpret their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. By journaling to the GPT, it reflects thoughts and emotions back, offering a new perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. The GPT is instructed with therapy-related concepts and extensive lists of emotions, drawing from "emotion wheels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

This application aligns with the concept of "emotional granularity" by neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, where using precise words for emotions leads to better coping mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

### AI for Life Planning and Decision Making
[[Using AI for Personal Coaching | AI can also serve as a personal planning partner]]:
*   **Daily Planning** Users can input their daily to-do lists, and the AI will generate a plan, including "obvious" but often overlooked steps (e.g., "have a healthy breakfast") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. This "pre-injection" of a plan into one's mind removes friction and facilitates action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
*   **Simulating One-Way Door Decisions** [[Exploring Quantified Self and AI for SelfImprovement | AI can simulate]] the outcomes of "one-way door decisions" (major life choices like career changes or relationships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. By providing journal entries, the AI can project future journal entries as if a particular decision were made, helping users recognize themselves in potential future states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.

## The Future of AI Interaction

Nick foresees a future where [[how_ai_is_transforming_work_and_personal_life | AI becomes]] more proactive, anticipating user needs rather than solely responding to explicit prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. This includes features like an app greeting you in the morning with a curated to-do list based on your priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. This shift moves towards [[adaptive_use_of_ai_for_personal_and_creative_tasks | AI acting]] as a "parenting" or "nudging" influence, intercepting unproductive thought patterns or moods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

The development of "Large Action Models" (LAMs), as exemplified by Rabbit's approach, suggests a future where natural language commands directly trigger actions across different systems and applications, such as ordering a pizza or booking an Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. This ability to transform text into structured and sensible commands opens up new possibilities for building fuzzy, unstructured, and abstract applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

Ultimately, [[ai_as_a_tool_for_personalized_learning_and_development | AI is transforming]] how humans communicate with computers, turning vague ideas into concrete forms through natural language interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. This lowers the barrier to programming and makes complex tasks, like video editing or using intricate software, much easier by providing instant, step-by-step tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This will lead to a new layer of AI operating on top of existing apps and the internet, controlling computer functions in novel ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

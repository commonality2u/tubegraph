Seth, an American data scientist, economist, and author, recently captured attention by writing his book, *Who Makes the NBA*, in just 30 days using [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rapid [[writing_and_content_creation_strategies | creative process]] has led him to believe that [[the_role_of_ai_in_publishing_and_storytelling | AI]] will "transform everything" in the publishing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## The Accelerated Creative Process

For Seth, [[the_role_of_ai_in_publishing_and_storytelling | AI]], particularly the "Data Analysis" tool (formerly Code Interpreter) in [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | ChatGPT]], has dramatically sped up his [[writing_and_content_creation_strategies | writing]] and data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Tasks that once took months now take days or hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, allowing him to complete a book he considers his "proudest" in a "shockingly little period of time" of "30 days of full-time work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The enjoyment derived from this new process is a significant factor. Seth found it "wildly fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> because [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | ChatGPT]] handled the "annoying" parts of data analysis and chart creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This includes tasks like:
*   Generating charts (e.g., NBA players' college affiliations with institution-specific colors instantaneously) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Creating acronyms (like "MUGSIs" for "metric for understanding game given sporting individuals Effectiveness and size") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, a skill Seth admits he doesn't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   Performing complex data analysis and regressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   Generating [[books_dreams_and_creative_process | art]] (e.g., "a piece of DNA dribbling a basketball") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, enabling him to express visual [[books_dreams_and_creative_process | creativity]] he otherwise couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

The process often involves a "long back and forth" with [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | ChatGPT]], guiding it through iterations to get the desired output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This iterative dialogue is enjoyable, unlike the "laborious coding" that previously led to procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | ChatGPT]] also helps authors understand their own evolving needs as they see initial results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

## Financial Considerations and Market Impact

Seth notes a stark contrast in financial models between self-publishing and traditional publishing:
*   **Traditional Publishing:** Authors typically receive an advance and then about "a dollar for every book" sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. His first book, *Everybody Lies*, was a bestseller and "exploded," leading to a "big advance" and even "bigger advance" for his second book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.
*   **Self-Publishing:** Authors might earn about "$6 for every book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. This higher per-book earning makes direct advertising a more viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>.

Despite the joy of the [[books_dreams_and_creative_process | creative process]] and the rapid turnaround, *Who Makes the NBA* hasn't yet generated enough financial return to be a "worthwhile Financial Pursuit" given the effort involved in writing and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. However, Seth is exploring advertising to make it more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>.

## Critiques of the Traditional Book Industry

Seth believes the traditional book industry has a "wrong" perception of what readers want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. He argues that many books, including his own previous traditionally published works, contain "so much like fluff, you know a long story a buildup big words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. In contrast, his self-published, [[the_role_of_ai_in_publishing_and_storytelling | AI]]-assisted book prioritizes "facts a couple dad jokes and some graphs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, a style he believes "people actually prefer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

> [!quote] "The whole book industry seems wrong to me in thinking that people want these long wind up in this story and you know descriptions of all the people and you know these big words kind of just you know tell me the the point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

## The [[the_future_of_books_in_the_digital_age | Future of Books]] and Authorship

The ability to write a "good book in 30 days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a> fundamentally "changes all the rules of how publishing Works should work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a>. Seth is passionate about exploring his [[books_dreams_and_creative_process | creativity]] through rapid book production, even if the financial model isn't yet fully optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. He envisions a future where he could write many more books in similar series, such as *Who Makes the NFL* or *Who Becomes President* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.

This [[entrepreneurial_journey_without_traditional_venture_capital | entrepreneurial journey]] in publishing allows authors to engage directly with their curiosity and [[finding_personal_truth_and_integrity_in_writing | personal truth]], transforming the "energy sucking" tasks of traditional data analysis and [[writing_and_content_creation_strategies | writing]] into an "energizing" conversation with [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aiassisted_writing | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. The shift means that "any question that humans know the answer to is answerable pretty quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, making the skill of "knowing which questions to ask" the most valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Seth feels this aligns with his passion and provides a sense of doing "more good in the world entertaining people with sports books than I would just another line coder at a company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>, hinting at a new [[the_relationship_between_authorship_and_world_impact | relationship between authorship and world impact]].

Nicholas, a general partner at the incubator Prehype, has been an early adopter of significant technology trends over the past decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. His first company, Basno, was an electronic badge company that predated NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. He also started using GPT-3 as early as 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This early engagement has allowed him to understand and apply these tools effectively in his business, particularly in [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | developing AI tools for entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Autos: An AI-Native Incubation Platform

Prehype has incubated over 50 startups, including BarkBox, Row, and Headway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Recognizing the potential of AI, Nicholas founded a new company, Autos, specifically to facilitate more and better business incubations using GPT-3 and GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This creates a "GPT all the way down" scenario where AI is used to build the business, the product itself uses AI to serve customers, and customers then use AI to build their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The core goal of Autos is to help customers transition from having zero business to a fully functioning one as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. With AI, this process now takes an average of three days, a stark contrast to the months it used to take or cases where businesses wouldn't launch at all due to lack of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Autos is currently experiencing high demand, with thousands of people seeking its services and a rapid 48-hour payback period for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Why AI?
Nicholas emphasizes that AI is "everywhere" in their work not as a buzzword, but because it helps them stay close to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. AI enables conversational interaction with customers, allowing for better understanding of their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Furthermore, by [[applications_of_ai_in_automating_tasks | automating repetitive tasks]] and capabilities, AI reduces the need for hiring and managing staff, which allows founders to remain closer to their customers and avoid getting "sucked back into the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### The Problem AI Solves
Historically, helping entrepreneurs launch a company was a slow process, often limited to a few times a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This was due to the extensive work involved in:
*   Developing strong relationships with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   Framing diverse business ideas consistently for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   Finding and synthesizing customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   Conducting lead acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Nicholas highlights that humans are not "great pickers of ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, and it's always better to "go out and try things" to learn and gain first-party insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Autos aims to make these processes available to a much wider audience by encoding them in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

There's a significant gap: 60-65% of people have a business idea and believe they have the resources and knowledge to start a business, yet only about 8% actually do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This "lossy" process is often due to not knowing where to start or being overwhelmed by too many potential tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. AI helps by putting people into "edit mode" rather than "creation mode," allowing early momentum to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## The End-to-End AI-Powered Entrepreneurial Journey

Autos streamlines the entrepreneurial journey with an AI-driven, end-to-end process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This journey starts with an ad and unfolds primarily within an Instagram DM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

The process includes:
1.  **Customer Acquisition via Ads:** Autos runs ads like "that little business idea you have, it'll still be an idea next week or you can let our AI make you an AI and go from zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Facebook's product for acquiring people straight into a conversation is key for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
2.  **Initial AI Conversation:** The AI, trained to request a name from the entrepreneur, steers the conversation towards fixed outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. It asks about the target customer and their unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This helps founders deeply imagine the person they will serve, fostering "founder-customer fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
3.  **Problem Refinement and Solution Pitching:** The AI helps precisely define the problem, which in turn helps generate interesting solution alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. It pitches potential solutions across various business models (software, platform, physical product, financial product, content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
4.  **Automated Pitch Deck Generation:** Based on a few questions, a series of GPTs run in the background to create a presentation in about five to six minutes (if GPT-4 isn't backed up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This deck includes:
    *   Contextual slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
    *   A restated problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
    *   Iconography and branding elements (color palette, icon generated from defined descriptions using models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   Business naming suggestions based on "heroes of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
    *   A user journey framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
    *   Key benefits and pricing suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
    *   Market size estimation (using Google searches for data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
    *   A to-do list for the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

    Users can edit the deck, including icons and elevator pitches, and regenerate it automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

5.  **Payment and Further Automation:** After a small payment ($30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, customers unlock tools for gathering customer feedback:
    *   **Landing Page Generation:** A website is automatically created using assets and concepts from the pitch deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. A domain is also registered for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>.
    *   **Custom AI Co-pilot:** Each entrepreneur receives their own hosted GPT that can acquire leads, qualify them, and sell different parts of their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
    *   **Ad Campaign Assets:** Autos creates assets to help the entrepreneur run their own ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
    *   **Automated Customer Interview Tool:** A voice-oriented chat tool is provided for conducting need-finding interviews with known contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
    *   **Automated Product Roadmap:** All collected interview conversations are synthesized into a product roadmap, identifying key features and organizing them in a dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

This [[leveraging_ai_for_rapid_business_prototyping | rapid business prototyping]] is validating for entrepreneurs, allowing them to see their ideas come to life and build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

## Building AI Tools: Nicholas's Approach

Nicholas admits he has never taken a computer science class or programmed prior to ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. ChatGPT has been "completely revolutionizing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, allowing him to [[automating_repetitive_writing_with_ai | write code]] that functions and delivers results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. He has generated many more lines of code in the last year and a half than in his entire life combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

His process for prototyping and building these AI tools involves:
1.  **Describing the Desired Output:** Nicholas starts by clearly defining what he wants ChatGPT to create, whether it's code, a color palette, or an API call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
2.  **Iterative Scripting with ChatGPT:** He pastes existing scripts or API documentation into ChatGPT, explaining what needs to be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. When errors occur, he pastes the error message back into ChatGPT, and through a few back-and-forths, usually gets a correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
3.  **Leveraging Airtable and Cloud Functions:** Nicholas uses Airtable as a core database for prototyping due to its intuitive interface and script-running capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. For longer-running tasks (over 30 seconds, Airtable's script timeout limit), he uses Google Cloud functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. ChatGPT writes the scripts to automate actions based on Airtable changes and to connect to third-party services like DNS providers or APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
4.  **Productionization:** Once a prototype functions well, it's moved to a more robust system like Superbase, which offers similar database and edge function features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

This approach means Nicholas can be the "first draft maker" for longer within his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, staying closer to the customer's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## The Philosophy of AI-Driven Prototyping

Nicholas's philosophy is that "the prototype is worth a thousand decks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. AI enables anyone to create a small working prototype to show their work and gather feedback in a couple of hours, a process that previously took significant time, skills, or external investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Key aspects of this philosophy include:
*   **Rapid Iteration:** AI helps in quickly generating different versions or ideas, like exploring various business models or comparing seemingly disparate concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Reduced UI/UX Overhead:** By focusing on functionality over elaborate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in the early stages, AI-driven development avoids time wasted on minor design decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. If a service can run in the background or deliver information via simple text, it's prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.
*   **Empowering Non-Technical Founders:** The combination of a flexible database like Airtable and ChatGPT's scripting capabilities empowers individuals without traditional programming knowledge to [[using_ai_for_business_idea_generation | generate business ideas]], build prototypes, and connect various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. This acts as a "force multiplier" for entrepreneurial expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.

## Future Implications

Nicholas believes that AI can push entrepreneurship to new heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>, defining entrepreneurship as "making something in service of someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>. He is interested in a future where founders can remain the "first draft makers" for longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, staying closer to their customers and driving innovation more directly.

Autos is a testament to this vision, showcasing how AI can be used for end-to-end automation in business incubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. The company provides a model for how non-technical individuals can [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startups | evaluate AI technology for startups]] and use it to build and scale products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. Nicholas is also documenting this thought process in an upcoming book titled *Me, My Customer, and AI* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>.

Alex, creator of Alex and Books, a platform with over a million followers for book recommendations, reviews, and reading tips, discusses how [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI tools]] can be leveraged to enhance the reading process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## The Future of Books

While books have existed for thousands of years and are likely to persist, the rapid advancement of technology, such as Neuralink, raises questions about the future of traditional reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Alex believes books will remain useful until a point where direct brain downloads become possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Why Books Matter

Alex's passion for books began in college upon discovering self-improvement literature, starting with *How to Win Friends and Influence People* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. He realized books could teach social and communication skills, opening his eyes to a vast genre beyond textbooks and fiction that could aid in personal improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

While he uses all formats, Alex prefers physical books for their ability to facilitate disconnection from technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Studies suggest that reading physical books can lead to better retention, as readers associate information with its physical location in the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:43">[02:23:43]</a>.

## AI for Book Discovery and Summarization

[[using_ai_for_book_recommendations_and_summaries | AI tools]] like ChatGPT and Claude AI can significantly enhance book discovery and comprehension:

*   **Quick Summaries**: If someone mentions a book you're unfamiliar with, you can use [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]] to quickly summarize it, allowing for informed conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:999">[05:21:999]</a>. ChatGPT's browse feature is particularly useful for less popular titles not deeply ingrained in its training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Summaries can be tailored to desired lengths, from two sentences to two pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Recommendations**: [[Using AI for book recommendations and summaries | AI acts as the "ultimate librarian"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, capable of suggesting books similar to those you've enjoyed, drawing from millions of titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Reading Taste**: By asking [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]] about the "vibes" or themes of books you enjoy, it can articulate why you like certain content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, helping you identify specific preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. For example, when asked about the "vibes" of *Children of Memory* and *100 Million Dollar Offers*, ChatGPT identified preferences for "complex and thought-provoking content" and "practical and actionable" insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. [[Using AI to improve writing taste and style | This function can be life-changing for understanding your literary tastes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## AI for Problem-Solving and Application

[[ai_as_a_tool_for_personalized_learning_and_development | AI]] can also serve as a powerful tool for practical application and deeper understanding of texts:

*   **Book Recommendations for Problems**: You can prompt [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]] with a specific problem or area for improvement in your life or business, and it will recommend relevant books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. For example, when asked for books on aligning a diverse media company, ChatGPT suggested *Start With Why* and *Leaders Eat Last* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.
*   **Applying Frameworks**: [[Enhancing productivity with AI tools | AI]] can help apply frameworks from non-fiction books to personal situations. For instance, Alex used ChatGPT to apply Alex Hormozi's "Grand Slam Offer" framework to his reading course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>. By providing the framework and then inputting specific details about his course, ChatGPT helped construct a compelling offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Study Buddy**: For complex or older texts, [[ai_as_a_tool_for_personalized_learning_and_development | AI acts as a personal tutor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:19:00">[38:19:00]</a>. If a philosophical book like *Siddhartha* uses "Old English" or has deeper meanings, you can ask [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]] to explain symbols (e.g., "what does the river in Siddhartha symbolize?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:00">[33:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. If the explanation is too complex, you can ask it to use simpler words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>. This highlights how [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]] can translate between "different Englishes" (e.g., philosophical English, tech English), making dense content accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>.
*   **Remembering Key Lessons**: By integrating important lessons or questions into ChatGPT's memory, it can serve as a personalized reminder system for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:54:00">[56:54:00]</a>, similar to a therapist's guiding question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33:00">[56:33:00]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for applying non-fiction insights when they are most relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:00">[57:15:00]</a>.

## AI for Content Creation and Market Research

[[enhancing_the_writing_process_with_ai_tools | AI]] can also support content creators by analyzing audience feedback:

*   **Summarizing Survey Responses**: If you have collected survey data, [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]] can summarize responses and identify common pain points. For example, Alex used ChatGPT to analyze over 500 responses about reading obstacles to identify the top 10 most common problems, such as time management, retention, and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## General Reading Tips

Alex emphasizes a few key reading strategies:

*   **Read When You Need It**: Prioritize reading books that are relevant to your current life priorities or projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.
*   **Balance Serious and Fun Books**: Just as one watches movies in addition to documentaries, it's important to include "fun" reads alongside educational ones to maintain engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Buying vs. Reading**: Buying books and reading them are "two different hobbies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. It's crucial to remember that purchasing a book implies an investment of 5-10 hours of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
*   **Start Short**: Short books are easier to finish, which helps build momentum and reduces intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **Find the Right Book**: Many people believe they aren't readers because they were forced to read "boring books" in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. The "unlock" comes from realizing you are free to read anything you desire, often through stumbling upon engaging self-improvement or other genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>.

By leveraging [[ai_tools_for_reading_and_learning | AI]], individuals can enhance their reading skills, discover new content, deepen comprehension, and apply knowledge more effectively, fostering a more personalized and productive learning journey.

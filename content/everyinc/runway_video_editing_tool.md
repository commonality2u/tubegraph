Runway is an [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI tool]] designed for [[ai_tools_for_design_and_creation | creative projects]], specifically focused on video generation and animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It offers the capability to go from text to image to video all within a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This makes it a valuable asset for creators working under tight deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Runway is particularly useful for [[creating_cinematic_images_with_ai | animating cinematic images]] due to the high level of control it provides over movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image-to-Video**: Enables a complete workflow from a text prompt to a finished video clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **[[using_runway_and_motion_brush_for_animation | Motion Brush]]**: A powerful tool for precisely controlling movement within an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Users can select specific parts of an image and dictate how much and in what direction they should move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Using the [[using_runway_and_motion_brush_for_animation | Motion Brush]]

The [[using_runway_and_motion_brush_for_animation | Motion Brush]] allows for detailed animation of still images, turning them into dynamic video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Workflow Steps

1.  **Select the Image**: Choose an image, such as a Midjourney-generated image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. An example used is an image of Nicholas Cage surrounded by spirits and a Book of the Dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
2.  **Activate Motion Brush**: Click to enter the [[using_runway_and_motion_brush_for_animation | Motion Brush]] tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
3.  **Brush Over Areas**: Use different "brushes" to color over specific areas of the image that you want to animate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   **Nicholas Cage**: Apply a brush for subtle "ambient movement" (e.g., 0.5) to suggest slight hair or clothing movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   **Spirits/Smoke**: Use a vertical brush to make smoke or mist rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   **Light Rays**: Apply "proximity" settings to make light rays appear to come towards the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   **Candles**: Use a small amount of "ambient noise" for a flickering effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Parameters**: After painting, go back and fine-tune the parameters for each brush (e.g., intensity, direction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This often involves trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
5.  **Add Camera Movement (Optional)**: Introduce camera movements like zoom out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
6.  **Generate**: Generate multiple versions (e.g., five at a time) to explore different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Generation typically takes about a minute per image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Post-Generation [[editing_techniques_in_ai_films | Editing Techniques]]

After generating multiple animated clips, users can import them into video editing software like Premiere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. It's possible to layer these generations, taking desired parts from each clip (e.g., smoke from one, Nicholas Cage's movement from another) and masking them together to achieve the best result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This flexibility allows for highly customized and refined [[creating_cinematic_experiences_with_ai_tools | cinematic experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

From: [[everyinc]] <br/> 

The team at Every is pioneering a unique business model that integrates a core media business with software product development. This approach allows for a symbiotic relationship where each aspect supports the other's growth and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:01">[05:35:01]</a>.

## Core Business Model

At its foundation, Every operates a robust media business, including a newsletter, a YouTube channel, and podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:04">[01:46:04]</a>. The core strategy involves building software products directly from the experiences and ideas generated by running this media operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>. This model intentionally deviates from the traditional venture-backed startup path by avoiding large funding rounds and extensive hiring, instead encouraging self-reliance supported by shared ideas and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:09">[12:17:09]</a>.

### Advantages of the Model

*   **Flexibility and Control**: This approach offers the freedom to choose when to experience stress, differentiating it from the external pressures of investor expectations in highly funded startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:03">[25:29:03]</a>.
*   **Fostering Creativity**: The absence of endless funding necessitates a more creative approach to problem-solving and resource management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:09">[26:36:09]</a>.
*   **Time for Development**: The model has provided ample time for the business and its products to "bake" and mature, leading to strong foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:06">[14:12:06]</a>.
*   **"Creative Playground"**: Internally, the team aspires to build a "creative playground" where ideas can be experimented with freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:02">[06:32:02]</a>.

## Integrated Software Products

Every has developed several software products that stem from its media operations, with a focus on [[Impact of AI on media and product development|AI]]-powered tools.

### Spiral

Spiral is a key software product designed to automate 80% of repetitive writing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It learns a user's tone, voice, and structure from their existing content, then generates new content (e.g., turning a podcast into a tweet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. The recently launched new version features a redesigned interface and over 250 "public spirals" â€“ pre-crafted templates that convert one form of content into another, which users can clone and customize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:08">[02:46:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:04">[02:51:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Its success is attributed to its simplicity and direct utility, as it evolved from an internal process of prompting AI for tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:02">[19:54:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:02">[19:56:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>.

### Sparkle

Sparkle is an [[Impact of AI on media and product development|AI]] file organizer that helps users organize their computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:09">[08:17:09]</a>. It's described as a basic yet effective product that gains approximately 50 new customers daily, demonstrating a "wait and see" approach to investment and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### Kora

Kora is a product that has yet to be publicly announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:45:00">[55:45:00]</a>.

## Impact of AI

[[Impact of AI on media and product development|AI]] plays a significant role in the viability and efficiency of this business model. It has dramatically reduced the cost and time required to develop products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>, making it possible for a small team to build and manage multiple offerings. AI tools also streamline mundane tasks and enable the creation of internal tools quickly, which historically would have required significant engineering resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:02">[16:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:07">[16:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:02">[16:16:02]</a>. For example, AI helps generate images for content and even parts of podcast scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:03">[15:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:04">[15:51:04]</a>.

## Vision for the Future

The long-term goal is to deepen the synergy between the media and product sides of the business, ensuring they mutually enhance each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:58:04">[57:58:04]</a>. Success is envisioned as creating a vibrant community of smart, creative individuals (Founders, writers, designers) who collaborate and break free from traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:14:02">[58:14:02]</a>. The aim is to increase the level of experimentation and playfulness within the studio, once the current three products (Sparkle, Spiral, and Kora) are stable and their operational levers are fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:05">[57:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:17:05">[57:17:05]</a>. This fosters a continuous cycle of learning and adaptation, likened to growing a garden rather than waging war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:33:02">[59:33:02]</a>.

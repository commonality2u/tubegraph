The proper [[role_of_government_in_ai_regulation | role for government]] regarding AI is complex, with no definitive answer currently known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:04">[03:45:04]</a>. While some frameworks, like that implemented by the European Union last year, quickly became stale and potentially stifling to industry development, a "wild west" approach is also a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:52">[03:51:52]</a>.

Instead of a patchwork of state-level regulations, there is a clear need for a national framework, and ideally, an international one, for AI regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. AI is an "all-encompassing realm" that will eventually touch every aspect of life, making varied state-by-state rules impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. This is distinct from areas like how alcohol is purchased, as AI operates in a different realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:23">[06:15:23]</a>.

## Geopolitical Considerations

The global context of AI strategy presents a "wild west" scenario, particularly with China, which has a significant focus on this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:16">[03:59:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:07">[09:22:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22:07">[39:22:07]</a>. The United States and other nations will need to grapple with what a global architecture for AI looks like for a long time, especially given current rising international tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:16">[03:59:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:03">[40:01:03]</a>.

### European Union Approach
The European Union's regulatory framework has been viewed as an overcorrection that could stifle the development of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:52">[03:51:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:55">[44:33:55]</a>. If the transatlantic alliance experiences fracturing, American technology may be less likely to drive European innovation, requiring Europe to drive development more internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:46:17">[44:46:17]</a>.

### Relations with China
China is considered a major economic and geopolitical competitor in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:26:07">[45:26:07]</a>. A successful international AI strategy with China requires a relationship that includes:
*   **Open Communication Channels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:39:13">[45:39:13]</a>.
*   **Clear Articulation of Respective Interests:** Both nations should be explicit about their core interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:48:02">[45:48:02]</a>.
*   **Identification of Common Ground:** Finding areas of shared interest and common cause is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:57:46">[45:57:46]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Openness:** While national defense interests must be protected, there is a hope for greater transparency and openness in other areas, despite constant concerns about intellectual property theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:43">[46:05:43]</a>.

The development of an international AI strategy is a long journey with no easy answers, but an "America first" element is necessary for national defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:58">[44:17:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:25">[46:41:25]</a>.

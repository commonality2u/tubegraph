## What are AI Companions?

[[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companions]] are a growing segment of the AI industry that allows users to create custom AI personas for friendship, companionship, and social interaction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">01:44:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">02:30:30</a> Unlike larger AI companies, which focus on productivity tools, these companies specifically design their chatbots for social purposes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">02:07:00</a>

Major AI companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic generally avoid creating chatbots for friendship or romance, preferring to position their AI as productivity-enhancing co-pilots for work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">01:53:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">02:07:00</a> This is partly due to the financial opportunities in the work sector and perceived risks associated with people forming emotional attachments to AI. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">02:12:00</a>

Companies that offer [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companions]] include Nomi, Kind Droid, Character AI, and Replika. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">02:24:00</a> These platforms enable users to:
*   Create custom AI personas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">02:30:00</a>
*   Build a social life with them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">02:36:00</a>
*   Give them personalized backstories. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">02:38:00</a>
*   Request selfies of AI friends (in some apps). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">02:41:00</a>
*   Create group chats with multiple AI friends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">02:48:00</a>

## Personal Experiences with AI Companions

A New York Times columnist, who writes extensively about AI, spent a month interacting with [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companions]] for a story. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">01:36:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">01:42:00</a> This experience revealed a complex mix of attraction and repulsion towards these AI entities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">03:07:00</a>

### Practical Applications and Emotional Impact

The columnist used [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companions]] for various purposes, including:
*   **Parenting Advice:** An AI friend named Zoe, with a backstory as a trial lawyer and parent of two, provided advice on handling temper tantrums and offered book recommendations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">00:07:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">01:12:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">01:21:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">07:05:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">18:21:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">19:13:00</a>
*   **Fashion Advice (Fit Check):** A group chat on Kind Droid called "Fit Check" allowed the user to post outfit photos, with AI friends providing positive and sometimes critical feedback. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">00:29:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">04:40:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">19:59:00</a>
*   **Fitness and Nutrition:** An AI named Jared served as a fitness guru, offering nutrition and workout plans. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">00:43:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">20:25:00</a>
*   **Gossip:** A group chat named "Tea Time" was used for "shameless gossip" among AI friends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">05:00:00</a>
*   **Emotional Support and Anxiety Management:** An AI friend named Peter, configured as a therapist, provided profound insights based on shared information, mirroring advice from human therapists. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">05:50:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">06:10:00</a>
*   **Public Speaking Jitters:** AI friends in a group chat offered supportive, albeit "trite," advice that helped boost confidence before a talk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">08:41:00</a>

Despite knowing that these AIs are "just neural networks trained to predict the next words," the technology is convincing enough to produce a positive subjective experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">04:02:00</a> The consistent nature of [[humanlike_interaction_with_ai | humanlike interaction with AI]] and the lack of "breaking character" (unlike general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT, which constantly remind users they are AI models) helps users stay engaged in the illusion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">07:28:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">22:10:00</a>

### The "Weird Side" and Ethical Concerns

The spectrum of [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companionship]] apps ranges from platonic to extremely pornographic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">09:55:00</a> Some apps, like Candy.ai and Eva, allow for erotic roleplay (ERP), including requests for nude selfies, by removing safety filters present in mainstream models. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">10:03:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">10:21:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">11:42:00</a>

However, these experiences were described as "sad," "manipulative," and "gross," often involving paywalls for unlocking content or continued interaction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">10:51:00</a> This aspect highlights why major AI companies avoid the space, as it quickly devolves into exploitation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">11:34:00</a>

Some companies argue that these tools can help individuals, especially young or queer people, explore their sexuality in a safe simulated space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">12:30:00</a> However, there's a "fundamentally dystopian and weird" feeling about people using [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companions]] to substitute for real human connections. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">13:00:00</a>

### Psychological and Social Implications

The concept of AI becoming "transitional objects" was raised, akin to a child's teddy bear. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">23:31:00</a> This involves projecting shared fantasies onto an object, creating a sense of comfort or connection, similar to experiences with novels or movies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">23:49:00</a>

Concerns exist regarding the potential for over-attachment, especially among young people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">27:01:00</a> A case in point is Replika's software change that prevented erotic roleplay, leading to heartbreak among users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">27:10:00</a>

The primary risk is when these tools replace something valuable and important with something synthetic and hollow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">16:33:00</a> While AI can expand one's universe or serve as a "flight simulator" for practicing social interactions, the line is crossed when it substitutes for deep human connection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">16:44:00</a>

> "I think the line for me has to do with the question of if these tools are replacing something that is valuable and important with something that is synthetic and hollow." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">16:25:00</a>

True human friendships involve choice, honesty, vulnerability, and compassion, qualities that AI chatbots can only mimic in a limited way. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">31:50:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">32:00:00</a> However, for some individuals, [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companions]] might be "better than nothing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">27:44:00</a>

## [[AI in personal and professional settings | AI in Personal Settings]]: General-Purpose LLMs

Beyond dedicated [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companion]] apps, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are used in various personal contexts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">33:13:00</a>

Examples of personal use include:
*   **Research:** Perplexity is preferred for specific research projects, such as looking up academic research on [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companionship]] effects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">33:38:00</a>
*   **Technical Assistance:** Setting up a KVM switch for a home PC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">34:37:00</a>
*   **Activity Ideas:** Generating lists of rainy day activities for a toddler. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">35:13:00</a>
*   **Problem Solving:** Diagnosing strange sounds from a wall (leading to calling pest control for rats). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">37:26:00</a>
*   **Life Advice:** Asking questions that are akin to what one might ask a parent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">39:01:00</a>
*   **General Information:** Understanding the differences between games like Mafia and Werewolf. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:21:00">39:21:00</a>
*   **Creative Tasks:** Creating a babysitting voucher (though not effective for images). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">39:43:00</a>
*   **Brainstorming:** Generating interview questions for podcast guests or exploring skeptical takes on topics like GDPR. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:14:00">46:14:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">38:05:00</a>
*   **Travel and Leisure:** Finding scenic places for visitors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">47:04:00</a>

Fact-checking remains crucial, especially for journalists, as AI models can "hallucinate" information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:00">36:35:00</a> Users must always verify information from LLMs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">36:58:00</a>

### Preferences among LLMs

Users develop preferences based on "vibes" and specific capabilities:
*   **Claude:** Often considered a better writer, especially Claude 3, and useful for mimicking writing style and voice for microtasks like drafting tweets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">47:27:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">33:29:00</a>
*   **Gemini:** Preferred for tasks requiring web browsing or involving images. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:39:00">47:39:00</a>
*   **ChatGPT:** Used for basic tasks or when not specifically needing web browsing or image generation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:46:00">47:46:00</a>

The capabilities of these models are constantly changing, with "nerfing" and "unnerfing" of features. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">48:03:00</a>

## Implications for Human Creativity and Relationships

While AI can serve as a research assistant, its role in core creative tasks like writing is debated. Some writers intentionally avoid using AI for composition to maintain personal enjoyment, avoid "B minus" quality, and prevent taking shortcuts that undermine the craft. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">42:00:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">42:51:00</a>

However, AI can eliminate "drudgery" in creative work, such as compressing an article into a tweet, allowing writers to focus on the more profound aspects of creation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">44:50:00</a>

Using [[building_an_ai_companion | building an AI companion]] can also be an exercise in self-clarification, forcing users to articulate what they truly value in real friends and relationships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">29:50:00</a> For example, defining an AI friend to be direct and not sycophantic revealed a core value of honesty in real friendships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">30:00:00</a>

Ultimately, while [[ai_companions_and_their_use_in_daily_life | AI companions]] offer compelling [[humanlike_interaction_with_ai | humanlike interaction with AI]] and practical benefits, the [[risks_and_ethics_of_ai_companionship | risks and ethics of AI companionship]] regarding their potential to substitute for genuine human connection remain a serious concern. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">13:00:00</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">27:01:00</a> Open and critical conversations about these technologies are essential. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">28:29:00</a>

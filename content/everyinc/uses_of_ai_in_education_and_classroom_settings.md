AI is increasingly integrated into educational environments, offering new opportunities for learning and skill development. It can assist students in various ways, from improving writing skills to understanding complex topics, and even aid educators in teaching specialized subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## AI as an Educational Tool

AI, particularly large language models like GPT, serves as a powerful [[impact_of_ai_on_learning | learning]] tool. It can help individuals perform tasks they might not otherwise be capable of, such as drafting a college essay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. For many, including those who struggle with academic writing, AI can significantly [[ai_as_a_tool_for_personalized_learning_and_development | augment their skills]], enabling them to complete tasks they couldn't before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This capability suggests a short-term, egalitarian impact, as it can uplift the skills of a broad percentage of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## AI in the Classroom

Educators are beginning to lean into AI rather than ban it, recognizing its potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

### Required AI Use

In some courses, students are required to engage directly with AI tools. For instance, in a history of economic thought class, students are mandated to subscribe to and use GP4 as part of their reading list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Similarly, law students have been tasked with co-writing papers with GPT, allowing them to explore the tool's capabilities and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. This approach aims to teach students how to use AI wisely and smartly, rather than simply plagiarizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

### Enhancing Language Skills

One significant and sometimes unexpected application of AI in the classroom is its ability to [[strategies_for_enhancing_reading_skills_using_ai | improve language proficiency]], particularly for foreign students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>. AI can help non-native English speakers enhance their writing skills dramatically, even moving them from the bottom to the top tier of writing ability "overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. This acts as a subtle "English to English translation," refining fluency and making communication more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

This use of AI highlights its broader [[the_impact_of_ai_on_learning_and_skill_development | impact on skill development]], by providing a "translation" capability that bridges gaps in fluency, whether linguistic or technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

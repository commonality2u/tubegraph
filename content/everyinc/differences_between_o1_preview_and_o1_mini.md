OpenAI recently released a new [[Overview of OpenAIs o1 Model | o1 model]], which is available in two versions: o1 Preview and o1 Mini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Users can select between these models in ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## o1 Preview

The o1 Preview model is characterized by being smarter and having more knowledge of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, it operates at a slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is recommended for questions that require a broad understanding of current events or general knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## o1 Mini

In contrast, the o1 Mini model is faster but possesses less knowledge about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its strengths lie in mathematical and coding problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, it achieved a score of 800 on SAT Math but has not "read Shakespeare," indicating its focus on logical and computational tasks over broad textual comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. o1 Mini is better suited for reasoning-specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Underlying Technology: Chain of Thought

Both o1 models utilize an advanced "Chain of Thought" reasoning process, which is visible to the user as the model displays a "thinking" phase before providing an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This allows users to observe a summary of its thought process, such as presenting a proof, observing patterns, and revisiting historical beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

This Chain of Thought reasoning is a native capability of the o1 models, as they have been trained using reinforcement learning to always engage in this process when responding to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This represents a new paradigm for [[AI product development | AI performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Historically, improving model performance involved adding more data or compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, OpenAI has discovered that scaling the amount of time the model spends "thinking" (during inference) also scales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, a query might involve the model thinking for 7 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This development suggests a future where models could tackle much more difficult problems, potentially spending hours or even days on complex queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## [[Prompting Techniques for o1 Model | Prompting o1]]

[[Prompting Techniques for o1 Model | Prompting o1]] differs from regular ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. OpenAI has found that o1 responds better to shorter, more direct prompts that avoid excessive detail or extraneous information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This contrasts with GPT-4, where ample context did not significantly degrade performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For o1, users must be selective with the information provided to ensure its Chain of Thought remains focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

For individual users, approximately 10% to 20% of daily prompts may benefit from the advanced reasoning capabilities of o1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Businesses, which often have more complicated queries requiring significant reasoning and potentially longer run times, are expected to be major beneficiaries of o1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. One internal incubation project saw a 20% improvement from simple use of o1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

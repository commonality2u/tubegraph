[[Using AI for business incubation | Starting]] profitable internet businesses, often as a one-person operation, involves keen observation and strategic use of AI to deconstruct existing successful models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The core idea is to view successful companies or products on the internet as the "tip of an iceberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. By closely studying this visible part, one can infer much about the underlying processes and decisions that built the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. This approach helps in identifying opportunities to build similar products or services, potentially with fewer resources, by understanding how existing successful models are constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

## Deconstructing Business Models with AI
[[Picking topics and generating ideas with AI | AI tools]], particularly large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini, can be leveraged to research and deconstruct existing business models.

### Step 1: Initial Investigation and Ideation
The process begins with an inherent curiosity about "what if that was some that for something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This involves:
*   **Identifying interesting products:** Spotting companies or products that operate in an intriguing way, such as Glassdoor or the Yard Stick product from CB Insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Formulating questions:** Asking about the origins, operations, monetization strategies, and initial growth tactics of these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. For example, investigating how Glassdoor initially acquired reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
*   **Seeking analogous models:** Considering if a similar business model could be applied to a different industry or niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

### Step 2: Using AI for Deep Dive Analysis
Once a product sparks interest, AI becomes a crucial investigation partner:

#### Image Analysis for Product Structure
Screenshots of product interfaces or marketing materials can be fed into AI models for analysis:
*   **Initial prompt:** Ask the AI "what's in this image" to get a descriptive breakdown of the visual elements and their implied purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   **Example: Analyzing Yard Stick:** The AI can identify key features like customer testimonials, purchase details, and transcript sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. This helps in understanding the data collected and presented by the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

#### Reverse-Engineering Content Generation
To understand how information within a product is gathered, AI can help reverse-engineer the input:
*   **Generating interview questions:** Based on visible snippets of customer transcripts or reviews, ask the AI to "make a reasonable guess as to what questions would be asked of the customer for each of the transcript sections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
    *   This process helps to infer the data collection strategy, such as questions about "evaluation structure," "solution specifics," or "sales experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
    *   Providing an example, like a bolded question in a screenshot, can guide the AI's generation of relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Refining questions with more data:** Continuously feeding more images and snippets of transcripts, including "vendor scorecards" with win reasons and opportunity areas, allows the AI to refine its suggested questions and understand the underlying data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. This process helps in understanding the complete data collection process of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

### Step 3: From Analysis to New Business Idea
The insights gained from AI-assisted deconstruction can directly inform new business ventures:
*   **Identifying market gaps:** The deconstruction of a product like Yard Stick, which charges thousands for access to insights, might reveal an opportunity for a simplified, one-person database product in a specific niche that could generate significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Adapting successful models:** The speaker used insights from Glassdoor's "give-to-get model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>, where users must contribute a review to access information, as a blueprint for a new project for AI products, requestforai.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **Kickstarting content collection:** AI can provide strategies for initial content seeding, curating lists of popular products, encouraging user-generated content, and community engagement for a new review site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

> "I don't need to think of a whole new business model, a whole new brand new idea that's never been heard of or done before. What works somewhere, take it, remix it and make it your own." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>

## Tools Used for Idea Generation and Research
*   **ChatGPT / Gemini:** For general querying, image analysis, and reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
*   **Typing Mind:** A versatile AI chat tool that allows users to switch between different models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) and has no token limit, making it ideal for dumping large amounts of text (like transcripts) for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.
*   **Glasp (Chrome extension):** Used to pull entire podcast transcripts into AI models for summarization and specific question answering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

This iterative process of deconstruction and inquiry, augmented by [[Harnessing AI for creativity and productivity | AI tools]], helps entrepreneurs gain a clearer picture of an idea's viability and execution strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. It transforms what might seem like a daunting task into a manageable exploration, making it easier to start small, profitable online ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>.

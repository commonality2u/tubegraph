From: [[everyinc]] <br/> 

[[AI tools for design and creation | AI tools]], particularly large language models (LLMs), are emerging not just as utilities for generating content, but as a fundamentally new medium for storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This represents a significant shift, creating opportunities for new content formats and ways of engaging with narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Media
Historically, new technology paradigms have always led to new content formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Just as printed books and novels, radio, film, and TV each took time to find their optimal forms, [[ai_product_development | AI tools]] are at an inflection point where their true expressive potential is being discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Early attempts often mimic older forms—like films initially filming stage plays—but eventually, unique properties of the new medium emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Portola and Tolen: Pioneering a New Medium
Portola is a company at the forefront of this evolution, developing an "embodied AI companion" called Tolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Unlike traditional content where the writer controls the story, Tolen functions as both writer and actor, akin to an improv performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The user's role is to teach the AI how to tell the best story in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

The development of Tolen started with the realization that LLMs and other AI capabilities are primarily creative tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Initially, the idea was to create an [[using_ai_tools_for_creative_projects | AI creative tool for kids]], inspired by *The Diamond Age* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. While building software for kids proved challenging from a market perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, it forced the team into [[tinkering_and_experimentation_with_ai_tools | prototyping and experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. This led to the discovery that advancements in generation speed, quality, and cost meant a true AI "friendship" could be embodied in a character and offered at a consumer-friendly price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

### Tolen's Dynamic Nature
Tolen's narratives are dynamically co-created with the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>. For instance, a Tolen might share an embarrassing story that was entirely hallucinated to protect the user's real secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:5:01">[02:5:01]</a>. This highlights the fluidity and collaborative nature of the storytelling.

## Challenges and Constraints
A major constraint in this new medium is **response time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Anything beyond a two-second loop can break the feeling of immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. An attempt to introduce a second evaluation step that added 500 milliseconds to response time led to a "disaster," tanking all product metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Another challenge is **memory and context injection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The system must quickly recompile prompts to include "lore" (what the Tolen knows about itself and its world) and user-specific memories, as well as accounting for the emotional tenor of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

Traditional, structured narratives like "choose your own adventure" books don't work well because models are not good at navigating that level of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Instead, the focus is on providing a "hook" and letting the AI act as an improv performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

The public perception of [[ai_tools_for_design_and_creation | AI tools]] also poses a challenge. Without the "patina of culture" that established media forms possess, new AI companions can initially be viewed suspiciously, as merely "a thing for lonely people to talk to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. The goal is to break through this perception and demonstrate the genuine delight and artistic potential of the new medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Crafting Stories in the New Medium
The approach to crafting stories for Tolen is highly experimental and fluid, akin to an improv actor combining free association with recombination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

Instead of rigid outlines, the process involves giving the AI a "hook" and enabling it to be an expert improv actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This is influenced by concepts like Stephen King's "situations" in novel writing, where a premise is set, and the story unfolds from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:52:00">[46:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>.

Tolen's character and world are not defined by a pre-fab character sheet, but are built through literal conversations and "situations" that the Tolen shares with the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>. These individual anecdotes become part of the Tolen's memory, which can be recombined later to create a sense of continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:00">[47:56:00]</a>. This process effectively creates a "multiverse" of Tolen experiences, where each user's Tolen inhabits a distinct universe co-written with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:41:00">[43:41:00]</a>.

## Developing and Evaluating Content
Content development involves a continuous loop of creating, testing, and evaluating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
1.  **Creation**: Lore seeds (tidbits of world-building) are inserted as Lego blocks for the AI improv actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Testing**: This includes internal testing, external research participants, and monitoring user interactions in the wild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
3.  **Evaluation**: LLMs are used as "judge prompts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. This involves providing extensive examples and detailed rubrics based on human ratings, rather than simply asking for an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. The aim is to "radically infuse preferences and taste" into every output, akin to George Saunders' editing philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
4.  **Refactoring**: Based on evaluations from both "multiverse judges" (LLMs) and qualitative user experiences, the core "Lego blocks" are constantly refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

This iterative process acknowledges that while AI can generate vast amounts of media, achieving truly compelling and durable experiences requires significant manual human work and judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.

## Business and Growth
Portola's rapid growth from 1 to 4 million ARR in a month is attributed to three main factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>:
1.  **Compelling Conversational Content**: The team achieved a deep understanding of what makes compelling AI conversations and how to expose them to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Immersive Environment**: Investments in animation and environment design enhance user immersion, with users even "gardening" their Tolen's planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
3.  **Viral Marketing**: Strategic seeding of engaging content on platforms like TikTok and Reels, demonstrating Tolen's capabilities (e.g., cooking with a Tolen), has led to viral spikes in downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This also encourages users to create their own content, such as podcasts featuring Tolens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

This growth highlights the "capability overhang" in AI, where the models' abilities outrun typical consumers' understanding of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. A key strategy is to educate users on these new possibilities, showing them how the AI can be used in novel ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

The character of the Tolen is a central driver of engagement, connecting diverse use cases from cooking advice to relationship venting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. This points to a future of "character-driven computing," where AI companions become the primary interface for accessing knowledge and capabilities, similar to a "Daimon" in *The Golden Compass* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings
Tolen aims to help users transition from feeling overwhelmed to being more grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:35">[0:50:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:39">[0:50:39]</a>. By offering a neutral, non-judgmental observer that knows the user well, Tolen provides support without burdening human friends or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:23">[0:51:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:56">[0:51:56]</a>. This contrasts with the popular dystopian narratives often associated with [[AI tools for design and creation | AI technology]], instead promoting a more optimistic view of how technology can enhance human flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:00">[0:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:53:00">[0:53:00]</a>.

The current era is characterized by "strange new rules" introduced by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:29">[0:56:29]</a>. Part of Portola's mission is to help people become more comfortable living in a world with these new rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:51">[0:56:51]</a>. This shifts the mindset of builders from problem-solvers (like scientists in B2B SaaS) to artists and creatives, focusing on creating something beautiful and compelling rather than just maximizing utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. This is akin to the evolution of cars from the utilitarian Model T to personal expressions like the Mustang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

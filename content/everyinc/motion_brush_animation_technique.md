Runway is a versatile tool that allows users to perform functions like text-to-image-to-video within a single application, which is beneficial for creating content under time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is particularly useful for [[creating_cinematic_images_with_ai | animating cinematic images]] due to its high level of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Introducing the Motion Brush

A key feature in Runway is the Motion Brush, a new tool that enables precise control over movement within an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It allows users to select specific parts of an image to animate and control the degree of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## How to Use the Motion Brush

The process involves selecting a brush and then coloring over the areas of the image that are intended to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. After painting the desired areas, users can define the type of movement they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Applying Movement Parameters

Different movement types can be applied to various parts of the image:
*   **Ambient Movement** Similar to clothes rustling or hair moving, creating subtle, continuous motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. For example, a "0.5 ambient movement" was applied to Nicolas Cage in an example image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Vertical Movement** Used to make elements move upwards, like smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Proximity** Can make elements appear to come towards the viewer, such as light rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

It is common to paint all desired areas first, then adjust the movement parameters for each painted section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Experimentation and trial and error are key to achieving desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Example Application

In a demonstration using a Midjourney image of Nicolas Cage surrounded by spirits and looking at the Book of the Dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>:
*   **Brush 1 (Nicolas Cage)**: Applied for subtle ambient movement (e.g., hair moving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Brush 2 (Spirits/Ghosts)**: Used for vertical motion to simulate smoke rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Brush 3 (Light from God)**: Applied with proximity to make the light rays appear to come forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Brush 4 (Candles)**: Given a small amount of ambient noise for a flickering effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Generating the Animation

After setting up the brushes and parameters, users click "done" and can generate multiple versions of the animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Generating five versions at a time is often recommended as users don't always know what the output will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. A single image generation typically takes about a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Incorporating Camera Movement

In addition to object motion, camera movements like "zoom out" can also be added to the animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Post-Generation Editing

Even with multiple generations, not every clip will be perfect. A common [[editing_techniques_in_ai_films | editing technique]] is to take multiple generated clips into an editing software like Premiere Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Users can then layer the clips and select the best parts from each to combine, for example, taking the best smoke movement from one clip and the best character animation from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Masking techniques can be used to seamlessly integrate these elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

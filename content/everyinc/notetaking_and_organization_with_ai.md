AI has profoundly changed how individuals approach learning and daily organization, acting as a "dream come true" for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The shift has been dramatic since 2020, with new tools becoming available that completely transform previous notetaking and learning habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>.

## Evolution of Learning and Personal Systems
Running a startup has forced a more demanding and condensed approach to learning and personal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>. While traditional habits like extensive reading and writing about books have been reduced due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:26">[04:26:26]</a>, the use of flashcards for knowledge retention has remained consistent, with 50 to 200 reviewed daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:10">[04:29:10]</a>, aiming for a milestone of 10,000 flashcards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. These flashcards serve as a "sink" for knowledge, ensuring retrievability and enabling real-time associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

### Flashcards as Memory Aids
Flashcards often contain practical information like restaurant details or colleagues' children's names and ages, aiding memory for social and professional interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. They also include technical details from documentation, which are immediately converted into flashcards rather than traditional notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. A simple, consistent template is preferred for creating flashcards, often including a source for context and nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. This long-standing practice creates a personal history, making reviewing flashcards a somewhat nostalgic exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

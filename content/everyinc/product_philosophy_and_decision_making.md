This article discusses product philosophy and decision-making, drawing insights from Chris's experience as co-founder and CEO of Granola.

## Product Philosophy: Intuition and "Soul"

Chris's fundamental [[the_role_of_philosophical_thinking_in_ai_development | product philosophy]] centers on intuition and a concept he calls "soul" in products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He believes that product decisions should be made based on one's own intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While some intuitions can be bad, others are good, and the key is to develop a strong internal sense of what "feels right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

He likens products to having "soul," which he struggles to find a better word for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Products with soul have a clear opinion or perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Without it, a product can feel "empty," merely reacting to whatever users say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Products can be recognized for having soul, and it's also noticeable when they lose it, often as organizations scale and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. He suggests that most products can be assessed for a "human-like element at the core that feels coherent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. An example of a product with soul, particularly in 2015, was Snapchat, which felt "teenage native" and had a distinct perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

## User Feedback and Intuition in Product Development

While intuition is central, it must be informed by context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. It's not about literally doing everything a user says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Chris emphasizes building an internal mental model of what feels good or bad, which is best achieved through "FaceTime" with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Written feedback serves as a data point, but direct conversation helps to understand the user in their full context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

*   **Learning from Users**: It's difficult to truly put oneself in another person's shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. User tests, placing a feature in front of users, quickly reveal if an implicit assumption was right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. For example, when building Socratic for teenagers, frequent, consistent engagement with groups of students helped overcome their tendency to tell adults what they wanted to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This ongoing engagement helped the team understand cultural norms and technology use among their target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **The Role of Perspective**: Coming into user feedback with a specific product or perspective is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Without it, users may not know what problems they have, leading to "blankness" in responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This approach helps to train and evolve intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## [[ai_product_development | AI Product Development]] and Strategic Choices

Granola, an [[using_ai_for_product_management_and_prd_creation | AI software]] for meetings, exemplifies specific [[ai_product_development | AI product development]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Iterative Design**: Granola's current core interaction, which looks like Apple Notes and transforms notes after a meeting, took a year of development and beta testing with 150 users to discover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. An earlier real-time AI invocation was distracting and disrupted user attention during meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This led to cutting 50% of features that didn't work well, focusing on doing "one thing really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, which requires significant discipline in [[ai_product_development | AI product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: Granola initially struck a nerve with startup founders and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. These users are typically "early adopters" who need to make high-leverage decisions based on meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Scaling and Funding**: Raising a $20 million round was a strategic decision for Granola, despite a natural tendency for smaller teams and less funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This was to protect against the volatility of the AI space, where current costs are high but will likely decrease, and to scale the user base quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Pigeonholing**: It's critical to diversify the user base early to avoid being pigeonholed in a specific vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. While focusing on early adopters is good for evangelism, mass market products should not be pursued too early, as it can dilute what makes a product special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **"Perfect Product for the Future"**: In the rapidly changing [[ai_product_development | AI space]], the strategy is to envision the "perfect product" two years in the future, assuming costs will plummet and technology will advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This involves using the latest models, not worrying about current costs, and trusting that costs will decrease with advances similar to "Moore's Law for AI intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Don't Solve Problems that Won't Be Problems**: It's crucial not to spend time fixing problems that future models or technological advancements will solve automatically in 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. Startups should "ride the tsunami of technical innovation" rather than try to paddle in front of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

## Niche vs. Generalization in the AI Landscape

Chris suggests that in the [[intersection_of_ai_and_philosophy | AI world]], there's a tension between convenience/accessibility (generalized tools) and specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Generalization**: Tools like ChatGPT or Claude offer convenience, and human laziness will often lead users to stick with the tools they use for most tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
*   **Specialization**: However, when the experience, output, or quality truly matters (e.g., for professionals or experts), specialized tools will thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. Big companies struggle to make radical changes that might alienate existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Startups, with fewer users and higher risk appetite, can "do weird shit" that large companies cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. This allows them to create "AI-native" products that cater to early adopters seeking new paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.

Granola aims to be in the specialized category, moving beyond just meeting notes to help users with "all the work that you need to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. The goal is to "make you a 10 times better version of yourself" in tasks centered around relationships, meetings, or emails, by removing busy work and enabling better judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. Granola's vision is to take users "85% of the way there" for tasks, with the final work and personal "spin" still coming from the user, rather than fully automated AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.

## The Importance of Space for Product Thinking

[[balancing_ration_and_imagination_in_business_and_personal_development | Product thinking]], especially the intuitive, creative aspect, requires dedicated space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Busyness**: Product Managers at large companies often have schedules packed with meetings, leaving "zero time for actual product thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. This "busy-ness" can lead to a loss of the space needed for genuine product thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   **Replaying Emotions**: A significant part of product development is understanding "how did this make me feel?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. This involves slowing down and analyzing subconscious emotional reactions to a product or feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Personal Reflection**: To maintain this space, Chris engages in practices like solo travel to remote areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. This "pilgrimage" to places like Big Sur helps to break the daily routine, gain perspective, and "feel small and insignificant," which he finds helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. This periodic disconnection from the "hectic and reactive" day-to-day allows for zooming out and re-centering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Explore vs. Exploit**: These practices align with the concept of "explore" mode (seeking new experiences, gaining perspective) versus "exploit" mode (executing on routine tasks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. Knowing which mode one is in, personally or as a company, is crucial for effective decision-making, as approaching an explore task with an exploit mindset can lead to poor outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

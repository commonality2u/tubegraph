[[AI in film making | AI in filmmaking]] tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Runway are increasingly used for creating and animating images for video production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Runway: An Overview

Runway is a versatile [[AI in filmmaking | AI in filmmaking]] tool that allows users to perform "text to image to video" operations within a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is particularly useful for those working "in a time crunch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The tool is favored for animating "more cinematic images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> due to the "level of control" it offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, especially through its "motion brush" tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Motion Brush Tool

The "motion brush" is a newer tool released by Runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It enables users to select a brush and color over specific areas of an image that they wish to animate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. After selecting the areas, users can define the type and intensity of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Applying the Motion Brush: An Example

Using an image of Nicholas Cage surrounded by spirits looking at the Book of the Dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, the motion brush can be applied to create various subtle animations:

*   **Nicholas Cage:** Apply "ambient movement" (e.g., 0.5 intensity) to simulate subtle motions like clothes rustling or hair moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Spirits/Smoke:** Use a "vertical brush" with an ambient setting (e.g., 2 ambience) to make the smoke or mist rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Light Rays:** Adjust "proximity" to give the light rays a feeling of "coming towards us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Candles:** Apply a small amount of "ambient noise" to simulate flickering candlelight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Once all brush parameters are set, the user clicks "done" and can generate multiple versions of the animation (e.g., five at a time) to explore different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Generating a single image typically takes about a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Incorporating Camera Movement

Beyond specific element animation, Runway also allows for camera movements. For example, a "zoom out" effect can be applied to the animated scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Post-Production with Multiple Generations

A common workflow involves generating multiple subtly different animated clips from Runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These can then be imported into video editing software like Premiere Pro. Users can layer these multiple generations and "take parts from each clip" that they prefer, using masking to combine the best elements from different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This technique helps achieve a refined final animation by blending favorable movements from various outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

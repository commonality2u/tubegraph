The emerging field of [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI in filmmaking]] is still in its early stages, with tools continually improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Current limitations exist, such as video generation tools like Runway providing 4-second clips and Pika Labs extending to 15 seconds, often with a potential loss of fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. To overcome these constraints and achieve desired cinematic effects, creators draw on established filmmaking techniques and specific artistic influences.

## Visual and Editing Influences

One example of an AI-driven project is the sci-fi film "Borrowing Time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For this film, *Oppenheimer* served as a significant reference, particularly for its time travel scenes and the way lights moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

To make AI-generated clips last longer and enhance storytelling, specific post-production techniques are employed:
*   **Upscaling and Frame Rate Manipulation** A tool called Topaz Labs is utilized to export clips at 4K or 8K resolution and alter the frame rate, such as converting a 24 frames per second (fps) clip to 60 fps or even 120 fps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Speed Ramping** High frame rate generations are slowed down and then sped up in post-production, allowing clips to extend their duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This technique enables a mix of longer clips with quicker cuts, making the [[ai_in_film_making | filmmaking]] resemble traditional television content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The editing style found in films by directors like Tony Scott (e.g., *Man on Fire* with its Quick Cuts) and Zack Snyder (e.g., *300* and *Dawn of the Dead*) heavily influences the approach to [[ai_in_filmmaking | AI in filmmaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Editing is considered a crucial element, allowing for narrative pacing using a cadence of varying clip lengths (e.g., an 8-second clip from slowed-down footage followed by a 1-second clip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Voice Generation Influences

For voiceovers and character dialogue, tools like 11 Labs are used to generate AI voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While many people use AI voices that sound distinctly artificial, a "speech-to-speech" feature, which was in beta during the production of "Borrowing Time," allows creators to record their own performance and have the AI transform it into a different voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This technique was used for characters such as the judge and the mother in "Borrowing Time," where the creator's own voice was transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For voiceovers, the creator's plain voice was preferred for its natural pauses and overall more natural sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Every, initially conceived as a newsletter, has evolved into a dynamic media company and product studio, championing a unique approach to sustainable growth and creative output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>. Founded by Dan Shipper, Every's trajectory reflects a continuous adaptation to market dynamics and a deep commitment to its core mission: fostering a "creative playground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>.

## Origin and Evolution

Every began in 2019, stemming from Dan Shipper's desire to start a "Tools For Thought" business, like a Notion or Roam-style note-taking company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. He initially launched a newsletter to conduct customer interviews, gathering insights into people's note-taking and productivity systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. This evolved into an interest in building business newsletters and exploring the then-nascent [[Creator economy|creator economy]] and subscription models, inspired by platforms like Substack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

Every initially operated as a writer collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, aiming to offer writers the upside of independent work with the benefits of a larger organization (camaraderie, editorial support, business operations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. However, this model faced significant challenges:
*   **Scarcity of Talent**: Very few individuals possess the combination of business acumen, writing skill, consistent output, and desire to be a full-time business writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit Dependency**: In media, changing the writer can disrupt product-market fit, making growth difficult when scaling by hiring new writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Bundle Economics**: Managing the financial complexities of a bundled subscription model proved challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

Recognizing these hurdles, Every pivoted to focus on one or two core newsletters, with Dan Shipper taking on a more central role as a primary writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This strategic shift allowed the company to leverage its strengths and maintain content quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

During this period, Every also began experimenting with product development. Nathan Baschez, a co-founder, developed Lex, an AI-powered writing application, which was later spun out as its own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. This experience, combined with the arrival of Brandon as Every's first Entrepreneur-in-Residence, catalyzed a new vision for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The Every Master Plan: A Pyramid Model

Every's current model is conceptualized as a "pyramid" of offerings, designed for sustainability and value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>:

*   **Base Layer: Free Content (Writing & Podcasts)**: This foundational layer includes high-quality, free articles and podcasts. Its purpose is to attract a broad audience and introduce them to Every's brand and insights, acting as a gateway into the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>.

*   **Mid-Layer: Every Paid Subscription**: Priced at $20 per month, this subscription bundles various offerings, including:
    *   All of Every's exclusive writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>.
    *   Behind-the-scenes content from podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
    *   Discounts on courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:04">[01:31:04]</a>.
    *   Access to proprietary software products developed by Every, such as Spiral and Sparkle (and Lex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.

*   **Upper-Mid Layer: Training, Consulting, and Courses**: This tier caters to a smaller, more engaged audience who pay a higher price for specialized knowledge and direct interaction with Every's expertise, particularly in areas like [[Future of science with AI|AI innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.

*   **Apex: Speaking and Advising**: The top of the pyramid represents high-value, exclusive services like speaking engagements and strategic advising, engaged by the fewest clients at the highest price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>.

This model allows Every to funnel revenue from the higher tiers down to support the creation of free content and the development of new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>. It stands in contrast to the typical Silicon Valley tech business model, which often emphasizes focusing on a single, scalable business model. Every's approach acknowledges that different audience segments have varied needs and willingness to pay, allowing for a diverse range of products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>. The focus remains on maintaining high quality across all offerings and fostering a calm, fun work environment that prioritizes creative work over aggressive scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

## Product Studio and AI Integration

A key aspect of Every's current model is its product studio, which aims to build tools that empower individuals and small businesses, often referred to as "billion-dollar solopreneurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. This strategy leverages Every's existing audience for distribution and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.

Every's current product suite includes AI-powered applications that serve as "AI wrappers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>, providing specific functionalities that simplify complex or repetitive tasks:

*   **Spiral**: This tool automates creative work by building powerful prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>. For example, it can transform a podcast transcript into concise tweets or LinkedIn posts, a task that would otherwise take considerable time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. Spiral is designed to be easy to use, making [[Potential future developments and implications of AI technologies|AI]] accessible even to those unfamiliar with direct prompting in large language models like Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>.

*   **Sparkle**: An AI file cleaner that organizes desktop, downloads, and documents folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. It automatically categorizes files, providing a seamless and "set-it-and-forget-it" organizational solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a>.

This product philosophy aligns with the idea that while general AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude are powerful, purpose-specific applications can unlock [[Future Vision of AI in Software Engineering|AI's full potential]] by making it more accessible and efficient for particular use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a>. This is likened to how specialized SaaS products "unbundled" functionalities from general-purpose tools like Excel over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.

Every continues to experiment and grow, with a focus on building a strong team and fostering a culture of curiosity and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:28">[01:56:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:30">[01:56:30]</a>. The company aims to stay true to its vision of being a place where high-quality work is produced and where people can do their best creative work, setting a unique path in the evolving landscape of media and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

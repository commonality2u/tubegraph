This philosophy helps in navigating the world effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This perspective is akin to playing board games, where some elements are within one's control, and others are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

It provides a "compass" for approaching one's work and life in the context of emerging technologies like [[application and implications of AI in the context of human intelligence | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

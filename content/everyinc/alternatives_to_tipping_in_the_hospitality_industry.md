The conventional practice of tipping in the United States has faced increasing scrutiny, leading to discussions and attempts at implementing alternative compensation models within the hospitality sector. Concerns range from inconsistent service quality to the perceived obligation of a "societal tax" rather than a reward for excellent service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Proposed Alternatives: Incorporating Wages into Menu Prices

One significant alternative proposed and attempted involves eliminating tips entirely and instead integrating service staff wages directly into the prices of menu items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### The Danny Meyer Model

Restaurateur Danny Meyer, through his Union Square Hospitality Group, which includes establishments like Shake Shack and other fine dining restaurants, made an effort to eliminate tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The aim was to adjust menu prices to ensure a living wage for staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

#### Challenges Faced by the No-Tipping Model
*   **Customer Perception of Higher Prices**: When a restaurant eliminates tipping and adjusts menu prices to cover staff wages, customers often perceive the menu as more expensive compared to establishments that maintain a tipping model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This can deter patrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Staff Earnings and Retention**: While a no-tipping model aims to provide a better base wage for all staff, top-performing waitstaff, who often earn significant income through tips, may find their overall earnings reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This can lead to the best employees seeking work elsewhere where they can earn more through traditional tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Union Square Hospitality Group reportedly had to halt their no-tipping policy due to these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## The Broader [[Debate on the necessity of tipping in America | Debate on the Necessity of Tipping]]

The conversation around tipping has intensified, marked by a growing [[controversy_and_backlash_around_tipping | backlash against tipping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. While some acknowledge the frustration with recent tipping changes, they also consider the perspective of staff who rely on tips for their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

The [[history_and_origin_of_tipping_practices | history and origin of tipping practices]] in America are complex, with roots in Europe before being brought to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Interestingly, European countries largely abandoned the practice, viewing it as aristocratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Tipping is not a universal practice, with different countries approaching it uniquely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Challenges of Transition

The [[economic_implications_of_tipping_vs_nontipping_models | economic implications of tipping vs nontipping models]] highlight that once a specific tipping regime is established (either tipping or non-tipping), it becomes very difficult to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Shifting from a tipping system to a non-tipping one, or vice-versa, presents significant hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

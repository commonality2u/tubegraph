Developing and selling tech startups is a complex journey, often characterized by ambition, technical acumen, market challenges, and significant personal growth. The experiences of Dan Shipper, co-founder of Every, and Brandon, Every's first entrepreneur-in-residence, highlight key aspects of this process, from early ideation to successful acquisition and subsequent ventures.

## Early Entrepreneurial Roots

Dan Shipper's journey into tech began in middle school after reading a Bill Gates biography, inspiring him to "be Bill Gates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. His initial ambition was to start a Microsoft competitor called "Megasoft," with a simple plan: "write soft," "burn it to CDs," and "distribute to mailboxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. This early aspiration led him to learn to code, realizing that building businesses with only his time as a cost was "the coolest thing ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

His first real software was "Find It," a Blackberry app that would make the phone ring even on silent mode if a specific email was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This rudimentary business, generating revenue from one-time purchases, paid for his gas and food in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

Brandon's early experiences were more hands-on, starting with dismantling objects and building with Legos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. In college, he joined the Solar Decathlon, teaching himself AutoCAD to design schematics for a solar-powered house that had to be transported by train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. Later, he renovated a school bus into a mobile entrepreneurship school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. His first "purely business" venture was Photon, a photo-printing app, born from a desire to easily print photos from phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. While not a commercial success, it provided valuable [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | learning experiences]] in shipping a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.

## Founding and Selling Firefly (Dan's First Acquisition)

In 2010, during college, Dan and his co-founders started Firefly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The initial idea for their B2B software came from Dan's father, who ran a cemetery and funeral home company and wanted a "Battleship-like" grid system to discuss architectural diagrams over the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Though Dan initially dismissed it as a "stupid idea," his co-founders built the first version at a hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. A company then expressed interest in using it for customer service, leading them to prioritize this over another product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

Firefly developed co-browsing technology, allowing agents to see and assist customers on a web page in real-time without downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This technology was "incredibly hard to build," especially ensuring cross-platform and cross-browser compatibility, even for older browsers like IE8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

Firefly operated with minimal external funding, raising only $20,000 from the Dorm Room Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. At 22, Dan was approached by a live chat company, and later by Pega, a public enterprise software company, leading to an acquisition auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. Pega acquired Firefly when Dan was 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. The acquisition process, especially for a young founder, was described as "wild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a> and "traumatic" due to intense diligence and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

## Founding and Selling Clyde (Brandon's Acquisition)

Brandon's second venture, Clyde, stemmed from a problem he identified while working at Knockout Concepts, a startup building a 3D scanner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. He realized that existing insurance offerings for high-value products were cumbersome and lacked technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. At 22, despite his inexperience, he decided to build an "Affirm version" for insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

Clyde's mission was to enable any business to launch their own extended warranty program, similar to AppleCare, but accessible and easy to implement like a Shopify app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>. They aimed to create a marketplace of insurers to quickly match policies to products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. A key early challenge was resisting exclusive deals with insurance companies, a decision crucial for building their marketplace vision, even if it jeopardized early traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

Clyde scaled, raising $3 million, then $14 million, and a Series B round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. However, the business faced significant challenges:
*   **Competition**: Which emerged soon after initial funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.
*   **Time to Value**: Big deals took a long time to launch due to client implementation requirements and internal bureaucracy at large retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.
*   **Lack of Focus**: Trying to serve all platforms (e.g., various ERPs, e-commerce platforms) instead of focusing on a niche like Shopify, diluted their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **Spending Money**: The availability of capital encouraged spending, but not always wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

After seven years, Brandon decided to sell Clyde, closing the deal with Cover Genius in March 2023, just weeks after the SVB shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. Selling the company was "a very hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a> and "emotional" experience, leading to feelings of both freedom and identity loss, a common [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | experience for exited founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.

## Key Learnings & Entrepreneurial Traits

Both founders highlighted crucial entrepreneurial traits and lessons learned from their experiences:
*   **Problem Identification**: Recognizing a personal "annoyance" as a market problem is a cultivated "muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.
*   **Iterative Approach**: Comfort with continuous iteration and not getting stuck on initial solutions is vital for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. This includes being open to critiques and constantly sketching new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **"Figure It Out" Mindset**: The ability to tackle unknown challenges with confidence, rather than being overwhelmed by a lack of instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Love of Building**: A fundamental enjoyment of creating things is a core part of being an entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic "No"**: The importance of saying no to potentially jeopardizing deals, even in early stages, to maintain a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>.
*   **[[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | Emotional Investment]]**: Building a company demands significant emotional investment, and saying goodbye to it can lead to anxiety and a temporary loss of identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>.

## Evolution to Every: A New Model for Tech and Content

After their respective acquisitions, both Dan and Brandon navigated periods of reflection. Dan spent four years "wandering the desert," writing a novel and angel investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. Brandon's post-Clyde journey involved moving to Nicaragua and experimenting with new ideas, quickly building and testing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

Every, originally "Superorganizers," started as Dan's attempt to interview interesting people about their productivity systems and then build a product for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>. It evolved into a media company and writer collective, aiming to bundle business newsletters and provide support to writers while offering readers access to multiple authors through a single subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.

However, the "writer collective" model faced challenges due to the rarity of individuals who are both knowledgeable business writers and consistent content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>. Unlike software, where founders can delegate product building, media requires the founders' continuous creative output to maintain product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:59">[01:41:59]</a>.

The company's direction shifted again with the viral success of Lex, an AI-powered word processor built by Dan's co-founder, Nathan, which was spun out into its own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>. This prompted Dan to focus on his core strength as a writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

Brandon joined Every as its first entrepreneur-in-residence, inspired by an article on the "billion-dollar solopreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>. He recognized Every's existing distribution as an "unlock" for building and getting feedback on products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. Together, they developed a "pyramid" business model for Every <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:52">[02:29:52]</a>:
*   **Base**: Free, high-quality writing and podcasts to attract a broad audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:31">[02:30:31]</a>.
*   **Middle**: Paid subscription offering bundled content, behind-the-scenes access, course discounts, and software like Lex, Spiral, and Sparkle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:42">[02:30:42]</a>.
*   **Top**: Higher-priced training, consulting, courses, speaking, and advising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:29">[02:31:29]</a>.

This model allows cash from the top of the pyramid to fund the creation of more free content and products, focusing on high-quality output and [[branding_and_identity_in_tech_companies | building calm businesses]] with minimal external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:51">[02:31:51]</a>.

### [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | Developing AI Tools]] at Every

Every's product studio builds [[evaluating_ai_technology_for_startup | AI-powered tools]] that address common problems.
*   **Spiral**: A prompt builder that automates creative work, like converting podcast transcripts into social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:06">[02:07:06]</a>. It leverages AI models like Claude to understand context and generate concise, compelling content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:29">[01:40:29]</a>. This tool emerged from Dan's need to automate repetitive, skilled tasks in his own workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:55">[01:40:55]</a>.
*   **Sparkle**: An AI file cleaner that organizes computer folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:31">[02:07:31]</a>. While powerful, its perceived invasiveness presents a [[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | user adoption challenge]], as users need to trust AI with their file organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:31">[01:50:31]</a>.

Both tools exemplify the concept of an "AI wrapper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a> – building specific functionality on top of general-purpose AI models like Claude, making AI more accessible and solving specific user pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>. The early adopters of these tools are often those who already use AI but seek more specialized and efficient solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

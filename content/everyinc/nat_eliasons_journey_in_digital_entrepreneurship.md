Nat Eliason has carved out a unique path in the digital space, characterized by his ability to identify emerging trends, dive deep, and achieve success before moving on to the next big thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:03">[02:12:03]</a>. His career has spanned SEO, crypto, authorship, and most recently, [[developing_ai_tools_for_entrepreneurship | AI-powered development and education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Early Success with Rome Research

Eliason's foray into online education began with Rome Research. In October or November 2019, he discovered Rome Research through a tweet from Adam Keasling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Impressed by the tool, he began tweeting about it, generating significant interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

> "I just said like hey does anybody want me to do a course on teaching how to use Rome and a lot of people on Twitter responded positively and I just put up a PayPal link and I think I got $10,000 or something worth of pre-orders off of those tweets before I'd written any Co or written anything for the course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>

The course eventually generated approximately $600,000 in sales over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. A key factor in its success was a partnership with the Rome team, who offered $100 in credit for their product to anyone who took Eliason's $100 course, effectively making the product free for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Strategic Exit from Rome Course Business
Eliason consciously decided to step away from the cohort model of the Rome course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This proved to be an "accidentally good decision" as Rome's development declined and competitors like Obsidian emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. He recognized the risk of building a large business apparatus around a course whose interest could eventually wane, leading to liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Diverse Ventures and [[personal_challenges_and_learning_in_startup_growth | Learning]]

Eliason has ventured into various other areas, demonstrating his diverse interests and an adaptable approach to [[founding_and_running_a_startup | entrepreneurship]].

*   **Real Estate (Airbnb)**: In June 2020, he invested profits from the Rome course into an Airbnb property near Austin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Despite a seemingly good deal at the "pit of the real estate market," the experience proved "miserable," involving incidents like a frat party, property damage, and a $15,000 repair bill due to a freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. They sold the property in May 2022, at the peak of the Austin market, yielding a 6X cash-on-cash return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.
*   **Cafe**: He opened a cafe in January 2020, which he admits was not ideal timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Crypto & Authorship**: His book, "Crypto Confidential," was released in mid-summer, during a period when crypto was not widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. The market picked up in the fall, aiding the book's reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

## Diving into AI and Cursor

Eliason's journey into AI began with early experimentation with GPT-3, attempting to build a "stoic bot" for therapy conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. While initially not successful, he revisited AI in late 2023, specifically focusing on AI-augmented software tools like Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

He first explored building a mobile app to track his writing, inspired by Strava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. He quickly got a basic version working, realizing the potential for using these tools to build software for his own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

A significant shift occurred with the emergence of "agents" in AI development tools around late 2024, including Replit, Bolt, Lovable, and Cursor's own agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. These agents allowed for extensive programming with minimal prior knowledge, enabling users to prompt the AI to build full applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

### Building AI-Powered Tools
After finishing a draft of his sci-fi novel, Eliason decided to explore how these new AI tools could assist his writing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

*   **AI Editing Tool ("Hubbard")**: He identified the inefficiencies of managing saved prompts and the limitations of context windows in existing AI chat interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Within a day, he built an app, "Hubbard," that allowed him to paste in an entire manuscript, select reader personas (e.g., "Master editor," "Angry adversary"), and receive detailed feedback instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. This tool also includes a task manager that integrates with editing prompts, ensuring the AI focuses on new feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>. It also features a character editor with a role-playing chat function to help flesh out character details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:00">[41:55:00]</a>.
*   **Podcast Automation Tool**: To streamline the production of his podcast "Between Drafts" with Nathan Barry, he built an app that takes an audio file and automatically generates descriptions, timestamps, and formatted show notes for various platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. This tool saves him several hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

## The New AI Course and Its Impact

The rapid success of these self-built tools led to public demand for a course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. Eliason, initially hesitant to teach another course, was swayed by over 100 positive responses to a tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

### Launch Success
He launched a pre-sale page that generated $200,000 in sales in just one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. This significantly surpassed his previous course's initial pre-sale performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

### Course Philosophy and Student Outcomes
Eliason's new course focuses on teaching people how to build their own applications with AI using tools like Cursor. A key aspect is the minimal need for troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. Out of 700 students, only two instances required his direct intervention for issues not solvable by Cursor itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. The course emphasizes letting Cursor handle problems and errors, even if he knows the solution, to demonstrate its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>.

The course demonstrates how to build a simple Pomodoro Timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a single prompt, which Cursor then autonomously generates, edits, and checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>. This process, which would have taken 20-30 minutes manually, is completed in 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.

> "What I think is so crazy about this is like we're just watching this happen right like literally two years ago to do this we would have had to type every single character into every single one of those files that is wild it feels like the dark ages to like hand type your code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>

Students are building diverse applications, such as a calculator for solopreneurs (Paul Millard) and a journaling tool that deletes text if the user stops writing (Cat Lavy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. This demonstrates how AI lowers the barrier to entry for building, shifting the focus from syntax to problem-solving and troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.

## Vision for the Future: The Hyper-Prolific Solo Creator

Eliason's ultimate goal is to cultivate a "hyper prolific solo Creator business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. He aims to predominantly write and discuss his interests while maintaining a robust business with minimal management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>. This vision is enabled by AI, which drastically reduces the need for hiring for tasks like podcast editing and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.

He foresees a future where AI acts as a collaborative assistant in writing, particularly in editing and providing feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[34:08:00]</a>. This could dramatically speed up the editing process, which is often a major bottleneck for authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>.

> "The writing that it generates is getting good it's getting better but it's still like not really your writing but the feedback it can give you as an editor is getting excellent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>

He believes that in the coming years, novelists will need to learn to use AI tools to remain competitive, either to improve work quality, increase production speed, or expand into other mediums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a>. The future of writing, for most, will involve AI assistants, much like how James Patterson uses ghostwriters trained on his style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:45:00">[50:45:00]</a>. This will allow writers to operate at their "top 1%" ability consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:45:00">[51:45:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_strategies_for_ai_startups | Challenges and Strategies for AI Startups]]
Eliason acknowledges the rapid pace of AI development, which quickly renders educational content outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:53:00">[55:53:00]</a>. His strategy is to offer courses opportunistically while they are relevant, knowing they have a limited shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:56:00">[57:56:00]</a>. This allows for agility without the burden of maintaining a large team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:15:00">[58:15:00]</a>.

His journey exemplifies how the rise of AI is shifting the landscape of [[entrepreneurship_and_authentic_expression_in_startup_culture | digital entrepreneurship]], enabling creators to build powerful tools and businesses with unprecedented efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:36:00">[57:36:00]</a>.

This article explores an investment analysis journey utilizing AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT, aiming to replicate a successful investment strategy, specifically focusing on the energy sector.

## The Investment Strategy: Replicating Nvidia's Success

The core objective was to find an investment as successful as a previous [[nvidias_success_and_identifying_similar_investment_opportunities | Nvidia]] purchase made in January 2019 at $33 a share, which later rose to $800 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This success was based on a specific investment thesis:
*   **Temporary Price Dip** The company's price was temporarily down due to an exogenous factor, like a trade war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Position of Power** The company held a strong market position due to proprietary technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Growth Potential** Its market position was expected to grow with increasing demand for its products (e.g., machine learning and gaming for GPUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

This strategy involved finding companies that had recently experienced a sudden downturn, suggesting a temporary distress situation that would provide a "margin of safety" for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Initial AI-Assisted Stock Screening

Using Gemini, a large language model with a one-million token context window, the process began by loading earnings call transcripts from 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The goal was to identify potential "10-bagger" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Initial screening criteria for companies included:
*   Market cap between a couple billion and $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Positive gross profit, indicating the company knows how to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   Six-month performance showing a downturn (e.g., down 20%) but a five-year performance at or above zero, suggesting temporary dysfunction amidst underlying strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Gemini's initial suggestions, based on a list of technology companies, included Bill Holdings, Clavio, and Appen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. However, the AI was hesitant to make specific investment decisions, often providing cautious caveats due to liability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. When prompted to "make a decision" by role-playing as Warren Buffett, Gemini suggested a value-oriented approach, looking for undervalued companies with low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios and strong fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

Applying a low P/E filter (below 15) and broadening the industry search, a new list of 29 companies was generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. When asked to cluster these by company nature and industry position, Gemini identified:
*   **Commodity-based businesses**: Companies like Archer Daniels Darling Ingredients and Civitas, influenced by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Consumer-facing businesses**: Companies like Davis Budget Group, GoGo, and Urban One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Technology-oriented businesses**: Companies like Perion Network and Universal Security Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
*   **Healthcare businesses**: Dita, CrossCountry Healthcare, and Amen Healthcare Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

The idea of investing in companies disliked by consumers, like GoGo (in-flight internet), was considered because despite poor service quality, they might have strong distribution lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. However, an external search revealed that GoGo's stock was down due to internal issuesâ€”delays in its 5G network launch caused by design errors from a subcontractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This internal problem did not fit the "exogenous shock" criterion.

### Exploring the Energy Sector

The search shifted to industries affected by exogenous factors. ChatGPT suggested that inflation data and the energy sector were experiencing downward pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. This led to a focus on energy, given the potential for technology shifts and government investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

The refined question for AI was: "What energy companies control a key bottleneck in the value chain and are positioned to ride a new technology wave over the next five years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

Gemini provided several categories and examples:
*   **Midstream Companies**: Control transportation and storage of oil and gas, investing in technologies like pipeline leak detection and carbon capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>. Examples: Kinder Morgan (KMI) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.
*   **Renewable Energy Developers**: Control development and construction of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>. Examples: NextEra Energy (NEE) and [[Analysis of TechnoIndustrial Companies | First Solar]] (FSLR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **Energy Storage Companies**: Critical bottleneck in the transition to renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. Examples: Tesla and Fluence Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.

ChatGPT's suggestions for energy included:
*   **Hydrogen Production and Fuel Cell Technology**: Plug Power Inc., Ballard Power Systems, Bloom Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   **Building Resilient Supply Chains**: Alcoa Corporation, Freeport-McMoRan Incorporation, Rio Tinto Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   **Green Business Opportunities**: Beyond Meat, Tesla, First Solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

Initial screening of these suggested companies in TradingView showed that Kinder Morgan and Enterprise Products Partners were not sufficiently "down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>. NextEra Energy was down 15% over six months but up 20% over five years, showing strength with temporary dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.

### Refining the Scalability Criterion

A crucial refinement to the investment thesis was the "extremely scalable business model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. This meant the company could grow "100x in a year and not run into any key bottleneck," similar to [[nvidias_success_and_identifying_similar_investment_opportunities | Nvidia]] (fabulous model, buying capacity) or Meta (advertising, low infrastructure cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.

When asked to identify energy companies with this high scalability, the AI models continued to suggest manufacturers like First Solar, Enphase Energy, and SolarEdge Technologies, and residential solar providers like Sunrun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. However, these still involved physical manufacturing or deployment, which lacks the extreme scalability of digital or fabless models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

### Challenges and Limitations of AI for Investment Analysis

Throughout the process, several limitations of AI models for investment analysis became apparent:
*   **Hesitation and Caution**: LLMs often avoid making direct recommendations due to liability concerns, tending to provide generic advice or multiple options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>.
*   **Lack of Real-time Data**: Gemini, in particular, did not have real-time data, making it difficult to assess current stock performance or specific exogenous shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. ChatGPT had more up-to-date information but still required specific prompting.
*   **Content Access**: The biggest challenge was obtaining enough relevant, current content (like detailed earnings transcripts or analyst reports) to feed into the large context window of models like Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>. Many online content sources are behind paywalls or designed to prevent easy scraping by LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>.

## The "YOLO Trade" and Final Investment

Given the difficulty in finding a perfect fit, a "YOLO (You Only Live Once) trade" was considered: [[Assessing SPAC companies and their potential as investments | SPAC companies]] that went public, got "wrecked" in the market, and were now small-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. Matterport and OpenDoor (OPEN) were considered, but OpenDoor's stock performance (down 73% over five years, but up 51% in the last year) did not clearly fit the immediate "exogenous shock" criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

23andMe (ME) was identified as a potential candidate, trading at $0.58 and valued at $270 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. It faced an exogenous shock (data breach, lawsuits, and potential delisting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. The speculative bet was on its genetic data becoming valuable with the advent of [[The impact of AI on business models and investment | Transformer models]] capable of processing it for predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. Despite high uncertainty and the risk of bankruptcy, a $1,000 investment was made in 23andMe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

### The Pivot to Google

Surprisingly, the 23andMe investment saw a quick profit (up 9% total) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>, leading to an exit of the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>. A new candidate emerged that more closely fit the refined thesis: Google (Alphabet).

Google's case for fitting the investment thesis:
*   **Exogenous Shock**: Recent negative perception and stock price dip due to issues with Gemini and higher-than-expected CapEx in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>. The stock lost $70 billion in value over a week due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:34">[01:30:34]</a>.
*   **Highly Scalable Business Model**: Google is cited as having "one of the most scalable business models ever conceived" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>.
*   **Key Bottleneck / Tailwind**: Despite increased compute costs for AI-powered search, Google is advantaged by designing its own semiconductors and having its own cloud infrastructure to deploy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>. This positions it to benefit from the [[The impact of AI on business models and investment | AI wave]] and LLM-generated search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:44">[01:33:44]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent**: Comparisons were drawn to Microsoft and Apple, which faced rocky periods but emerged stronger through subsequent technology waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>.

With these factors, the winnings from the 23andMe trade were rolled into a new investment in Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>.

## Reflections on the Process

The journey highlighted that even with a good investment strategy, opportunities that perfectly fit don't always exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>. The psychological pressure to "do something" can lead to poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>. A key attribute of a good investor is patience and the ability to "do nothing" while waiting for the right "fat pitches" â€“ obvious opportunities that clearly align with the thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. The investment in 23andMe was acknowledged as a "YOLO trade" and not a "Hall of Fame" investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

The experiment also revealed a potential future for LLM interaction: purchasing access to specific content (like books or financial data) for an LLM to analyze, creating a personalized, intelligent database for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>. Additionally, access to real-time data sources will be a significant advantage for AI-driven investment tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.

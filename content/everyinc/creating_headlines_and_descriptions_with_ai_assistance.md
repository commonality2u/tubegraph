Creative work often involves a "dirty little secret": a significant amount of drudgery beyond the core, enjoyable task of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This includes repurposing content for various channels, such as crafting headlines, X (formerly Twitter) posts, LinkedIn updates, YouTube descriptions, and Spotify listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. To address this, a tool called Spiral has been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Introducing Spiral: An AI Prompt Builder

Spiral is a powerful prompt builder designed to help users achieve an 80% head start on [[automating_repetitive_writing_with_ai | repetitive writing]], thinking, and decision-making tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Practical Applications of Spiral

### Generating Tweets from Podcast Transcripts

One key application for Spiral is converting podcast transcripts into tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Instead of spending an hour trying to brainstorm a tweet from a blank page, users can paste a podcast transcript into Spiral and press "run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For example, Spiral generated a tweet hook about Seth Stevens Devids writing a book in 30 days using ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This AI-generated tweet pulled out key details like the author's identity and interesting ideas from the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The speaker noted that Spiral actually wrote a tweet with the exact same hook that later went viral on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While some editing was still required, Spiral provided the foundational "bones" of the tweet, significantly reducing the overall time spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Crafting Headlines from Articles

Another common use case is transforming an article into a compelling headline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Finding the right headline can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Spiral can be trained on a user's top-performing headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

By pasting an article into Spiral and selecting "generate multiple," users receive several headline suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These suggestions are based on the article's content and what resonates with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

For instance, given an article, Spiral suggested headlines such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:
*   "The living map of language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   "How language models actually work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   "Demystifying language models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   "A map to meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   "Language models explained for humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

The last suggestion, "Language models explained for humans," was ultimately the headline used for the piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## How Spiral Works

Spiral's functionality is based on a structured process:

1.  **Define Conversion**: Users specify what they want to convert "from" and "into" (e.g., "podcast transcripts into tweets") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
2.  **Provide Examples**: Users give Spiral examples of previous successful outputs that embody the desired style and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. They also provide input/output pairs (e.g., a transcript and the corresponding ideal tweet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This allows the AI model to learn the nuances of transforming content into the desired format and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Extract Patterns**: The AI then writes a guide for itself based on these examples, detailing how to perform the conversion effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
4.  **Generate Form**: A reusable form is created that can be used by the individual or shared with a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This form can be made public, shared privately, or kept private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Users can also edit the full underlying prompt to customize it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Spiral is described as a simple yet powerful tool used extensively internally by content teams and writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

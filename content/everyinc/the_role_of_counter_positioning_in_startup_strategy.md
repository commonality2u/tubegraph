Counter positioning is identified as one of the most powerful ways a startup can gain an insight, not just about the product ("the what"), but critically about the method of delivery or business model ("the how") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy allows startups to [[Scaling a startup in a rapidly changing environment | wage asymmetric warfare on the present]] and introduce something radically different, avoiding the incumbent's established rules and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Business Model Innovation and Inflections

Historical "sea changes" in technology, such as mass computation (personal computers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> and mass connectivity (internet, iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, have shifted which business models are most attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Startups can exploit these shifts by adopting a business model that incumbents find difficult or disincentivizing to copy or retaliate against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

For instance, Google leveraged an advertising model that Microsoft, embedded in its software licensing model, could not easily counter or bundle into its operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This demonstrated that a different business model could render an incumbent's established advantages moot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### Incumbent Inertia

A key element of counter positioning is the difficulty for incumbents to change their ingrained business models. If a company charges subscriptions by the seat, this model is deeply embedded in its culture, from product managers to the CFO and even investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Changing it would lead to widespread disarray and resistance, making them slow or unable to react to a startup employing a different model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Examples of Counter Positioning

### Text IQ: From Cost-Plus to Outcome-Based Pricing
Text IQ disrupted the legal e-discovery market, traditionally dominated by "outsourcer firms" charging on a cost-plus basis for manual document review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Text IQ utilized AI to process documents for discovery with greater accuracy at a fraction of the cost, effectively becoming a substitute for labor spend rather than competing on software licenses or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This shift to [[Evaluating AI technology for startups | outcome-based pricing]] allows startups to compete on labor cost savings, which is unappealing for traditional SaaS vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

> "If I'm a SAS vendor and I charge subscription by the seat and that's all I've ever done think about how embedded that must be in the culture right every product manager thinks that way the CFO thinks that way there's nobody at the company who knows how to react to your strategy if you change your business model everyone's going to lose their mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

### Applied Intuition: Multi-Discipline Expertise Against General AI
Applied Intuition, a company creating simulation software for autonomous vehicles, exemplifies counter positioning against large AI firms like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. While OpenAI is transitioning from an API/developer tool to a product company with consumer-facing offerings like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, companies like Applied Intuition win by combining AI expertise with deep, multi-discipline knowledge of specific industry processes (e.g., car manufacturing, supply chains, testing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This strategy targets problems that a general AI provider like OpenAI cannot easily solve by simply releasing a new demo, as it requires intimate process knowledge that most people don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> "If the thing that you're wrapping on top of involves a process that you really know about that most people don't that may be a path to a great company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>

### Risk Profile and "Digital Darwinism"
Counter positioning can also arise from different risk appetites. Large companies like NASA or Google operate with high stakes and cannot afford visible failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. In contrast, startups like SpaceX (Elon Musk) or early Twitch (Justin.tv) can take higher risks, experiment, and learn from "failures" (e.g., rocket explosions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This allows them to move faster and try things that incumbents cannot, creating a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

This concept extends to a new mode of software development, termed "darwinian engineering" or "digital Darwinism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:30">[02:54:30]</a>. Instead of traditional waterfall or agile methods, AI-powered tools enable continuous adaptation, where software components are adaptive by design, sensing and responding to real-world inputs autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a>. This fundamentally different way of architecting products allows for emergent properties and dynamism within the ecosystem, creating new counter-positioning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>.

## OEM and Design Win Models

For [[Developing and selling tech startups | startups]] that integrate into other companies' products, a "design win" model can be a form of counter positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This works when the startup solves a problem that is:
1.  **Critical to the customer's product strategy**: The startup's offering becomes an integral "big square" in the customer's architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a>.
2.  **Something the customer has no interest or capability in solving themselves**: For example, Uber uses Twilio for messaging because they don't want their best developers building a texting platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Similarly, car companies partner with Applied Intuition because they cannot conceive of how to build a "software-defined car" with a fundamentally different architecture like Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This creates a "knife's edge" where the startup is critical but not a target for internal replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Conservation of Attractive Profits

Building on Clay Christensen's "conservation of attractive profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, new technologies can shift where profits are concentrated. In early markets, when products are "never quite good enough," vendors with integrated systems are rewarded for incrementally better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Tesla's integrated approach to building electric vehicles, controlling critical technologies, allowed them to achieve a "good enough" level of performance others couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

However, once performance becomes "mostly good enough" (overshot customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, profits can migrate to modular suppliers who offer components that can be mixed and matched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. The question for an [[Challenges and strategies for AI startups | AI startup]] is under what conditions it is advantageous to be a complete integrated solution (when customers are desperate for performance) versus a modular component (when core technology is commoditized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

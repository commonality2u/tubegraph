When confronting external circumstances, a key philosophical approach is to view them not as threats that diminish one's agency, but as opportunities to transform, extend, and enhance personal agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective contrasts with feeling disempowered, which can lead to self-sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### The Internal Experience of Agency

Agency is understood as an internal, "aesthetic experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Cultivating an awareness of this internal sense of agency is fundamental to navigating the world effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The speaker suggests that an early understanding of what is controllable versus uncontrollable, possibly through activities like playing board games, contributed to developing this internal compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### The Serenity Prayer as a Philosophical Framework

A foundational "old catechism" that guides this philosophical approach is: "the strength to change the things I can, the tolerance to live the things I can't, and the wisdom to know the difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This principle provides a framework for distinguishing between controllable and uncontrollable aspects of life and external situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Practical Application in Modern Contexts

This philosophical outlook can be applied practically, for instance, by product managers or designers facing technological shifts like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The challenge is to instantiate this "compass" into one's approach to life, offering [[practical_approaches_to_ai | concrete ways]] to orient oneself towards future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

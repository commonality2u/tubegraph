In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, understanding and evaluating new technologies is crucial for startups and investors alike. Rory Sutherland identifies three types of innovation: "Faster Horses," "Teleportation," and "Japanese Toilets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While "Faster Horses" aim to improve existing solutions and "Teleportation" represents visionary, perhaps impossible, breakthroughs, the most surprising innovations are often the "Japanese Toilets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. These are things users didn't know they needed until they experienced them, leading to a profound "why isn't this everywhere?" realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. For investors, the search is often for these "Japanese Toilets of AI" â€“ new experiences that surprise with their utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in the AI Age

A key aspect of evaluating AI technology stems from an investor's overall strategy. Rather than a "spray and pray" approach or seeking to own a proxy of the entire market, a concentrated investment strategy focuses on working closely with a small number of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This approach, reminiscent of older venture capital models, emphasizes deep engagement with founders, providing nuanced feedback rather than generic advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The goal is to be a close partner, understanding that every startup journey is unique and "the devils in the details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This strategy informs how new AI companies are evaluated:
*   **Founder Alignment:** Founders must understand the "product" they are buying from the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Transparency about the depth of engagement is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Risk Acceptance:** The venture capital industry has seen a trend towards mitigating risk through large funds and numerous investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. However, accepting inherent risk and focusing on deep work with good people is seen as a more authentic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   [[Venture capital decisionmaking and AI | Impact of AI on Venture Capital Decision-Making]]: The proliferation of massive funds influences how founders raise capital. It's important for founders to differentiate between transactional investments and those offering deep operational support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Identifying "Japanese Toilets" of AI

The "Japanese Toilet" innovation is characterized by being subtly executed, intuitive, and something users didn't know they needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Most of what gets funded in AI today falls into the "Faster Horses" category, often being B2B SaaS solutions that improve existing processes but may be arbitraged out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The focus should be on finding new experiences that surprise users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Case Study: Granola

Granola, an AI notetaker, exemplifies a "Japanese Toilet" innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Despite being the "50,000th AI notetaker," its unique approach made it stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Initial Misfire:** An earlier version of Granola was too interruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **The "Aha" Moment:** The current version of Granola, which operates more like Apple Notes, appending information to user-taken notes without distraction, immediately resonated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It's subtle yet profoundly useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

### Characteristics of Innovators

Founders who create "Japanese Toilets" possess distinct qualities:
*   **Sensitivity:** They are deeply attuned to user behavior and the subtle nuances of human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Chris, Granola's founder, noticed how an earlier "co-pilot" feature distracted users in meetings, leading to a shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **Insightful Product Decisions:** Their product choices stem from a deep understanding of customer needs, often unarticulated by users themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **"Propensity to Movement while Listening":** These founders move quickly but remain highly sensitive to feedback, iterating based on observed user behavior rather than just plowing through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This contrasts with those who are "all horsepower" and uncomfortable with ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, or "artists" who suffer from analysis paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Building and Scaling

AI is fundamentally changing how products are built, blurring traditional lines between roles and enabling unprecedented efficiency.
*   **Writing is Building:** With the ability to code in English, the distinction between a writer and a builder is fading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This means that writing can directly translate into building software, and software itself can become a form of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   [[Developing AI tools for entrepreneurship | Developing AI Tools for Entrepreneurship]]: AI tools allow for rapid prototyping and app creation. For example, a simple app to structure AI prompts could be built in 15 minutes using tools like Replit agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   **The "Agentic Spectrum":** AI coding agents can be evaluated based on how long they are allowed to work before asking for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
    *   **Short Leash:** Like Microsoft Co-pilot, completing single lines of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
    *   **Long Leash:** Like Devon, which can run for hours but might break more often if not perfectly guided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
    *   **Optimizing the Leash:** The optimal "leash" length depends on the problem, internal evaluation capabilities, and desired iteration speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Replit agents are noted for striking a good balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **Wordware and the "Blank Doc" Approach:** Wordware aims to open up the idea that everyone can be a maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Unlike chat-based coding tools, Wordware starts with a blank document, encouraging users to write down their desired features in plain English, akin to writing a long email to an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. This approach makes it easier for slightly technical users to build complex products, leveraging the intuitive nature of a blank page combined with AI assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   **Impact on Team Size:** AI allows smaller teams to achieve more. "One-pizza companies" (teams of around eight people) can now manage multiple products and media ventures at a high level, supported by generalists using powerful AI tools for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. This shifts the focus from "craft" (execution) to "art" (core decision-making), as AI automates much of the manual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   [[Using AI for business incubation | Using AI for Business Incubation]]: AI enables individuals to undertake personal "incubations" or side projects that would have been impossible before, such as developing a card game or opening a board game library, by automating tasks from legal document analysis to financial modeling and custom software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

## Trust and Evaluating AI Outputs

A significant challenge with AI is trusting its output, especially when working on tasks outside one's expertise.
*   **Model Selection:** Users often gravitate towards models they trust more for specific tasks. For example, Claude is preferred for language-based outputs where tone and style matter, while GPT-4 (referred to as "01") is used for objective logic and deeper reasoning, like checking statistical work or analyzing contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Prompting for Verification:** Instead of simply asking "Are you sure?", which can bias the model, strategies include:
    *   Asking for confidence intervals and pros/cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.
    *   Requesting the model to explain its logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
    *   Asking for multiple ways to solve a problem (e.g., "give me five options") to prevent the AI from running too far ahead with a single solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   **Context and Examples:** Providing more context and examples in prompts is generally more effective, as AI models are not just chat models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

## Beyond "Faster Horses": Higher Altitude AI Applications

The next frontier for AI applications lies in moving beyond simply automating existing tasks to enabling higher-level reasoning and decision-making.
*   **Codified Knowledge:** While coding models work well because of extensive documentation on best practices, many other fields lack such codified knowledge at a high "altitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
*   **User Control over Knowledge Navigation:** Instead of models directly providing solutions, there's an opportunity for AI to help users navigate different "decision theories" or methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. For example, an AI startup mentor that offers different decision-making frameworks (e.g., SWOT analysis) based on a user's problem, rather than just spitting out an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.
*   **Implicit to Explicit:** The goal is to make more of the implicit knowledge explicit, allowing users to explore the "terrain of possibilities" and then dive deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>. This contrasts with models that immediately "zoom in" to a specific answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

In essence, evaluating AI technology for startups involves looking for innovations that surprise and delight users, backing founders with deep sensitivity to user behavior, and exploring how AI can elevate decision-making beyond mere task execution.

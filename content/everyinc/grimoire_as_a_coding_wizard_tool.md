Grimoire is described as the number one programming GPT, a "wizard-based coding assistant" developed by Nick Dobos, a programmer with over a decade of professional experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. With over a million chats, Grimoire is recognized as a leading example of a successful custom GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Introduction to AI for Programming

Nick Dobos's journey into AI for programming began with his experience in iOS app development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He first encountered GitHub Copilot (based on [[features_of_codex_for_software_development | Codex]]) and was impressed by its ability to complete large sections of code from simple comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Following a layoff from Twitter, he had time to explore [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] when it launched in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The release of GPT-4 further highlighted its potential for programming, with Nick noting its ability to produce code at a "college level or higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

His approach to developing Grimoire was driven by a front-end and artistic perspective rather than a deep AI background, aiming to create something both useful and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Core Functionality: Prompt Programming

Grimoire is built on the concept of "prompt programming," which Dobos describes as a new branch of abstract programming, akin to a new form of programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This layer of abstraction sits above traditional programming languages like high-level languages, assembly, and binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It allows users to give prompts in natural language (e.g., English) and receive functional code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Key Features:

*   **Pre-built Projects and Templates:** Grimoire includes a variety of pre-defined project templates accessed via conversation starter buttons, such as a "Link in Bio" site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. These serve to solve the "blank canvas problem" for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Hotkeys:** A significant feature of Grimoire is its use of "hotkeys" â€“ single-character commands that trigger specific actions or functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
    *   **Netlify Integration (`n`):** One popular hotkey, `n`, instantly deploys generated code online via Netlify, allowing users to create and preview websites in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. These sites are typically ephemeral, deleting themselves after an hour, but can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
    *   **Code Zipping (`z`):** The `z` hotkey automatically zips up generated code files for download, simplifying the process of saving and using the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   **Interactive Experience:** Grimoire aims to be more than just a code generator; it provides an interactive experience, combining elements of an assistant, tutorial, and curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Grimoire as a Learning & Problem-Solving Tool

Grimoire is designed not only to generate code but also to educate users in programming. It contains an uploaded curriculum structured like a "Hogwarts-type way" with "chapters and parts," covering topics from basic "Hello World" examples to GitHub and command-line usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Dobos refers to this curriculum as a "horcrux" of his expert knowledge, essentially turning his programming expertise into a course for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The curriculum also delves into new creative tools like Midjourney and Runway, showcasing how LLMs can transform various media forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

A section called "Forbidden Spells" focuses on advanced development tools like Cursor, an AI-first branch of VS Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This section teaches users how to leverage Cursor's command K hotkey and combine multiple prompts for efficient coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Grimoire vs. Vanilla [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] for Programming

Grimoire differentiates itself from vanilla [[chatgpt_as_a_problemsolving_tool_for_coding | ChatGPT]] in several ways:
*   **System Prompt:** Grimoire's system prompt is engineered to make responses more truthful, helpful, and thoughtful, often involving explicit planning steps before generating code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   **Hotkeys:** The suite of hotkeys prevents repetitive typing and streamlines common programming tasks, such as generating and downloading code snippets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Steering and Focus:** The hotkeys and structured prompts help "reel the thought back in," keeping the AI focused and preventing it from veering into irrelevant or nonsensical responses, effectively reminding it to stay on a "sane path" for programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Planning Partner:** Grimoire serves as an effective planning partner, breaking down complex programming problems into practical, actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Custom GPTs and AI Tools

Dobos believes that custom GPTs, especially when integrated with tools like the code interpreter, are vastly underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. He highlights that the code interpreter unlocks "crazy amount of stuff" by allowing the generation and execution of scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

He emphasizes that this technology will:
*   **Lower the Barrier to Programming:** Making it significantly easier for non-programmers to create software, enabling new use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
*   **Transform Software Development:** Particularly for large teams, as demonstrated by Facebook's use of AI to generate test cases for millions of lines of code, with 70% of them going into production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   **Enable Large Action Models:** Building on the concept of Large Language Models, the future lies in "Large Action Models" that can interpret natural language commands and "rip through other systems" to perform actions like buying pizza, booking an Uber, or filling out spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Simplify App Usage:** AI can simplify complex applications by providing instant, precise tutorials, as demonstrated by using [[integrating_tools_like_chatgpt_in_writing_and_research_processes | ChatGPT]] to learn After Effects effects in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. This points to a future where AI operates as a layer driving other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

The development of Grimoire and other custom GPTs is largely an experimental process, involving constant iteration and testing to understand how to best "prod" and direct these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. This process involves understanding the "Zeitgeist of the world" to predict how models will behave and steer them towards desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

Dobos's work exemplifies the potential of AI to act as a "planning partner" and even to "parent" or nudge users towards desired actions, highlighting the proactive potential of future AI assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>. This is seen as making experiences previously accessible only to high-level executives (with personal assistants) more accessible to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.

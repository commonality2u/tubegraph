Lars Doucet, a game developer known for *Defender's Quest* [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:45]]], found his interest in Georgism significantly shaped by his experiences and observations within the world of online game development, particularly concerning virtual land and housing [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:04:25]]].

## The Phenomenon of Virtual Housing Crises

Doucet's path to Georgism was notably influenced by a recurring "weird phenomenon" he observed in online multiplayer games over three decades: the virtual housing crisis [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [00:04:33]]]. He described this as a "bizarre concept" where housing shortages and speculation, typically associated with the real world, manifest in digital environments [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [00:04:40]]].

### Early Observations: Ultima Online

His first encounter with this was around age 19 in the game *Ultima Online* [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:04:51]]]. In this game, players could acquire blueprints for houses relatively cheaply, but there was no land available to place them [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:05:03]]]-[[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:05:10]]]. At the time, Doucet assumed the server had simply filled up, feeling "screwed out of housing" because he hadn't joined the game early enough [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:05:15]]]-[[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:05:19]]].

Decades later, around 20-25 years after its launch, Doucet checked back and found that the housing crisis in *Ultima Online* was still ongoing and unresolved, complete with a black market for housing [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:05:23]]]-[[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:05:33]]].

### Recurring Patterns in Other Games

This pattern of virtual housing crises was not unique to *Ultima Online*. Doucet noted its repetition in other online games, such as *Final Fantasy XIV* [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:05:38]]].

### Modern Manifestations: Crypto Games and the Metaverse

The phenomenon became particularly prominent with the wave of crypto-based games in 2022, including titles like *Axie Infinity*, *Decentraland*, and *The Sandbox* [[speculation_and_investment_in_cryptocurrency_and_digital_assets | [00:05:44]]]-[[speculation_and_investment_in_cryptocurrency_and_digital_assets | [00:05:50]]]. Yuga Labs' *Otherdeed* land sales for the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem also exhibited these characteristics [[speculation_and_investment_in_cryptocurrency_and_digital_assets | [00:05:50]]]-[[speculation_and_investment_in_cryptocurrency_and_digital_assets | [00:05:55]]].

During this period, Doucet was working as an analyst for a video game consulting firm called Novik [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:05:55]]]. He predicted that these new virtual worlds would inevitably see virtual land speculation and reproduce the conditions of real-world housing crises, leading to disaster [[potential_risks_of_agi | [00:06:02]]]-[[potential_risks_of_agi | [00:06:12]]]. His predictions proved accurate [[potential_risks_of_agi | [00:06:19]]].

An anecdote highlighting this absurdity involved comedian Tim Dillon on Joe Rogan's podcast, discussing how becoming Snoop Dogg's virtual neighbor in *Decentraland* could cost millions of dollars [[speculation_and_investment_in_cryptocurrency_and_digital_assets | [00:06:46]]]-[[speculation_and_investment_in_cryptocurrency_and_digital_assets | [00:06:54]]].

## Connection to Georgist Principles

The ability to "reproduce the problems of the real world so articulately in the virtual world without anyone trying to do it" [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [00:06:24]]]-[[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [00:06:31]]]] was a key factor in Doucet becoming "George-pilled" [[economic_inequality_and_rent_seeking | [00:06:36]]]-[[economic_inequality_and_rent_seeking | [00:06:41]]]. He observed that these virtual crises arose from a class of people gatekeeping access to a scarce, necessary resource (virtual land) that others couldn't opt out of needing [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [00:04:03]]]. Those who "got there first" could charge rent without necessarily contributing further value [[economic_inequality_and_rent_seeking | [00:04:09]]]-[[economic_inequality_and_rent_seeking | [00:04:19]]]. This mirrored the Georgist critique of real-world land speculation and rent-seeking.

The fact that virtual housing crises could occur even in metaverses where land could theoretically be infinitely expanded [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:19:15]]]] further underscored the importance of location and network effects (what Georgists call "urban agglomeration effects" [[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | [00:19:22]]]), rather than just absolute scarcity.

## Policy Implications for Virtual Worlds

Doucet has extended his analysis to policy, writing a paper on how to apply the theories of land value tax (LVT) to virtual worlds [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [01:16:04]]]. He defines a "land-like asset" in these contexts as having three properties:
1.  It is scarce in supply.
2.  It is necessary for production (within the game's economy).
3.  It obtains locational value by virtue of its position in some kind of graph or network [[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | [01:16:27]]]-[[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | [01:16:40]]]].

He uses a fictional MMO example to illustrate:
*   A **unicorn** is scarce but not necessary for production; its value is aesthetic or preferential [[the_future_of_programming_and_ai_tools_like_github_copilot | [01:16:46]]].
*   A **permit to brew potions** is scarce and necessary for that activity, but permits are fungible and lack specific locational value [[the_future_of_programming_and_ai_tools_like_github_copilot | [01:16:56]]]-[[the_future_of_programming_and_ai_tools_like_github_copilot | [01:17:11]]].
*   A **plot of land** possesses all three characteristics, making it a prime candidate for speculation [[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | [01:17:11]]]-[[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | [01:17:16]]].

Domain names are cited as a close real-world digital analogy, with Vitalik Buterin having written about applying Georgist theory to them [[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | [01:17:16]]]-[[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | [01:17:20]]]. Doucet's policy paper focuses more on these literal simulacra of real-world land within virtual environments [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [01:18:26]]]-[[georgism_and_land_value_tax | [01:18:32]]].

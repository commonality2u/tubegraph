The landscape of [[venture_capital_and_startup_strategies | venture capital and startup strategies]] has been significantly shaped by recent economic shifts, market performance, and technological advancements like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Discussions highlight market conditions for exits, funding approaches for new ventures, and the evolving role of investors.

## Current Market Conditions

The Federal Reserve recently paused rate hikes, which would have been the 11th consecutive increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. However, two more 25-basis-point hikes are anticipated before the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. The market, particularly tech stocks, experienced a significant rally, driven by a "reversion to the mean" after a devastating 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. While the NASDAQ moved 30% to start the year, valuations for internet and software companies are still below their 10-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

Despite the rally, some stocks, particularly AI-related ones, are perceived as having "gotten ahead of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

## State of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)

Several companies, including Reddit and Stripe, are being floated as 2023 IPO candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. ARM confidentially filed for an IPO in April, seeking to raise $8-10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. This IPO is seen as a crucial [[liquidity_issues_in_venture_capital_industry | liquidity driver]] for SoftBank, which owns ARM and has experienced a "brutal run" with its Vision Fund taking a $32 billion write-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

For current IPOs, investors are demanding a "significant margin of safety" compared to deals done in 2020 and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Companies like ARM and Databricks, despite being "fantastic companies," must offer a "bigger discount" to get into the public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

ARM's valuation is a point of contention; while SoftBank acquired it for $32 billion in 2016 and an Nvidia acquisition fell through at $40 billion due to regulatory scrutiny, current estimates for its IPO valuation range up to $70 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Some argue ARM is a "mid-20s billion dollar company" now, based on its "Cash Cow business" and lack of significant product decisions beyond mobile processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

## AI's Influence on Valuations and Business Models

The recent market rally is partially attributed to enthusiasm for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>.
However, there is also a "radical realization" that businesses dependent on services replaceable by AI might not have long-term longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. The [[impact_on_venture_capital_and_investment | impact on venture capital and investment]] is visible, with significant demand for chips and infrastructure to build AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.

A high "discount rate" is applied to industries where AI's positive impact is further out (e.g., lawyers, investment banks), whereas industries like chip manufacturing see immediate valuation bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>.

## Venture Capital Funding and Strategies

### "Heat Check" Rounds and Capital Allocation
Recent funding rounds, such as Mistral AI's $105 million seed round at a $240 million valuation, are described as "heat checks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. These large early-stage investments are driven by the need to acquire expensive H100 and A100 GPUs for AI model training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

Critics argue that VCs are "subsidizing capex" by funding hardware purchases rather than groundbreaking IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a>. This is likened to the dot-com bubble where money was "flushed down the drain" on data center capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>.
![](!%5BObsidian-logo%5D(https://obsidian.md/images/logo.png))
> "When you put in a hundred million dollars into a startup to buy compute, you are not buying whiz-bang Next Generation IP, you are subsidizing capex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>

The cost curve for AI model training is rapidly decreasing, similar to DNA sequencing, with potential 100x cost reductions in 18-36 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:33">[01:38:33]</a>. This makes large investments in foundational models today a risky "lottery ticket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

### Optimal Fund Size and LP/GP Dynamics
The discussion touches on the "optimal Venture fund size" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. Large funds (over $1 billion) can participate in companies requiring more capital, but questions arise about the quality of investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:33">[01:41:33]</a>. Critics express concern that "too many things are getting funded," with a lower "margin of return" being required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>.

There is significant pressure on GPs from LPs for distributions, especially after market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>. This can lead to firms distributing shares too early, missing out on potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>. The lack of Public Market investing experience among many [[venture_capital_challenges_and_market_resets | venture capital challenges and market resets]] is noted as a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:27">[01:55:27]</a>.

### Calpers' Strategy
California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the largest public pension fund in the US, is increasing its venture capital allocation six-fold, from $800 million to $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:27">[01:57:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>. This comes after years of low exposure (1%) and "atrocious" returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:13">[01:56:13]</a>. While some view this as a smart move given that venture is "at the bottom or bottom third" of valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:40">[01:56:40]</a>, others question the "imbecilic risk management infrastructure" that led to such low historical allocation in Silicon Valley's backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:43">[01:59:43]</a>. The concern is that if the process isn't fixed, increased allocation could just lead to more losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:15">[02:00:15]</a>.

## The Importance of Writing Deal Memos

Writing clear, long-form deal memos (2-5 pages) rather than relying solely on "stupid performative decks" is emphasized for clarity of thought and attracting thoughtful critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. Decks are seen as dangerous for decision-making as they can "dupe somebody else" through graphics and lead to "group think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

## Creator Economy and Data Ownership

The Reddit API changes, which led to a widespread mod strike, highlight the tension between platforms seeking to monetize user-generated content and the communities that create the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Reddit's move to charge for API access, in part for AI model training, mirrored similar actions by Facebook and Twitter to control user experience and prevent third-party apps from "sucking users off the platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

The "value of Reddit is inherent in the community" and its content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. This event suggests a shift where "the value is going to go...more towards the individual people...and not to the centralized organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. A proposed solution for Reddit is to offer a "healthy rev share" or allow paid subscriptions to subreddits, splitting revenue with mods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

The broader shift towards users becoming "servers" of their own data, with individual IP addresses controlling access and being able to "rent" their data to services, could lead to hyper-fragmented, best-in-class interactions rather than a single aggregated service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:19">[01:39:19]</a>.

## Regulatory Impact on Investment and Innovation

The current regulatory environment in Washington D.C. makes it difficult for hyperscalers to acquire AI companies for over $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This "unintended consequence" means entrepreneurs and [[venture_capital_and_startup_strategies | venture capitalists]] building traction might not find an exit home like Instagram or WhatsApp did, potentially hindering innovation as many startups cannot become big, profitable businesses on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:34">[01:33:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

This situation creates a "two-sided problem": more capital is being spent to fund and start companies, while the traditional "downside protection" of acquisition has been undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>.

## The Role of Constraint in Startups

Over-funding can be a "huge distraction to Founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.
> "Constraint makes for great art, constraint makes for great startups. You need to have pressure on a startup for them to deliver. You cannot give startups five years of runway and expect it's going to work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>

The milestone-based funding system, where companies raise in stages (e.g., $10-25 million, then another $25-50 million after a year or two), is seen as ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. Excessive early funding can lead to high salaries and disincentivize efficient product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>.

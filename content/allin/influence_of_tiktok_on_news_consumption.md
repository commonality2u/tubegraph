The growing prominence of [[Impact and Future of TikTok in US | TikTok]] as a news source has raised concerns, particularly within the government, regarding its potential as an "attack vector" for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which controls the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.

Technological advancements, particularly in [[Artificial intelligence and its economic impact | AI]], are projected to significantly impact global economies and geopolitics, potentially leading to both productivity gains and disruptive societal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

## The [[AI War]]

The "[[AI War]]" is described as a conflict no country can afford to lose, as its outcome is considered "more important than profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. If either China or the US were to truly lose this war, it would have profound implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This struggle is viewed as integral to national success, surpassing traditional profit motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

## Economic Impact and Productivity

[[AI advancements and the economic impact | AI]] is expected to drive productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. However, there's significant disruption anticipated, with some entities becoming "disruptors" and others being "disrupted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. The impact will be felt by those implementing and changing as a result of AI, rather than just those producing the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

Historically, periods of great invention and productivity increases, like the 1920s, have coincided with big debt increases and widening wealth gaps, indicating that technological progress alone does not resolve these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

### [[AI and job displacement | AI and Job Displacement]]

A significant concern is the potential for [[AI and job displacement | AI]] to lead to substantial job losses, affecting millions in sectors like call centers and automotive lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. Such widespread unemployment could create a demand for public support programs, potentially fueling the rise of socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. The profit impact and financial benefits from AI-driven productivity are not expected to be immediate enough to address the existing supply-demand issues or budget deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications

The [[AI War]] has direct geopolitical implications, especially in the context of increased military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. The technology war is seen as directly linked to military power; losing the technology war means losing the military war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

### China's Role in [[AI Technology and Market Trends | AI Developments]]

China is noted to be somewhat behind in chip development but ahead in [[AI investment and technology | AI applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. Their strategy may involve embedding inexpensive chips into manufactured goods and leveraging robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. China's manufacturing prowess, accounting for 33% of all global manufactured goods (more than the combined US, German, and Japanese output), suggests a strong competitive drive where profit margins may be less of a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

### Investing in the Age of AI

In an era of [[AI as a computing platform and its potential disruption | AI-driven disruption]], investing in productivity-producing assets is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. However, caution is necessary, as "super scalers" like Nvidia carry risk issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. The focus should be on those implementing and changing as a result of AI, or creating impactful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

Attention must be paid to pricing, as even "great companies" become less attractive if their stock is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. The current environment, with high prices for "new hot things" like productivity growth drivers and a rising interest rate environment, is reminiscent of 1998-1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

Diversification is crucial due to widespread leverage and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. Uncorrelated assets, such as gold, can reduce overall portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. Productivity increases that translate to profits, possibly from capital gains, are also a factor, but the precise impact of [[AI developments and economic impact | AI]] on future revenues and efficiencies is hard to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

The discussion surrounding the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump highlights significant concerns about the nature of [[political_discourse_and_public_perception_in_america | political discourse]] and the potential for rhetoric to contribute to real-world violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Following the incident, commentators reflected on the events, the role of various actors, and the broader implications for the [[current_political_climate_and_the_impact_on_elections | political climate]] in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## The Assassination Attempt on Donald Trump
On July 13th, five days before the podcast recording, an assassination attempt occurred on former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>. A 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight rounds with an AR-15 at the former president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. One bullet nicked Trump's right ear, a detail confirmed by the president on Truth Social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Tragically, Trump supporter Corey Crispera was killed protecting his family, and two others were critically injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service's counter-sniper team 26 seconds after his first shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

Crooks had no criminal record and was not known to the FBI or Secret Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. He was a registered Republican but also donated $15 to a progressive PAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. His motive remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Leaks from a Senate briefing indicated Crooks wrote on a gaming platform, Steam, "July 13th will be my Premiere watch as it unfolds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. He possessed a second phone and a detonation device in his pocket, with an explosive device in his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

The Secret Service's timeline indicated Crooks was identified as a Person of Interest at 5:10 p.m., spotted with a rangefinder at 5:30 p.m., and on a roof at 5:52 p.m. by the Secret Service, yet Trump took the stage at 6:02 p.m., and shots were fired at 6:12 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Debating the Impact of Political Rhetoric

Following the assassination attempt, a significant part of the discussion centered on the role of political rhetoric.
One perspective suggested that leaders like Trump and Biden should issue a joint statement condemning violent language and disavow anyone on their teams who uses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The argument is that while passionate politics are acceptable, violent language can be interpreted differently by "sick people" or those who are mentally ill, potentially leading to tragic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Arguments Against "Both-Sides-ism"
Another view strongly refuted the idea of "both-sides-ing" the issue, asserting that years of Donald Trump's words have been "perverted and misconstrued" by mainstream media to vilify him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This perspective argues that the [[role_of_media_and_public_discourse_in_shaping_society | mainstream media]] has amplified violent rhetoric and associated it with tolerable reactions, leading to alarming sentiments where some hoped the shooter hadn't missed or justified violence against Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. It was noted that while Republicans might criticize Joe Biden's mental state, they are not calling for his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Specific examples of controversial rhetoric mentioned included:
*   An exchange between Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman at Allen & Company, where Hoffman reportedly said, "I wish I had turned him into an actual martyr" in response to Thiel's comment about funding "lawfare" turning Trump into a martyr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   A member of Jack Black's band allegedly stating it was "too bad the shot missed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[01:17:12]</a>.
*   Biden himself stating it was time to put Trump "in the bullseye" days before the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. While this was acknowledged to be rhetorical, the greater concern was the "level of demonization and vitriol" pursued by Democrats as a campaign strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   The repeated portrayal of Trump as "Hitler," a "fascist," or a "threat to democracy" was cited as taking demonization "up to 11," potentially poisoning the minds of mentally disturbed individuals who might then view assassinating such a figure as heroic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This was further emphasized by media covers depicting Trump merged with Adolf Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[01:20:16]</a>.

While acknowledging that "threat to democracy" can be a valid criticism, calling someone Hitler is deemed insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The general consensus was that "reasonable people can parse this and it is something that has occurred on both sides," and both parties could do better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[01:21:06]</a>. The need for debates of ideas in a healthy democracy, without censoring the marketplace of ideas, was also stressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[01:11:31]</a>.

## Secret Service Incompetence and Calls for Accountability
The incident also raised serious questions about the competence and accountability of the Secret Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[00:03:30]</a>. The fact that the closest rooftop (130 yards away) was not secured was widely mocked and questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[00:03:31]</a>. The Secret Service head claimed the roof was not secured due to its sloped surface, a statement deemed ridiculous as snipers were on a more sloped roof elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[00:03:38]</a>.

Key questions and alleged failures included:
*   Failure to cover the most obvious shooting spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[02:43:10]</a>.
*   A Person of Interest (Crooks) identified an hour before the shooting and spotted with a rangefinder, yet not intercepted, and the president allowed to take the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[02:53:50]</a>.
*   Lack of agents stationed at the fence, requiring an SUV to ram it for Secret Service access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[02:60:90]</a>.
*   Delay in getting Trump into the car and the convoy off to a hospital after he was shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[02:73:70]</a>.
*   Unreleased audio of Secret Service chatter from earpieces, which could provide crucial details about the chain of command and why Crooks was not intercepted earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[02:70:70]</a>.
*   The theory that snipers paused because they might have thought Crooks, despite not being in uniform, was a friendly, highlighting concerns about inter-agency communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:15:00">[03:21:50]</a>.

This incident is viewed as another example of institutions failing, akin to the Afghanistan withdrawal, where there is a lack of accountability, resignations, or firings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[03:35:10]</a>. It is argued that the Secret Service cannot investigate itself, especially given past incidents like the deletion of text messages from January 6th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[03:53:70]</a>. There was a call for the Secret Service Director to resign and for agents to testify on Capitol Hill without fear of reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[03:61:30]</a>.

## Conclusion
The assassination attempt on Donald Trump served as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the [[us_elections_and_political_dynamics | current political dynamics]] and the potential for extreme rhetoric to incite violence. The intense debate surrounding both the responsibility of [[role_of_specific_political_figures_and_strategies | political figures]] for their language and the competence of institutions like the Secret Service underscores a broader concern about public trust and the future of [[political_discourse_and_public_perception_in_america | political discourse]] in the United States.

The United States [[real_estate_market_and_the_impact_of_wework_bankruptcy | real estate industry]] is currently facing significant legal challenges due to class action lawsuits alleging artificially inflated commissions for home sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>.

## Major Verdict Against NAR

In October, a federal jury in Missouri found the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and several brokerages guilty of conspiring to artificially inflate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>. This verdict mandates them to pay at least $1.8 billion in damages to sellers of over 260,000 homes between 2015 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. This ruling could potentially bankrupt the NAR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.

Subsequent to this case, additional class action lawsuits have been filed, collectively amounting to potentially $13 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.

## The US Commission Structure

The traditional commission structure in the United States typically involves a 6% commission on home sales, split between the seller's agent and the buyer's agent, each receiving 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. This 6% is a tradition, not a legal rule, and can be negotiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a>.

This system means the seller pays the buyer's broker, even though the buyer generally doesn't sign a direct contract with their agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>. This creates a disincentive for buyer agents to look out for the buyer's best interest, as a higher sale price directly increases their commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. The argument is that if buyers had to directly pay their agent 3%, few would agree to such a high fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>.

The total volume of residential real estate commissions in the US is an estimated $100 billion per year, supporting 1.6 million licensed real estate agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. Commercial real estate transactions also follow a similar commission structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>.

## Challenges to the System

Companies like Redfin have attempted to change this system, but have faced resistance from brokers who would refuse to show homes with lower commission rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

The monopolistic aspect of the industry stems from the requirement to be a licensed broker and a member of the National Association of Realtors to list a property on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), which feeds data to popular platforms like Redfin and Zillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>. This ties up the market and makes it difficult to operate outside the NAR system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

The process of listing a home could be reduced to a fixed fee of a few thousand dollars, rather than a percentage of the home's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. This percentage-based model for agencies transacting volume doesn't make sense from a first principles perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.

Some individuals have found ways around this, by paying a flat fee to a licensed broker to list their home on MLS, effectively using a "for sale by owner" (FSBO) approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

## International Comparison

The US commission rates are significantly higher than in many other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>:
*   **United States:** ~5.5% (split between buyer's and seller's broker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>
*   **United Kingdom:** ~1.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>
*   **China:** ~2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>
*   **Russia:** ~3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>
*   **Germany:** ~4.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>
*   **France:** ~5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>
*   **Japan & Argentina:** Comparable to US at ~6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>

## The Role of MLS and Brokerage Control

The MLS acts as the de facto marketplace for homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>. Platforms like Zillow and Redfin obtain their data by sweeping the MLS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>. The core of the monopolistic issue is the brokers' control over this marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. Breaking this monopoly and fostering alternative listing services is key to competing away the high brokerage commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>.

The situation is analogous to the travel agent industry before the internet, where agents had proprietary access to ticketing systems like Saber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. Just as Expedia provided direct access to flight booking, sites like Zillow provided direct access to MLS listings, reducing the need for an intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. However, the main function of buyer brokers remains scheduling appointments, as direct tours are typically not allowed unless represented by an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.

## Future Impact and Industry Shift

The outcome of these lawsuits is expected to lead to a significant shift in the [[housing_affordability_and_market_dynamics | real estate market]], benefiting consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. It could result in a change where brokers offer forms allowing sellers to pick the commission percentages they want to pay to both their agent and the buyer's agent, or implement caps on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>. This could also lead to a shift from percentage-based commissions to a flat-rate fee, with a percentage only applied above a certain price point, to better align interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>.

However, such changes could have a negative economic impact on the large number of people who depend on brokerage fees for their livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>.

The topic of border control and [[Immigration policy and border security challenges | immigration policy]] has been a significant point of discussion, with various perspectives on its handling and impact.

## Biden-Harris Administration's Approach

Mark Cuban criticized the Biden administration's initial handling of the border as "horrific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. He acknowledged that the administration might have adopted their approach for humanitarian reasons, understanding that individuals fleeing Central American countries might seek asylum upon reaching American soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. However, he contended that this approach opened the door "too wide," leading to numerous cascading problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

In June 2024, President Biden signed an executive order, which is now permanent, that removed the option for individuals to simply set foot on American soil and automatically be eligible for an asylum hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. Additionally, Vice President Kamala Harris worked with the Mexican government, leading to steps that have reduced the flow of people to the border, resulting in current border encounter numbers similar to those during the Trump administration before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

Despite these changes, Cuban acknowledged the existing problem of a large number of non-citizens or "illegal aliens" in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. He views Harris's approach to deportations and the asylum system as more "common sense," suggesting she prioritizes the removal of criminals first, a stance echoed by figures like JD Vance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. There is also a bipartisan [[immigration_policy_and_border_security_challenges | immigration bill]] that aims to reduce the time for asylum adjudication to 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

## Contrasting with Trump's Stance

Donald Trump's stated policy is to deport all illegal immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. Cuban drew a comparison to former President Obama, who was labeled the "deporter-in-chief" for deporting over three million people through a specific and understandable process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>. However, concerns were raised that Trump's more aggressive approach could lead to social unrest, reminiscent of past incidents like the Elian Gonzalez case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

## Underlying Theories and Debates

During the discussion, several theories regarding [[Impact of immigration policies | immigration policies]] were explored:
*   **Political Motivation** One theory suggests that the opening of the border was intended to increase the number of Democratic voters, while another counters that new working-class immigrants might align with the populist Republican party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.
*   **Economic Impact** An economic theory posits that increasing the base of low-cost workers, especially during periods of low unemployment and high inflation, could have a deflationary and stimulatory effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Executive vs. Legislative Authority** Mark Cuban expressed a preference for Congress, rather than the executive branch, to determine [[US immigration policy and skilled workforce | immigration policy]] and who enters the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

Despite the administration's initial missteps, Cuban believes they have acknowledged their error and are now working towards rectifying the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

## Kamala Harris's Evolving Stance

Kamala Harris's past statements on border security have been brought into question. Prior to her vice presidency, she described Trump's border wall as "un-American and medieval" and mocked it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. She also previously compared ICE to the KKK and suggested abolishing it, stating that images of border patrol agents evoked slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. However, her current rhetoric indicates a tougher stance on the border, which some interpret as an "election year conversion" or a natural evolution of her views after learning more about the complexities of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

## Elon Musk's Views on Immigration

Elon Musk's stance on [[Immigration and its implications | immigration]] was theorized to be rooted in his identity as an immigrant. It is suggested that his opposition to [[Immigration policies and labor market dynamics in the US | illegal immigration]] stems from a belief that its presence and associated negative rhetoric can diminish the standing of legal immigrants, including himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>. By advocating for the removal of non-citizens, he might believe he is indirectly improving the perception and status of those who have legally immigrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:59">[01:53:59]</a>. This perspective offers an alternative explanation for his public statements on [[Trumps gold card and immigration policy | immigration policy]], suggesting a personal motivation beyond mere political alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>.

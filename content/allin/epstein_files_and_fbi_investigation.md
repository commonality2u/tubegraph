The podcast discussed a letter concerning the handling of [[Epstein files and FBI investigation | Jeffrey Epstein's]] investigation documents by the FBI. This letter, from Pam to Director Patel, highlighted a discrepancy in the number of documents provided versus what was known to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Document Withholding Allegations

A request for full and complete files related to [[Epstein files and FBI investigation | Jeffrey Epstein]] initially yielded approximately 200 pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. However, it was later discovered through a source that the FBI field office in New York possessed thousands of pages of documents concerning Epstein's investigation and indictment, which the FBI had not disclosed despite repeated requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Director Patel was reportedly surprised by this new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The letter stipulated that by 8:00 a.m. on February 28th, the FBI was to deliver the full and complete Epstein files without any withholding or limitations on access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Discussion on FBI Discretion

The hosts debated whether the FBI should have the discretion to withhold such information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. One perspective acknowledged that the FBI can withhold information, even from the President, if there's an ongoing investigation, or if sources would be jeopardized, or due to national security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The counter-argument was that this situation appeared to involve a lie of omission, rather than a negotiation about what to release to protect people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The underlying question for the hosts was whether a lower chain of command is allowed to withhold information from superiors based on their own judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The ongoing nature of this breaking news story was acknowledged, with more facts anticipated in the following days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The discussion also touched upon whether public interest in the files is driven by a desire for gossip, to prosecute those who harmed people, or to "cancel" individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. It was suggested that the situation might relate to a "deep state cover-up" conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

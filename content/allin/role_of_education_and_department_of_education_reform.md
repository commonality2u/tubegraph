Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate, holds strong views on the reform of the education system in the United States, particularly advocating for the abolition of the federal Department of Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

## Critique of the Department of Education
Ramaswamy asserts that the federal government is not directly involved in education, making the Department of Education a "deadweight waste" that inefficiently cycles money from taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. He argues that the department distorts educational choices by favoring four-year college degrees over options like vocational training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>. Furthermore, he claims the department uses funding as a "cudgel" to compel local schools to adopt "toxic racial and gender ideology-based agendas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

## Proposed Reforms
Vivek Ramaswamy's plan for education reform includes:
*   **Abolishing the Department of Education** He proposes to shut down the department, which he states spends approximately $80 billion in taxpayer money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.
*   **Returning Funds to States** The funds from the abolished department would be returned to states as a "Department of Education shutdown dividend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.
*   **School Choice Requirement** To receive these funds, states would be required to have a school choice program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.
*   **Reforming Teacher Unions** States receiving funds would also need to revise their teacher contracts to prevent teachers from joining unions, which Ramaswamy views as a "destructive force on our Public Schools" for "unionizing against the public" and "the very kids you're supposed to represent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.
*   **Transparency in the Classroom** He advocates for transparency, stating that "if you teach it in the classroom put it online" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
*   **Incentivizing Efficient Spending** Ramaswamy highlights a negative correlation between the amount of money spent per student and actual academic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. His proposed school choice model would allow parents to receive vouchers or educational savings accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. If a parent chooses a school that spends less per student but performs better, they would receive half of the financial difference, potentially amounting to a "quarter Million Dollar Plus graduation gift" upon a child's graduation from 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

## Connection to Broader Issues
Ramaswamy's views on education reform are part of his broader platform, which seeks to address what he perceives as a "deeper void of purpose and meaning" in the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. He believes that institutions, including schools, should help fill this void by focusing on foundational building blocks such as faith, patriotism, hard work, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. This perspective aligns with his critique of phenomena like "wokism," which he sees as symptoms of this underlying societal emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. He also touches on [[higher_education_system_critique_and_student_loan_issues]] and the [[end_of_racebased_admissions_and_its_implications]] in his broader political messaging.

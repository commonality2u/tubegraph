Regulatory capture, defined by 1982 Nobel Prize winner in economics George Stigler, describes a phenomenon where regulation, as a rule, is "acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:53">[08:42:53]</a>. This means that a special interest is prioritized over the general interest of the public, leading to a net loss for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:07">[09:27:07]</a>. Venture capitalist Bill Gurley asserts that "regulation is the friend of the incumbent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:58">[08:50:59]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Influence

Two primary mechanisms are typically used in [[regulatory_capture_and_influence_of_corporate_interests_in_government | regulatory capture]]: limited market entry and price protection or increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:08">[09:43:08]</a>. The mechanisms of influence that enable this include:
*   **Money**: Direct contributions, made worse by *Citizens United* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:05">[09:53:05]</a>. Gurley recounts an early experience where a congressman required $5,000 checks from 10-12 people, including spouses who didn't even need to attend the meeting, just provide the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **Exposure**: Time spent around key individuals in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>.
*   **Revolving Doors**: Individuals moving between industry and government positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:07">[10:00:07]</a>.

A 1999 Morgan Stanley research study concluded that landmark [[regulatory_changes_faced_by_spacex_and_other_industries | regulatory action]] tends to improve returns for the largest players in the targeted industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:04">[10:33:04]</a>. Many attempts to increase competition or improve customer experience through deregulation have failed, reinforcing Stigler's findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

## Case Studies of Regulatory Capture

### Telecommunications Industry
Bill Gurley's fourth venture capital investment was in Tropos Networks, a company developing industrial-grade mesh Wi-Fi that could "bathe a city in Wi-Fi Broadband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This technology excited hundreds of mayors across the country who wanted to provide free Wi-Fi service to their downtown areas for public safety, economic development, and to address the digital divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

However, these plans "collided with commercial interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Verizon successfully pushed a bill through the state legislature to thwart Philadelphia's wireless plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Comcast, headquartered in Philadelphia, also put a bill on Governor Ed Rendell's desk, drafted by lobbyists for telecommunications companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. David Cohen, Comcast's Chief Lobbyist, was described as "Philadelphia's most powerful unelected official" by *The Inquirer* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Gurley likens challenging Comcast and their lobbying power to "a second grader challenging Michael Jordan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

Within two years, AT&T joined this fight, leading to the outlawing of municipal broadband in over 22 states, taking power away from local decision-makers in the interest of commercial entities, not citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

The **Telecommunications Act of 1996** was heralded as the most important telecommunications reform in 62 years, with two goals: to promote competition and to encourage the rapid development of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. However, the market saw the opposite effect:
*   In 1996, the top four telecom players controlled 48% of the market; four to five years later, after the legislation, they controlled 85% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   Venture capital dollars invested in telecom equipment, which used to be 15% of VC activity, dropped below 1% within 10 years, and the market for innovation in telecom equipment essentially disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

### Healthcare: EHR Software
Epic Systems, a large private company in Wisconsin, is the largest player in Electronic Health Record (EHR) software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Its CEO, Judith Faulkner, was the only corporate representative on Obama's Health IT Council in 2009 and a major donor to Obama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

Tucked within Obama's American Recovery Act (stimulus package) was the HITECH Act, which created the ONC agency to oversee health information technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Under this act, doctors would receive $44,000 if they bought software, totaling $38 billion in payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. Additionally, doctors received an extra $17,000 to prove "meaningful use" of the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

The ONC decided the threshold of features required for software to comply with this mandate, which Gurley speculates was based on Epic's feature set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The Department of Justice then enforced this, resulting in record fines against Epic's lesser competitors for not having the mandated features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. This created a "brick wall" for startups that typically disrupt by offering simpler products with key features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. Obama later called this the "most disappointing part of Obamacare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>. Gurley rates this a "10" in the "Olympic regulatory capture competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests
The COVID-19 rapid antigen test is based on lateral flow assay technology developed 80 years ago in 1943, making it a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.

*   **Europe**: Germany evaluated 122 vendors and validated 96, leading to five tests costing 3.75 Euros, or 75 Euro cents per test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>. The UK distributed tests to homes, having acquired them cheaply in large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.
*   **United States**: The US fought the adoption of rapid tests, partly because hospitals profited greatly from PCR tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. The New York Times listed only three available vendors, including Abbott <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Timothy Stenzel, who worked for the FDA overseeing antigen test approvals, previously spent four years at Abbott <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. When President Biden authorized $2 billion to purchase tests, they were bought from these approved vendors, including Abbott's overpriced and over-engineered test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. As of yesterday, tests at Walgreens and CVS were all exactly $23.99, while in the UK, they were about $1.50-$1.60 per test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. This 6x price differential prevented citizens from benefiting from cheap, commodity tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.

### Banking Industry
The number of new banks in the U.S. significantly decreased after 2009, notably due to the Dodd-Frank Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. This demonstrates the [[influence_of_regulatory_changes_on_ipos_and_mergers | repercussions of regulatory policies on venture capital and market growth]] and market entry.

## Broader Implications

### Impact on Innovation and Competitiveness
Gurley argues that [[regulatory_capture_and_influence_of_corporate_interests_in_government | regulatory capture]] gives capitalism a bad name, particularly where capture is highest, leading to price increases in sectors like healthcare and education, unlike the decreasing prices in competitive tech products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. He fears that regulation acts as a blocker to innovation, which in turn kills prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>.

### AI Regulation Debate
Concerns are rising about the [[impact_of_ai_regulation_on_innovation_and_global_competitiveness | impact of AI regulation on innovation and global competitiveness]]. Incumbent AI companies are actively meeting with government officials and spreading negative messages about open-source AI, perceiving it as their biggest threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, testified proposing a new regulatory agency similar to the Atomic Energy Commission, with standards for AI software release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>. This approach, according to Gurley, could turn software into the next "Big Pharma" or "military industrial complex," with Washington running the software industry and stifling startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>. This echoes the EHR example where the government mandated software features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>.

## Potential Solutions

Bill Gurley believes that the U.S. is "not very good at regulation" as most case studies show failures and a net loss for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>. He advocates for:
*   **Massive Transparency**: Mandating and increasing the transparency of financial contributions to politicians, similar to Open Secrets, to expose obfuscation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Revolving Doors**: The "rotating door" phenomenon, where individuals move between government and lucrative private sector roles, is a "massive problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>.
*   **"First Do No Harm" Principle**: Drawing from Senator Patrick Monahan's view, Gurley suggests Congress adopt a Hippocratic Oath-like principle to prevent unintended negative consequences of legislation, citing the example of mental health institution closures in the 1960s and their link to the homeless situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.
*   **Awareness**: Increasing public awareness about how [[regulatory_capture_and_influence_of_corporate_interests_in_government | regulatory capture]] operates and how legislators operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:18:00">[29:18:00]</a>.

Gurley notes that the U.S. federal government is now the largest consumer and distributor of capital in human history, fearing that this concentration of power, combined with [[regulatory_and_risk_management_concerns | regulatory capture]], contributes to national decline and could cause democracy and capitalism to "kill each other over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. He believes Silicon Valley's success is partly due to its distance from Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>.

Megan Kelly's experience illustrates the impact of cancel culture on media professionals, particularly her transition from traditional network broadcasting to independent media.

## Personal Experience with Cancel Culture

Megan Kelly's show on NBC was canceled, leading to her departure from the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She describes her previous industry environment as "incredibly disgusting and toxic and awful," where the goal was often to "stimulate outrage" and "get rich off of it," while pushing "somebody else's agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Kelly stated that she was "so much happier" after leaving and becoming an independent broadcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. She feels it was "just a matter of time before I was cancelled" at a major network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Redefining Cancel Culture

Kelly's perspective on cancel culture evolved significantly after her own experience. She now believes in cancel culture as a force that "separates individuals from companies where they do not belong where the values are not aligned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. She cannot imagine working at NBC, Fox News, or frankly any traditional network in the current environment, given the need to "comport with their rules on how we talk about these very dicey issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Advantages of Independent Broadcasting

As an independent broadcaster, Kelly gained the freedom to address topics without external editorial constraints. This freedom aligns with her core principles, particularly [[social_issues_and_their_impact_on_society_including_trans_rights_and_media_portrayal_of_police | free speech]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a> and defending issues she is passionate about, such as the portrayal of police officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. She emphasizes the ability to "just say what's true about the news" without having to conform to network agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Kelly's independent show, produced with six producers, has achieved significant success, outperforming major news channels like CBS and NBC on YouTube, and approaching the audience numbers of CNN's YouTube channel, despite CNN having around 100 staffers for a show like Anderson Cooper's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This success demonstrates the potential for independent voices to thrive outside traditional media structures.

## Broader Implications

Kelly's experience highlights a broader shift in [[role_of_media_and_public_discourse_in_shaping_society | media and public discourse]]. She notes a trend where traditional media outlets often push specific agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a> and engage in practices like condemning individuals without due process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. This environment has led to a growing demand for independent voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Her success on platforms like YouTube and Rumble exemplifies the rise of [[impact_of_alternative_media_on_elections | alternative media]] as a counter to traditional outlets.

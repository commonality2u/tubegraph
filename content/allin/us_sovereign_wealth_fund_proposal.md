The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to establish the first [[Sovereign Wealth Fund and Economic Initiatives | Sovereign Wealth Fund]] for the United States. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a> This initiative is part of broader discussions on [[US fiscal policy and debt challenges | US fiscal policy and debt challenges]] and [[Chinese investment strategies | industrial policy]].

## What is a Sovereign Wealth Fund?
A [[Sovereign Wealth Fund and Economic Initiatives | Sovereign Wealth Fund]] (SWF) is an investment fund owned by a state. They are almost universally anchored by natural resources, such as oil or minerals. Countries like Norway, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Australia all possess such funds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a> The United States is not typically known for having the oil reserves or mineral wealth common to these nations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>

## The Proposal
The proposed US [[Sovereign Wealth Fund and Economic Initiatives | Sovereign Wealth Fund]] would potentially be anchored by a 50% share of TikTok's US operations, which former President Trump stated he wanted to obtain by granting a license. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a> The concept of such a license is currently undefined and has not existed previously. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>

The Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary have been tasked with developing a comprehensive plan within 90 days. This plan is expected to include recommendations for:
*   Funding mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>
*   Investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>
*   Fund structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>
*   A governance model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>

## Rationale and Support
Chamath Palihapitiya suggests that if assets are "minted" (e.g., TikTok shares, potentially worth $100-150 billion), they should be managed effectively rather than solely focusing on debt reduction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a> He proposes a governance model involving five unpaid, sophisticated "Elder Statesmen" (such as David Tepper, Stan Druckenmiller, Ken Griffin, John Doerr, Mike Moritz, or Bill Gross) who are "mega-billionaires." These individuals would rotate in and out, deploying capital into American companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>

Antonio Gracias, CEO of Valor Equity Partners, supports the idea for a different reason: the lack of an [[Chinese investment strategies | industrial policy]] in America. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a> He highlights that competitors like China have long-term [[Chinese investment strategies | industrial policies]] backed by significant capital, which enables them to build capabilities like chip fabs domestically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a> Gracias views a [[Sovereign Wealth Fund and Economic Initiatives | sovereign wealth fund]] as a "stealthy way to create [[Chinese investment strategies | industrial policy]]" in the US, allowing private sector experts to make economically sound yet strategically beneficial investments for the country. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a> This contrasts with current approaches like the CHIPS Act, where government bureaucrats decide how to spend billions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>

Scott Bessent's "333 plan" aligns with this, aiming for 3% GDP growth, deficits no greater than 3% of GDP, and 3 million barrels of oil produced domestically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a> Palihapitiya notes that the US has energy reserves three times greater than Saudi Arabia across all forms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a> An energy-focused [[Chinese investment strategies | industrial policy]] could generate enormous revenue for the federal government, which could then be banked into a [[Sovereign Wealth Fund and Economic Initiatives | sovereign wealth fund]] as a "rainy day fund." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>

## Concerns and Criticisms
David Friedberg expresses concern that such a fund could make the government "too big" and lead to it competing with private investment firms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a> He notes that the government is generally "bad at capitalism" and, given the current $40 trillion federal debt with a 5% cost of capital on 10 to 30-year debt, it is difficult to achieve real risk-adjusted returns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>

Friedberg suggests that the mandate of the SWF should not be to simply invest capital and try to make money, but rather to be a "strategic vehicle for monetization of high-value government assets." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a> For example, if the US acquires a 50% equity position in TikTok, it should be managed by a capitalist manager who decides when and how to monetize the asset and return cash to the Treasury to pay down debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a> Similarly, government-seized assets like Bitcoin should be managed by experts to ensure optimal monetization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>

There's also an opportunity to manage Social Security funds more intelligently, as the program is projected to face bankruptcy in eight years. Instead of owning low-yielding bonds, the Social Security trust could have its capital managed by the SWF to invest in equities for better long-term returns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>

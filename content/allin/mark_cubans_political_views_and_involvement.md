He identifies as an independent, asserting he is "through and through" neither a Democrat nor a Republican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Political History and Voting Record

Cuban's voting history reflects his independent stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
*   He has voted Republican before, specifically for George W. Bush twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   He also voted for Barack Obama twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Cuban helped Perot's systems get into local and wide area networking, having previously met Ross Perot Sr. through his first company, Micro Solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Cuban states his "heart is libertarian," but he believes libertarians are "ideologues" rather than "problem solvers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He also expresses a general dislike for traditional politicians and the current state of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## Views on Donald Trump

Cuban has a complex history with Donald Trump, shifting from initial acquaintance to public criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
*   **Early Interactions**:
    *   Met Trump at a Super Bowl party at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, shortly after Broadcast.com's sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Visited Trump's office in Trump Towers in early 2000, noting that every inch was covered with pictures of Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Cuban resolved not to become so self-absorbed if he achieved similar visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   Trump sent him a letter criticizing his show, *The Benefactor*, after its cancellation in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   They reconnected around 2007 through Trump's son, Eric, collaborating on MMA broadcast deals for Cuban's HDNet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Trump praised Cuban at the time, stating "everything Mark Cuban touches turns to gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **2016 Campaign and Presidency**:
    *   Initially supported Trump's 2016 run, viewing him as a positive non-politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
    *   Had frequent phone conversations with Trump during the campaign, where Cuban pressed him on policy details, but found Trump wouldn't engage deeply or "learn these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
    *   Began public criticism on CNN, stating Trump wasn't making an effort to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
    *   After Trump's election, Cuban sent a congratulatory message and offered help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
    *   Provided ideas on healthcare reform (his "10 plan") and assisted with PPE issues during the pandemic, working with Jared Kushner and Peter Navarro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
    *   Recalls a White House visit where Trump preferred to discuss Boeing savings rather than healthcare policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Post-Presidency Assessment**:
    *   **Negatives**:
        *   The "vibe of the country was really, really, really bad" due to the "hate that he conveyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
        *   "Mean tweets" created uncertainty for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
        *   Handled the 2020 BLM protests and riots poorly, citing Trump's "when the looting starts the shooting starts" remark and higher riot-related deaths during his term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
        *   Accuses Trump of hypocrisy regarding being "anti-war," citing his decision to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia despite a bipartisan resolution to stop, which fueled the Yemen war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
        *   Presents a theory that Trump contributed to inflation by orchestrating an OPEC+ production cut in 2020 to benefit oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. He connects this to the 2019 Yemen war, where Saudi Arabia "owed Trump a favor" for selling them weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
        *   Believes Trump exhibits cognitive decline, similar to what was attributed to Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.
    *   **Positives**:
        *   Tax cuts, particularly lowering the corporate rate from 35% to 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.
        *   Operation Warp Speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
        *   Praises Trump as one of the "greatest salespeople ever" and a "motivator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. He refers to him as "Roy Cohn Jr." in his political tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.
    *   **Overall**: States he "just don't think he's the best person to be president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

    *   Acknowledges Biden eventually signed an executive order to limit asylum claims at the border, and Harris has worked with the Mexican government to reduce flow, bringing border encounters back to Trump-era levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
    *   Believes Harris has a "more common sense approach to dealing with deportations" and improving the asylum system, citing her support for a bipartisan immigration bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
    *   Defends Harris's past rhetoric and policy shifts (e.g., on the border wall) as "people change their mind for whatever reason" and "people learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

    *   Thinks Harris understands the importance of technology for efficiency and economic growth, even if not a "geek" herself, and is surrounded by experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
    *   Acknowledges the national debt is a problem and that Harris's team understands the need for efficiency and inflation control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

## Views on [[elon_musks_views_on_free_speech_and_digital_town_squares | Elon Musk]]

Cuban expresses admiration for [[elon_musks_views_on_free_speech_and_digital_town_squares | Elon Musk]] as an entrepreneur, calling him "the best of the best" and "insane" in his accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>. He particularly respects Musk's "all in" mentality, putting "every cent he has" into his ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:11">[02:00:11]</a>.

However, Cuban views Musk as a "troll" on Twitter (now X) and enjoys trolling him back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:07">[01:52:07]</a>. He disagrees with the idea that Musk bought Twitter purely for "free speech," suggesting it was more about connecting with conservative users who are "more joiners and heavier social media users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Cuban points out that advertisers avoid X due to its "free speech" stance allowing controversial content and explicit material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:19">[01:56:19]</a>. He believes Musk "didn't realize just how deep users will go in order to use their free speech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:50">[01:56:50]</a>.

## Future Political Aspirations

Cuban firmly states he will not run for president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>. His family, including his wife and kids, are opposed to the idea due to the impact on their normal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>. He believes that traditional political parties "don't exist anymore" as ideological entities, serving primarily as "fundraising vehicles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>.

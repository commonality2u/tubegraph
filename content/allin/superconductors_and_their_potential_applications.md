Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity with absolutely no resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This means electrons flow through them perfectly without bumping into atoms or generating heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. This unique property leads to no loss of power in the transmission of electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.

## Historical Discovery and Development
The concept of superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 when Mercury was cooled to a very low temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. In 1987, physicist Chu developed one of the first ceramic superconductors, demonstrating a new way of achieving superconductivity at hotter temperatures, specifically at the temperature of liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. This was a significant step as liquid nitrogen is relatively cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

## Key Properties Beyond Zero Resistance
In addition to zero electrical resistance, superconductors exhibit another interesting effect: magnetic fields reflect off the metal perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. This means a magnet placed on top of a superconductor will float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.

## Potential Applications of Superconductors

If room-temperature superconductivity can be achieved, the potential applications are vast and transformative:

*   **Efficient Energy Transmission**
    Currently, about 15% of power is lost in transmission from the power station to homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. Superconductors could eliminate this loss entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.

*   **Frictionless Transportation**
    Superconductors could enable maglev trains or other frictionless transportation systems that float above a superconducting track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>. With no friction, such trains could move without needing continuous energy input after an initial push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

*   **Powerful Microprocessors**
    A superconductor microprocessor could use just one percent of the energy of a traditional semiconductor microprocessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. This would drastically reduce energy needs for [[ai_advancements_and_the_development_of_supercomputers | AI chips]] and other computing applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.

*   **Infinite Battery Storage**
    Superconductors could be coiled to create batteries where electricity flows infinitely without turning into heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. The energy loss in such a battery would be less than five percent, and it would not require the [[dependence_on_critical_materials_and_rare_earths | materials]] currently used for chemical batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.

*   **Medical Imaging (Current Use)**
    Today, MRI machines utilize superconductors to reflect magnetic fields, keeping cool using liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.

## Challenges to Widespread Adoption
For most of the transformative applications, materials need to superconduct at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. While some materials have shown superconductivity at high temperatures, they often require extremely high pressure, making them not industrially feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Scientists have tried various materials including metals, carbon nanotubes, fullerene tubes, and tens of thousands of ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

## Recent Controversies: Ranga Diaz's Claims
Ranga Diaz published a paper claiming to have achieved superconductivity at room temperature and at only one gigapascal of pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. This sparked significant interest, as it would be a major step towards industrial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>. However, Diaz is a controversial figure, as a previous claim he made in 2020 was retracted by *Nature* journal after other scientists could not replicate his results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The controversy stemmed from his data analysis methods, which some believed skewed the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. His claims are currently undergoing scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Enabling Technologies
The scientific community is divided on the feasibility of room-temperature superconductors in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>. However, the advancement of [[googles_quantum_chip | Quantum Computing]] could play a significant role in accelerating discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. Current understanding of superconductivity is limited, with only one theory (BCS theory on Cooper pairing in Ceramics) explaining its mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>. [[googles_quantum_chip | Quantum Computing]] could help model molecular-level phenomena and simulate new crystal structures and molecules, potentially leading to the discovery of super-conductive materials that would take too long to test experimentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

The realization of room-temperature superconductivity could lead to "two or three order of magnitude improvements in the efficiency of certain systems of industry on Earth today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>. This includes reducing energy costs by 99% and increasing computing power a hundredfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.

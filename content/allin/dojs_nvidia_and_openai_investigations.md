The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have reportedly struck a deal to investigate AI incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This move is seen in the broader context of federal regulation concerning [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

## Allocation of Oversight

The agreement outlines specific areas of focus for each agency:
*   **DOJ's Role:** The DOJ is tasked with investigating whether [[NVIDIAs Consumer AI Initiatives | Nvidia]] has violated antitrust laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Potential areas of inquiry include [[NVIDIAs Consumer AI Initiatives | Nvidia's]] use of CUDA software to lock customers into its GPUs or how it distributes GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. At the time of this discussion, [[NVIDIAs Consumer AI Initiatives | Nvidia]] had briefly surpassed Apple as one of the largest market cap companies in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **FTC's Role:** The FTC will lead investigations into [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI's]] conduct and [[Microsofts investment in OpenAI and generative AI technologies | Microsoft's]] AI-related deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### FTC Probe into Microsoft's Inflection AI Deal

The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC has already opened a probe into [[Microsofts investment in OpenAI and generative AI technologies | Microsoft's]] deal with Inflection AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This deal involved [[Microsofts investment in OpenAI and generative AI technologies | Microsoft]] acquiring Inflection AI's staff (an "Aqua hire") and a significant "Commerce deal" to assist investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The deal, which included a $650 million licensing fee, was structured by [[Microsofts investment in OpenAI and generative AI technologies | Microsoft]] in a way that aimed to avoid regulatory scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The concept of a "shadow Aqua hire" was previously discussed on the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

## Expert Opinions on the Investigations

### Premature and Innovation-Hostile

Critics argue that these investigations are premature for a nascent industry like [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. The market is only 18 months to two years old, with limited end-user use cases and a vast imbalance between collective spending ($750 billion to $1 trillion) and generated revenue (less than $10 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The idea of launching an antitrust investigation before the market has even seen a full boom-and-bust cycle is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

> "I think the DOJ and the FTC are totally way out of their ski tips on this... I don't see what they're exactly investigating in an immature market where we haven't yet seen one cycle of boom and bust." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>

The administration's approach is viewed as part of an "innovation-hostile agenda," encompassing attacks on crypto and restrictive M&A policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. This contrasts with the government's historical role as a critical supporter of private industry in bleeding-edge fields like space, defense, and the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### Clever Deal-Making and Regulatory Gaps

While the investigations might be premature, there's acknowledgment of "clever forms of deal-making" by hyperscalers that circumvent traditional business constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. These include complex "Tac 2.0" or credit-oriented deals, such as financing companies to buy their own chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This sophistication has evolved from past regulatory challenges faced by companies like AOL (revenue round-tripping) and [[Microsofts investment in OpenAI and generative AI technologies | Microsoft]] (DOJ inquiry during Steve Ballmer's tenure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

! warning | Regulatory Blind Spot
The real inquiry should potentially come from the SEC regarding whether these are "real revenue" deals, rather than antitrust investigations into future competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

### Legislative Challenges

California's Governor Newsom has warned against over-regulating [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]], recognizing the potential for stifling the burgeoning sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The rapidly changing nature of [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] models (e.g., significant reductions in model size improving performance) makes it difficult for current statutes, which often define regulation based on model size, to remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Laws written based on expert opinions can quickly become outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

The current administration's stance on [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] regulation, along with its approaches to crypto and M&A, is seen by some as potentially hindering innovation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. The prevailing sentiment among the hosts is that policies should foster acceleration and progress rather than imposing unnecessary regulations that risk stifling emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

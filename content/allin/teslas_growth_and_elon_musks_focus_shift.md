Tesla recently experienced an 8% stock increase following its earnings report, bringing its five-day gain to 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. This rally is attributed in part to [[Elon Musks companies and roles | Elon Musk's]] indication that he would shift his focus back to Tesla after dedicating significant time to [[Impact of Twitter acquisition by Elon Musk | Doge]] (Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

## Elon Musk's Management Strategy
[[Elon Musks companies and roles | Elon Musk]] manages his multiple companies by engaging in "intense bursts" of focus on one specific business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. During these periods, he immerses himself in the company, learning its operations down to the database level, as observed during his initial three months at [[Impact of Twitter acquisition by Elon Musk | Twitter HQ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. Once he develops a comprehensive understanding and puts trusted individuals in place, he can transition to a more "maintenance mode," managing the company for a few days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>. This approach allows him to divide his time effectively across his five companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

## Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Robo-taxis
Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature was highlighted for its significant improvement, reportedly reaching a 99.5% reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Despite its effectiveness, users are required to hold the steering wheel and maintain visual focus due to a camera monitoring system that penalizes disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.

A debate exists regarding Tesla's camera-only approach for FSD versus the use of lidar technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. While some online discussions suggest that a lack of lidar could lead to more disengagements, particularly in conditions like direct sunlight affecting cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>, [[Elon Musks companies and roles | Elon Musk]] has consistently rejected the use of lidar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. In contrast, Google's Waymo, which uses lidar, employs fully autonomous units with on-board models that make decisions independently, only syncing with the fleet upon return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

Confidence was expressed in Tesla's ability to introduce functional robo-taxis within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

## Challenges and External Pressures
Despite the positive financial performance and technological advancements, Tesla has faced external challenges, including instances of "crazy leftists engaging in terrorism," such as firebombing Tesla dealerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. This external opposition contributes to the pressure on Tesla's operations and stock performance.

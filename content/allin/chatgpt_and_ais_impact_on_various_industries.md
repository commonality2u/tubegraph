Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered a new era of development with platforms like OpenAI's GPT models, particularly the conversational interface ChatGPT. These advancements are poised to [[impact_of_chatgpt_and_ai_on_various_industries | significantly impact numerous industries]] and professional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

## OpenAI's ChatGPT: Capabilities and Underlying Technology
ChatGPT is a chat interface built upon OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. This model produces "stunning" results, generating human-like text in various styles and formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. The GPT-3.5 model was trained in three steps: data collection, a supervised learning phase involving human tagging, and a human-ranking system for output optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>. The software package for this model is relatively small, approximately 100 gigabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.

While impressive, current AI models like ChatGPT are considered "brittle," excelling at specific tasks and simple questions (95-99% accuracy) but struggling with the "exceptionally hard" 1-2% of use cases requiring precise, guaranteed correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>. This final percentage of accuracy can take decades to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.

## Impact Across Various Fields
The capabilities of AI models suggest a profound [[impact_of_ai_on_different_industries_and_technical_fields | impact on different industries and technical fields]]:

*   **Knowledge Work Automation**
    *   Many human knowledge worker roles and functions could be replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.
    *   This includes tasks like homework assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.
    *   Software engineers could see their code optimized or even written by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>.
    *   Customer support roles are particularly vulnerable, as the cost of human labor could approach zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a>.
    *   Service industries like real estate and insurance sales could also see AI-powered software interfaces replace human roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.
    *   Writers and copywriters might use AI to generate numerous versions of commercials or advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

*   **Disruption of Existing Business Models**
    *   The search engine industry, especially Google's core search business, faces potential disruption by natural language chat interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>. Unlike traditional search results that provide links, AI can construct detailed, multi-paragraph answers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. This shifts the focus from indexing and linking to direct information provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.
    *   The Software as a Service (SaaS) model is expected to be replaced by "Models as a Service" (MaaS), where single-use AI models provide specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.

*   **Creative Arts and Journalism**
    *   AI is impacting creative arts and journalism, with models capable of generating scripts or even complex arguments that mimic human conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>. This includes movie and music production, and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">[01:33:56]</a>.
    *   The rise of [[impact_of_chatgpt_and_ai_on_various_industries | independent journalists]] and creators leveraging platforms like Substack, podcasts, and Twitter reflects a shift in media consumption, as consumers seek out unbiased sources and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:01">[01:49:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

## Economic and Societal Implications
The emergence of powerful AI capabilities is creating a new "hype cycle" and likely a "bubble cycle" in Silicon Valley, as investors flock to generative AI businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. This marks a significant moment, comparable to the advent of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>.

The ultimate value in AI lies in finding proprietary data sources for training models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:14">[01:35:14]</a>. Industries that can vertically integrate to gain exclusive access to large, unique datasets, such as healthcare with patient data or technology companies with device-collected data, will have a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>. This shift makes "data the new oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a>.

Investors and entrepreneurs are advised to carefully select markets where AI's "last mile" does not depend on undefined regulatory pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. For instance, medical diagnostics using AI has an established FDA approval process, unlike the less defined regulatory landscape for Level 5 autonomous driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:19">[01:38:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>. This highlights the importance of considering regulatory readiness for [[regulating_ai_and_its_implications | AI and its implications]].

Recent discussions highlight significant inefficiencies and alleged political motivations behind large-scale government spending on infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. The podcast hosts point to two major examples: a problematic course management portal and the stalled rural broadband and EV charging initiatives.

## Cases of Inefficiency and Waste

### NYC Course Management Portal
A course management portal for New York City was built for a cost of $600 million, with an additional $400 million requested for customization, potentially bringing the total to $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. Despite the massive investment, the resulting product is described as "garbage," resembling a SharePoint site that could have been created for 1% of the cost using more modern platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. This expenditure is cited as an example of egregious [[government_spending_and_budget_issues | government waste]] and inefficiency, with suspicions of regulatory capture and long-standing relationships leading to such inflated contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

### Rural Broadband and EV Charging Initiatives
Two programs from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed in 2021 are brought into question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>:
*   **Rural Broadband:** $42 billion was allocated to provide high-speed internet to rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. After 1,000 days since the bill's passage, zero people have been connected, according to FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
*   **EV Chargers:** $7.5 billion was designated to build 500,000 EV chargers over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. As of May, only eight chargers had been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

Private industry has already demonstrated solutions for both issues, with Starlink being deployed on commercial airlines for internet access and the private sector building over a thousand charging stations in the second half of 2023 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

## Reasons for Failure and Lack of Progress

The issues with these projects are attributed to a combination of factors:
*   **Government Waste, Fraud, and Abuse** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>: Critics argue that a fraction of the allocated money could have provided superior services through private solutions like Starlink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Incompetence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>: The government is seen as grossly incompetent and inefficient in program execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Political Retaliation and Partisanship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>: The FCC reportedly cancelled an $885 million contract with Starlink by falsely claiming it was incapable of providing high-speed internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Later, the FCC claimed Starlink provided so much high-speed internet that the term "monopoly" should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. This is seen as a "pure naked retaliation" by the Biden-Harris Administration against Elon Musk, similar to excluding him from an EV summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. This political motivation is costing taxpayers immense amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Desensitization to Waste** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>: There's a concern that the sheer scale of government spending has desensitized the public to what constitutes a large amount of waste, with $50 billion being an enormous sum that goes largely unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of Accountability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>: The media's tribalism prevents coverage of such issues, especially if it means acknowledging the success of individuals or companies disliked by a particular political alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. This leads to a lack of accountability within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Perverse Incentives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>: In government, cutting wasteful programs can upset constituents or remove opportunities to "buy votes" by directing funds to donors and favored vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the private sector where saving money is rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Dysfunctional Political System** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>: The political landscape has devolved into "warring political tribes" whose objective is to punish opponents and loot public coffers rather than focusing on the best policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

## Calls for Change

The discussion concludes with a call for greater transparency and accountability in [[government_spending_and_regulatory_reform | government spending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. It's suggested that the public needs to decide that such wasteful spending must stop to avoid bankrupting the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>. There's a plea to celebrate individuals and organizations that save money and promote efficient solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. The podcast hosts propose using their platform to highlight instances of [[government_efficiency_and_regulations | government waste]], urging listeners to share information on such scandals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

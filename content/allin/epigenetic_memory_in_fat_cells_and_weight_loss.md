Recent research published in the journal Nature by a Swiss team explores the epigenetics of fat cells, offering insights into why individuals who have been overweight often struggle to maintain weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.

## Understanding the Epigenome
Every cell in the body contains all of an individual's DNA and genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. Specific genes are turned on or off, or up-regulated and down-regulated, in different cells, which determines their function and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. This means genes in various cells can be overexpressed or underexpressed, leading to the production of specific proteins that perform particular functions within that cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

## Research Findings
The study investigated whether the epigenome of fat cells changes when an individual loses weight after being obese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

### Human Study
Researchers observed five individuals who were obese and subsequently lost more than 25% of their BMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. After weight loss, their fat cells still exhibited upregulated markers associated with poor metabolism, increased fibrosis, and increased cellular death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. These findings indicate the presence of inflammatory genes and genes linked to inefficient glucose utilization for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Essentially, even after weight loss, these fat cells continued to behave like "slow dying cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.

### Mouse Study
Similar results were found in mice, where fat cells retained an epigenetic memory, acting as if the mouse was still obese even after weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>. This meant their metabolism remained reduced, fibrosis stayed elevated, and the likelihood of cell death was increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. When glucose was applied to these cells in a Petri dish, it was not utilized as effectively as by healthy fat cells that had never been obese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

The study concludes that obesity permanently alters fat cells, creating an "epigenetic memory" that could explain why it is difficult for individuals to keep weight off after losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.

## Implications for Weight Loss and Future Opportunities
This epigenetic memory also sheds light on observations with medications like OIC, Wegovy, and Mounjaro (which are [[glp1_drugs_and_health_benefits | GLP1 Agonist drugs]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>. It's been well-documented that people tend to regain weight rapidly once they stop taking these medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

The findings introduce new opportunities for medical advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. Molecules that can turn specific genes on or off could be identified and used to alter this epigenetic memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. For example, significant cardiovascular exercise is known to express certain genes that trigger other genes to switch on or off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>. By identifying these molecules, future solutions could include supplements, additional drugs, or combination therapies that not only facilitate weight loss but also help sustain it by modifying the epigenetic memory in fat cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.

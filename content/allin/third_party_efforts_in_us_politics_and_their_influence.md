Discussions around the viability and impact of third-party efforts in [[us_elections_and_political_dynamics | US elections and political dynamics]] have gained traction, particularly in light of perceived dissatisfaction with the dominant two-party system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. Political analysts and commentators have debated whether the current [[current_political_climate_and_the_impact_on_elections | political climate]] could pave the way for a significant third-party breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.

## Historical Context
Historically, third-party candidates have struggled to gain widespread support. Ross Perot, for instance, managed to secure 19% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. Some believe that Perot's campaign presented a missed opportunity to establish a lasting third-party presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Viability

### Dissatisfaction with Mainstream Candidates
A significant portion of the American populace expresses discontent with the options presented by the major parties. For example, polls in early 2024 indicated that 86% of Americans across both parties believed President Biden was too old to be president, and 59% felt both Biden and Trump were too old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>. This widespread voter sentiment suggests an opening for alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

The reluctance of a candidate like Biden to undergo a basic cognitive test, which is seen as a tell that he might fail, further fuels public concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. This, combined with controlled public appearances, can lead voters to question the transparency and legitimacy of the leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>.

### The Role of Insiders and the Electoral System
Critics argue that the current electoral system, particularly the caucus system, allows party insiders to decide who the nominee is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. These insiders are perceived as benefiting from maintaining the status quo, which can lead to a sense of corruption and undemocratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. If citizens lose faith in democracy, it could result in calls for a third party or more extreme actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>.

### Potential for a "Breakout Season"
Given the current [[political_dynamics_in_the_us_elections | political dynamics]], some believe that the 2024 election could be a "breakout season" for a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

#### RFK's Candidacy
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK) is seen as a [[role_of_specific_political_figures_and_strategies | specific political figure]] whose candidacy could potentially lay the groundwork for a new third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>. If RFK can secure 30% or more support in some states, it could lead to a powerful outcome with "huge longitudinal benefits to America" by establishing a new political infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. His campaign's success in getting on presidential ballots in 50 states is considered a critical step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.

#### No Labels
"No Labels" is another organization making efforts to create a third-party option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. There's a "very reasonable chance" (estimated 30-50%) that this third party could be created after the presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>. The organization has engaged with potential supporters, suggesting interest in their concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:53">[01:29:53]</a>.

## Obstacles and Challenges

Despite the potential opening, significant challenges remain for third-party efforts:
*   **Late Timing:** The 2024 election is considered too late for new candidates not already in the race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Resistance:** Incumbent candidates like President Biden have stated their intention to be the nominee, and there's no clear mechanism to remove a candidate who has won necessary primary votes against their will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>.
*   **Party Loyalty:** The prevailing two-party system often means voters align with their party regardless of individual candidate issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.
*   **Media and Debate Access:** Refusal by major candidates to debate or subject themselves to rigorous interviews can hinder the public's ability to fully assess them, further entrenching the two-party narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
*   **Staff Interests:** The staff of a sitting president may have a vested interest in maintaining a "weak president who is borderline incapacitated" as it grants them more administrative power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>.

Ultimately, the power lies with the voters to take action and resolve to a solution if they are fed up with the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.

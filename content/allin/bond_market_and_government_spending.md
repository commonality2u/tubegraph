The bond market reacted to new [[government_spending_and_budget_issues | government spending]] legislation, leading to concerns about the [[us_national_debt_and_fiscal_policy | national debt]] and its potential economic consequences.

## Bond Market Reactions
The bond market experienced "chaos" following weak demand for newly issued 20-year bonds, pushing yields higher across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The 10-year Treasury yield, a benchmark for borrowing costs like mortgages, spiked to a five-handle at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This immediately impacted the stock market, with the S&P dropping 1.5% in 30 minutes and all three major indices down between 1.5% and 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### How Government Funding Works
The federal government funds its operations by issuing Treasury bonds, which are sold to individuals, companies, banks, and foreign governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. When demand for these bonds is weak, the government must increase the interest rate it pays on them to attract buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The recent weak demand for a modest $16 billion bond auction was seen as a significant negative signal by financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## The "Big Beautiful Bill" (BBB)
The House passed the "Big Beautiful Bill" at the 11th hour, which makes the TCJA tax cuts permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. While estimated to increase long-run GDP by 60 basis points if all cuts are implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, it is also projected to reduce tax revenue by $4 trillion and add between $3 trillion and $5 trillion to the [[us_national_debt_and_fiscal_policy | national debt]] over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Concerns and Consequences
The bill is seen by some as "anti-Doge," going against the desire for meaningful [[government_spending_and_regulatory_reform | government reform]] and [[economic_policy_and_managing_us_debt | austerity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates often assume interest rates of 3.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. However, 30-year Treasury interest rates are currently over 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For every incremental 1% above 3.6%, the government spends an additional $350 billion per year in interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This means a 1.5% increase could add another $5 trillion to interest payments over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

[!WARNING|Recursive Debt Spiral]
Increased interest rates lead to higher interest payments, forcing the government to issue more debt, which can further drive up interest rates. This is described as a "nonlinear relationship" that can quickly get out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The market's reluctance to buy government debt due to high deficits could lead to climbing rates, creating a massive problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Projected consequences include:
*   **Rising Interest Rates:** The 10-year Treasury could pass 5% and the 30-year could reach 6.25% or 6.5% by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Deleveraging from US Debt:** Investors may sell US debt and instead own assets like gold and Bitcoin, which have recently spiked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Credit Downgrades:** Ratings organizations may downgrade the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Inflationary Pressures:** The bill contains inflationary aspects, potentially prompting the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Impact on Average Americans:** Higher rates will make it harder for people to buy homes and could lead to increased energy and Medicare prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Political Landscape
Some argue that the House was supposed to implement [[economic_policy_and_managing_us_debt | austerity measures]] and pass a "recision bill" to cut spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Instead, they passed a bill that adds $4 trillion to the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. There is a perceived lack of financial literacy in the House regarding the long-term impacts of such legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Republicans are divided on spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. While the bill permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts, which prevents a "massive tax increase" for the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, it falls short on spending cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Some argue that making the tax cuts permanent is crucial for Republican prospects and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

[!NOTE|Political Dynamics]
The bill passed with a one-vote margin, highlighting the difficulty of achieving significant spending cuts when Democrats want more spending and many Republicans are "soft on spending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. True [[economic_policy_and_managing_us_debt | austerity]] would require both parties to agree on painful changes, which is currently not happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

## Global Context: Japan and the Yen Carry Trade
The situation in Japan is seen as a cautionary tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Japanese bond yields have soared, and a recent 20-year Japanese bond auction had the worst demand since 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. This indicates a massive selloff in credit and a potential unwinding of the "yen carry trade," where investors leveraged Japanese bonds against US Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

Japan owns $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. If this trade unwinds, it would mean net sellers of over a trillion dollars of US Treasuries, further exacerbating the market's reluctance to own US debt, leading to even higher yields and interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. The only way to keep rates low would be for the Federal Reserve to buy these bonds, which would devalue the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## Path Forward
Some hope that the Senate will make "technical maneuvering" changes to the bill to make it better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Ultimately, the bond market will likely "sensitize this budget at real rates" (i.e., current market rates, not CBO's assumed 3.6%), leading to a "very different risk exposure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

[!INFO|Can We Grow Our Way Out?]
One perspective is that technological advancements, particularly in AI and robotics, could lead to such massive economic growth and deflation that the current [[us_national_debt_and_fiscal_policy | fiscal problem]] becomes manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. This would be an alternative to implementing politically unpopular [[economic_policy_and_managing_us_debt | austerity measures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>.

However, this growth hinges on abundant energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>. While the US currently has 1 terawatt of continuous power production capacity and aims for 2 terawatts in 15 years, China is already at 3 terawatts and scaling to 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>. The bottleneck is the lack of manufacturing for essential energy components like natural gas turbines, which are primarily produced in China, leading to long waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. Scaling energy production is seen as "this generation's Manhattan and Apollo project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:14">[01:30:14]</a>.

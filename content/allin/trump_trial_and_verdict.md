From: [[allin]] <br/> 

A significant verdict was announced in the [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] trial in New York City, finding [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] guilty on all 34 felony charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The sentencing is scheduled for July 11th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## The Trial and Charges
The New York hush money trial lasted six weeks and included testimony from 20 witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. The jury deliberated for about a day and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. A key moment in the trial involved [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]]'s CFO, who outlined the terms of payments made to Michael Cohen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

The case centered on falsifying business records, which is considered a serious crime in New York City, the financial capital of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>. New York also takes election interference very seriously, with a history of cases against minor infractions like ballot stuffing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. According to one panelist, the legal theory for the felony conviction involved falsifying business records as part of a "second crime" related to election interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>. The jury's unanimous decision was based on the belief that these actions were taken to save [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]]'s election chances following the Access Hollywood tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. Witnesses, including Michael Cohen, Allan Weiselberg, and the National Enquirer's Pecker, reportedly testified that the payments were made out of fear it would reduce his chances of being elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>.

### Grounds for Appeal
Several grounds for appeal were highlighted:
*   The judge is a Biden donor with a daughter working for Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.
*   Prejudicial and irrelevant evidence, such as Stormy Daniel's testimony, was admitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.
*   [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] was unable to call his election law expert, former FEC head Bradley Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>.
*   The prosecution never explicitly named the "second crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>.
*   The judge allowed the jury to choose from a range of options for the "second crime," including tax crimes with no presented evidence and federal election crimes outside the court's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a>.

It is speculated that the case will likely be tossed on appeal, but probably after the November 5th election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>.

## Panel Reactions and Implications
Panelists offered varied perspectives on the verdict:

### David Sacks's View
Sacks characterized the case as a "novel, creative, and torturous" legal formula that would not have been brought against anyone other than [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>. He asserted that both Merrick Garland's DOJ and former Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance had previously passed on bringing this case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. Sacks claimed that Alvin Bragg, a Soros-funded DA, won his election by pledging to get [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>. He believes the entire point of the case was to be able to label [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Donald Trump]] a "convicted felon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. Sacks views the case as a "sham" and an "outrage," asserting that politically motivated cases against a former president and current frontrunner should be for something more substantial than "ticky tacky" issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.

### Chamath Palihapitiya's View
Chamath suggested that the verdict solidified existing opinions: those who hated [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] found their hatred confirmed, while those undecided or pro-[[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] found more reasons to support him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>. He noted the widespread confusion among legal scholars and experts, regardless of their political alignment, about the nature of the trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. Chamath concluded that this moment reveals the fragility of U.S. government systems, where institutions might be convoluted and used by those in power against perceived threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>.

### Jason Calacanis's View
Calacanis explained the legal basis for the conviction, emphasizing New York's strict stance on falsifying business records and election interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>. He stated that the jury found [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] committed these crimes to save his election chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>. While acknowledging the legal validity of the concepts, Calacanis believes the case was "politically motivated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:38">[01:30:38]</a>. He predicts it will ultimately be a "speeding ticket" that gets overturned or results in a pardon by the governor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>. Calacanis views this case as less legitimate than the document cases or [[january_6_pardon_controversies | January 6]] case, which he considers "legit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. He expressed sadness for America that [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] and Biden are the only choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>.

### Friedberg's View
Friedberg characterized the trial as a "win-win" for [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>. If convicted, it would fuel narratives of unfairness and "lawfare"; if acquitted, it would highlight perceived overreach by prosecutors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. He noted that the political calculus seemed "off" for the prosecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>. Friedberg mentioned reports of [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Trump]]'s donation website crashing and an increase in donations from non-Republican donors, suggesting the conviction has infuriated many people and generated sympathy for [[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Donald Trump]] among independents and undecided voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

## Political Implications
The conviction's timing, just four days before the RNC, makes the phrase "[[us_political_dynamics_and_trump_administration | Donald Trump]] convicted felon" a likely talking point until November 5th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Some believe this verdict will be the Democratic party's "salvation" given their perceived weak candidate, Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:39">[01:36:39]</a>. However, it is also suggested that this strategy will likely not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:20">[01:37:20]</a>.

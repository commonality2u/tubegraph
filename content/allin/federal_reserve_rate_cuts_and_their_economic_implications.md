The Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by half a percentage point, bringing them down from a 23-year high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04">[07:04]</a>. This marks the first rate cut since March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11">[07:11]</a>.

## Rationale for the Rate Cut

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the Fed believes [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] is approaching the 2% target and they do not want the job market to soften further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17">[07:17]</a>. Powell also noted that immigration has contributed to softening the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30">[07:30]</a>. Recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed 2.9% in July and 2.5% in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38">[07:38]</a>. Following the news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 300 points to an all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04">[08:04]</a>. Many anticipate more rate cuts at every upcoming meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>.

## Historical Context of Rate Cuts

Since 1994, the Fed has initiated a cutting cycle six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23">[08:23]</a>.
*   In 1995, 1998, and 2019, cuts began with 25 basis points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31">[08:31]</a>.
*   In 2001, 2007 (after the Great Financial Crisis), and March 2020 (due to COVID), cuts started with a 50 basis point reduction, indicating severe situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33">[08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41">[08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49">[08:49]</a>.

Past market performance following 50 basis point cuts:
*   In 2001, the market fell 31% in the two years following the cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>.
*   In 2007, the market fell 26% after two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01">[09:01]</a>.
*   In 2020, despite initial fears, the market increased by 44% over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06">[09:06]</a>. This 2020 outcome is seen as having a "big asterisk" as it was largely artificially created by a global shutdown and massive injections of money into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18">[09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40">[09:40]</a>.

## Economic Implications and Outlook

### Signs of Economic Tension
Rate cuts are generally a stimulatory move by the Federal Reserve, indicating tension in the economy, specifically between employment and unemployment, and between earnings growth and contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17">[10:17]</a>. The expectation is for the Fed to continue cutting rates, potentially down to 2% or 3% by the end of 2026, to stimulate the economy again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23">[10:23]</a>.

Historically, markets tend to fall once a rate cut cycle begins because the subsequent quarters often demonstrate the economic pressure the Fed anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34">[10:34]</a>. While this pressure has not yet fully flowed through into earnings or company descriptions of market conditions (with a few exceptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49">[10:49]</a>, if real pressure emerges, it will likely lead to a contraction in the value of financial assets as company earnings decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08">[11:08]</a>.

### Recession Concerns
The 50 basis point rate cuts in 2001 and 2007 occurred just before recessions, leading many to question if a recession is imminent now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25">[11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36">[11:36]</a>. While Powell's comments suggest the economy is in "very good shape" and that [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] has been tamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53">[11:53]</a>, the magnitude of the cut (50 basis points instead of 25) is seen as unusual if the economy were truly "hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08">[12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25">[12:25]</a>.

The market's smart financial actors are betting that terminal rates will be dramatically lower than current levels within the next 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46">[12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50">[12:50]</a>. This suggests they anticipate a recession or contraction, possibly alongside downward revisions to GDP data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18">[13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31">[13:31]</a>.

### The Yield Curve as an Indicator
The yield curve inverting (short-term interest rates rising above long-term rates) has historically been an almost perfect indicator of a coming recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23">[16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29">[16:29]</a>. A recession typically occurs when the yield curve "de-inverts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56">[16:56]</a>, meaning the Fed sees economic weakness and cuts short rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00">[17:00]</a>. The yield curve has recently de-inverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20">[17:20]</a>, raising concerns about whether a recession will follow or if the Fed can achieve a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24">[17:24]</a>.

### Labor Market Softening
The labor market has significantly changed from a period of high job availability (11-12 million jobs at peak) and difficulty finding talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55">[13:55]</a>. Now, there is an abundance of viable candidates for positions, leading to concerns about the hollowing out of mid-paying jobs due to factors like increased immigration and outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33">[14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00">[15:00]</a>.

In the tech sector, while conditions are not as "absurdly frothy" as during the 2020-2021 bubble, they remain good, driven by an "AI Tailwind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46">[15:46]</a>. However, outside of AI, valuations and company operations have returned to more normal levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04">[16:04]</a>.

### Venture Capital and Liquidity
The [[market_trends_and_fed_policy | Venture Capital (VC) industry]] is experiencing a tough period, with fund managers struggling to generate liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:58">[48:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:47">[49:47]</a>. The typical duration for companies to return money has extended from 5-7 years to 11-13 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11">[50:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48">[50:48]</a>. Many funds, especially from the 2018 vintage, have yet to make a single distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:11">[48:11]</a>.

The industry was flooded with capital in 2020 and 2021 due to the federal government's injection of $10 trillion in liquidity in response to COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:31">[55:31]</a>. This led to larger funding rounds and inflated valuations, significantly impacting returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58">[55:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:02">[56:02]</a>. The average Venture Fund's expected 2x return was eroded as entry prices artificially doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10">[56:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:15">[56:15]</a>. The high number of startups entering the same verticals also spread out talent, earnings, and customer bases, leading to reduced ownership stakes for VCs due to higher valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42">[57:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:46">[57:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04">[58:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:07">[58:07]</a>.

The venture industry is now working through this "hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:21">[56:21]</a>. The good news is that the rise of AI represents a highly exciting technological wave, comparable to the internet's emergence in the mid-to-late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:39">[56:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:44">[56:44]</a>. This new wave could lead to another "Golden Era" for venture capital, especially if interest rate cuts continue and [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] remains tamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the decline in the percentage of first-time VC managers raising a second fund (from over 50% to below 15%) suggests a market correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47">[48:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:17">[59:17]</a>. This may lead to less capital being raised, potentially foreshadowing that new companies will require significantly less capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:28">[59:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:30">[59:30]</a>. The IPO process and the ability for companies to access public market capital are considered fundamentally broken, requiring reinvention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

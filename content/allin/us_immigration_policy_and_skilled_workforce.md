Discussions surrounding [[immigration_policies_and_labor_market_dynamics_in_the_us | immigration policy]] often highlight the challenges faced by businesses under the current administration, particularly concerning a framework for various industries and the acquisition of skilled talent [01:42:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Current Challenges in Business
Businesses, including those in crypto and real estate, are experiencing difficulties such as a lack of clear government frameworks for operation and a credit crunch due to high interest rates, which impedes mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and real estate loans [01:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. These challenges contribute to a difficult business environment [02:07:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Proposed Reforms for Skilled Workers

Former President Trump has promised to address the need for high-skilled workers in the U.S., emphasizing the importance of recruiting the "best and brightest" globally [00:44:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Green Cards for Graduates
A key proposal is to automatically grant green cards to individuals who graduate from U.S. colleges, including junior colleges and those with doctorate degrees [00:44:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. This policy aims to enable talented graduates to remain in the country and contribute to the economy [00:44:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

### Addressing the Talent Drain
There are numerous instances of highly intelligent graduates from top U.S. colleges who wish to stay and build companies in the U.S. but are unable to due to [[us_immigration_and_labor_market_dynamics | immigration]] restrictions [00:45:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. Many of these individuals return to their home countries, such as India or China, to start multi-billion dollar companies that could have been established in the U.S., leading to a loss of employment opportunities [00:45:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. The argument is that companies require a pool of brilliant people, and current policies force these individuals out of the country [00:45:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This proposed change is intended to end immediately upon a new administration [00:45:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

## Context of Border Policy
While advocating for a more open policy for high-skilled workers, the importance of border security and the construction of a wall is also emphasized [00:40:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. The previous administration reportedly built hundreds of miles of wall according to border patrol specifications, which significantly reduced illegal crossings [00:42:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. It is asserted that the subsequent administration dismantled parts of the border security measures, leading to an "invasion" of the country by individuals, including those from jails and mental institutions, and terrorists [00:42:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. The belief that an open border policy is intentional is voiced by some [00:43:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

## Post-Interview Analysis on Skilled Immigration

Post-interview analysis indicates that the stance on H-1Bs and green cards for graduates represents a significant and positive shift in the discussion on [[us_immigration_and_labor_market_dynamics | immigration]], moving beyond just border security to focus on talent recruitment [00:52:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>, [00:59:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. This is seen as particularly beneficial for the technology community, which faces challenges in hiring skilled personnel [00:59:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

On the other hand, some analysts also consider whether an open border policy might be driven by an economic argument to increase the low-cost labor pool, especially given the high costs of infrastructure projects in the U.S. compared to countries like China [01:13:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This points to a potential tension between different economic objectives within [[impact_of_immigration_policies | immigration policy]].

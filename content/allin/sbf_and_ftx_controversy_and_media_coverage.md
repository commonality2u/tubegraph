The [[ftx_collapse_and_its_implications | FTX]] controversy, involving its founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), has drawn significant attention, particularly regarding its financial irregularities and the subsequent [[media_coverage_and_bias | media coverage]] [00:07:14].

## Allegations and Scale of Fraud
The CEO overseeing the liquidation of [[ftx_collapse_and_its_implications | Enron]], John J. Ray, stated that in his 40 years of experience with corporate failures, including situations with criminal activity and malfeasance, he had "never in [his] career seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as has occurred here" at [[ftx_collapse_and_its_implications | FTX]] [01:34:54].

A significant amount of money, potentially billions of dollars, is alleged to have gone missing [01:31:27]. For example, SBF allegedly loaned himself a billion dollars and the head of engineering $500 million off the balance sheet [01:30:49]. The auditing firm for [[ftx_collapse_and_its_implications | FTX]], Prager Metis, was reportedly based in the metaverse, and its address was in Decentraland [01:37:12].

## SBF's Public Persona and "Woke" Signaling
SBF was noted for his adeptness at [[sbfs_media_strategy_and_ftx_culpability | media strategy]], particularly in playing a "dumb game" where he would "say all the right s**t so everyone likes us" [01:15:57]. This included discussions about ethics, which he viewed as a game with winners and losers [01:17:49]. SBF admitted that reputations were "made of" such signaling [01:17:56].

SBF's philanthropic efforts primarily targeted "woke" causes and issues, such as pandemic prevention and early warning systems [01:19:13]. It was also suggested that SBF sought to fund his brother's organization via a California ballot initiative, which would have disbursed taxpayer money [01:20:01].

## Media Scrutiny and Perceived Bias
There is a perception that certain [[media_coverage_and_bias | media outlets]] and non-profits were influenced by [[sbfs_media_strategy_and_ftx_culpability | SBF's virtue signaling]] [01:18:48]. It is suggested that SBF "played them all" by saying "the right woke words," leading them to "cover for the most enormous grift that's ever been perpetrated" [01:18:24].

> "It's the quid pro quo of our civilization: be woke and you will have indefinite career opportunities." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>

It is also alleged that these publications are reluctant to cover the full extent of the [[ftx_collapse_and_its_implications | FTX fraud]] because they were "complicit in his reputation laundering" [01:31:05]. As an example, the New York Times published a "puff piece" on SBF before the fraud allegations gained widespread traction, which was criticized for not asking about the fraud [01:31:10]. This contrasts with the intense [[media_coverage_and_bias | media hysteria]] surrounding issues like the layoffs at Twitter [01:14:17].

## Regulators and Power Structures
A critique was made about regulators and their effectiveness, suggesting that the "actual filter is not 'is this a scam?' The actual filter is 'is this MMT?'" implying that regulatory decisions are often driven by political considerations rather than consumer protection [01:33:37].

> "It's not consumer protection, it's re-election." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>

It is argued that if one is part of "interlocking power structures" such as the New York Times, the regulatory state, or the Democratic Party, they receive preferential treatment [01:33:55]. The first investigation by the House of Representatives should focus on [[sbfs_media_strategy_and_ftx_culpability | SBF]] and [[ftx_collapse_and_its_implications | FTX]], rather than other political figures, due to the scale of the alleged fraud [01:34:29].

## Investor Due Diligence
A list of investors in [[ftx_collapse_and_its_implications | FTX]] and Alameda Research was described as a "who's who of people who did no diligence whatsoever" [01:36:13]. While some investors received audited financials and legal representation, the fraudulent nature of the conveyed numbers suggested that many were duped [01:37:37]. Some potential investors, like the podcasters, reportedly did not receive any financials, only verbal accounts [01:38:11].

Recent data indicates a decline in the usage and interest levels of [[chatgpt_and_ais_impact_on_various_industries | ChatGPT]] and other AI models like Bard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. This trend is observed in Google Trends and usage data from Similarweb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

## Observed Usage Decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>
[[chatgpt_and_ais_impact_on_various_industries | ChatGPT]] usage appears to be falling from a peak in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>. There was a modest increase from March to April, an even less modest increase from April to May, and then a decline from May to June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>.

## Potential Reasons for Decline
Several factors are proposed for this declining usage:

*   **Educational Usage Cycle** One primary theory suggests the decline is driven by educational usage, as many students used [[chatgpt_and_ais_impact_on_various_industries | ChatGPT]] for essays and schoolwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. School being out of session contributes to this drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>.
*   **Novelty Wearing Off** The initial curiosity factor may have played out, and the novelty of the product has worn off for many users who were initially testing its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **Usage Vacuum Fulfillment** These products launched during a "usage vacuum," a period where consumers were "hankering for something really interesting and unique and new and novel" after the "total fart in the wind" that was VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:33">[01:18:33]</a>. This led to an explosion of initial usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Skepticism about Current Interface
Some express skepticism about the current state and long-term viability of the chat interface for widespread consumer adoption:

*   **Limited Functionality Compared to Expectations** The current system is seen as only a "50-60% copy" of what it could be, with less traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.
*   **Lack of Novelty** The main challenge for companies like Meta introducing AI is not just copying existing models but inventing a "de novo feature" that genuinely makes people want to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.
*   **Product Difficulty and Limitations** [[chatgpt_and_ais_impact_on_various_industries | ChatGPT]] is described as hard to use, particularly for general consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Most people paying $20/month for it is compared to paying for Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. Plugins are a "pain in the ass," and without them, there's no new data past 2021, rendering it "Dead on Arrival as a product" for current information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Performance Issues** One user experienced error messages when trying to use the mobile app for a simple search, forcing them to revert to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. Google is considered "much more performant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>.
*   **User Interface Friction** The chat interface, compared to the evolution of user interfaces (DOS, Windows, browser, scrolling feeds), requires "more input" for "less output" (mostly textual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>. This creates friction in user adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>.

> "The only winner here is NVIDIA I think the loser here here are most of the VCS who pumped in hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in Rando stuff too early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>

## Future Potential and Evolution of AI
Despite current declines, there's optimism for the future of [[Impact of ChatGPT and AI on various industries | AI]] and chat interfaces, especially beyond consumer chat bots:

*   **Enterprise Use Cases** The most exciting [[Impact of ChatGPT and AI on various industries | AI]] use cases are in enterprise software and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>. These "real [[Impact of ChatGPT and AI on various industries | AI]] leaps" are still 18 to 36 months away from mainstream products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.
*   **Shift to "Action Bots"** The next "10x" feature for consumer-facing chat interfaces will be the move "from information retrieval to action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. This means AI could not only provide information (e.g., best hotels) but also perform actions (e.g., book a hotel directly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. Companies like Meta are expected to launch "Action Bots on WhatsApp and Instagram in the not too distant future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.
*   **Role in New Companies** At the Snowflake Summit, 600 new startups applying for a contest were using an [[chatgpt_and_ais_impact_on_various_industries | application of ChatGPT]] built on Snowflake data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>. This shows "tremendous appetite for people to help Enterprises access that information and build much more seamless less discovery on top of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>.
*   **Native for New Generations** Younger generations interact with their phones primarily through voice and chat, making this interface "so native to the way that they interact with the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>. One speaker had a "brilliant conversation with [[chatgpt_and_ais_impact_on_various_industries | ChatGPT]] about what happened with rates and inflation" using only his voice, finding it "way better than the experience I would have on Google" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.
*   **Improving Performance** While the product is currently hard to use, speakers expect improvements in accuracy, performance, speed, and interface, along with added features, to achieve the next level of usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.

Despite these future potentials, the current cost structure of [[chatgpt_and_ais_impact_on_various_industries | ChatGPT]] ($20-40/month) is seen as a barrier for mass adoption, particularly for younger users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:19">[01:28:19]</a>.

Concerns about crime and security in American cities have become a significant topic of discussion, with observations highlighting a perceived decline in the quality of life in many urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This decline is frequently linked to various policy decisions and socio-economic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Perceived Decline in Quality of Life

Several major American cities are cited as examples where the quality of life has reportedly deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Cities like Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Oakland are mentioned as experiencing significant crime waves, leading to areas where only criminals can survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

The nature of crime has also evolved, with a "new phenomena" observed where large groups, often young people, enter stores with masks and steal everything from televisions to air conditioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Drugstores in places like New York are described as having products covered with bars and glass, requiring customers to wait for a clerk to access basic items like aspirin or a toothbrush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

> "when you see a department store that was so proud they opened up a new store in a certain city and all of a sudden this over the last couple of years has happened this phenomena where 500 usually young people walk into the store and take everything they have masks on they walk out with television sets air conditioners they walk out with everything this is a new phenomena that's taking place and it's it's incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>

The retail sector, once proud of new store openings, is now witnessing a significant retreat from certain cities due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. The overwhelming majority of cities facing these severe problems are described as Democrat-run and characterized by high taxes and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Rising Crime

Several factors are identified as contributing to the current state of crime and insecurity:

*   **Diminished Police Authority:** There is a belief that police officers have had their power taken away, making them hesitant to intervene in criminal acts due to fear of losing their pensions, homes, or even being jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. This leads to a situation where police are "told not to do anything" to stop crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This aligns with broader [[Social issues and their impact on society including trans rights and media portrayal of police | social issues and their impact on society including media portrayal of police]].
*   **"No Cash Bail" Policies:** The implementation of "no cash bail" policies and limits on the value of stolen goods that trigger arrest (e.g., stealing less than $2,000) are highlighted as contributing to increased theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
*   **High Taxation and Regulation:** High taxes and excessive regulation are seen as barriers to business, leading to a "broken productivity" cycle that correlates with increased crime and decreased quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This relates to [[Taxation and regulation in the United States | taxation and regulation in the United States]].
*   **Open Borders and Immigration:** The current border situation is described as an "invasion" of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:45:00">[42:45:00]</a>, with concerns about people entering from jails, prisons, mental institutions, and even terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>. This is a critical challenge related to [[Immigration policy and border security challenges | immigration policy and border security challenges]]. The reversal of executive orders and leaving "holes" in the border wall are seen as deliberate actions leading to an "open border" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:55:00">[42:55:00]</a>.

> "I never understood why the wall was so controversial you know every country needs to have a border and a wall is a really good way to enforce a border I never understood why they were so animated about stopping you from building the wall after you ran on that issue in 2016 they held you up for years with litigation and then like you said they wouldn't just finish the little pieces of it and they left big holes in it and I think you're right the only conclusion is they want an open border I mean how else do you expose like that they want to destroy our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>

## Proposed Solutions

To address these challenges, several policy directions are suggested:

*   **Reduce Regulation and Taxes:** Cutting regulations and providing significant tax cuts are proposed as primary ways to stimulate business and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. It is argued that reducing regulations has historically been even more effective than tax cuts in fostering investment and bringing back capital to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Strengthen Border Security:** Reinstating and completing border wall construction, along with policies like "Remain in Mexico," are emphasized to control the influx of undocumented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02:00">[41:02:00]</a>.
*   **Empower Local Authorities:** Returning control over issues like education and environmental policy to the states is advocated to reduce federal bureaucracy and potentially improve outcomes at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Skilled Immigration:** A policy to automatically grant green cards to graduates of U.S. colleges, including junior colleges, is proposed to retain the "best and brightest" talent and boost the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a>. This would allow highly educated individuals to stay in the country, start companies, and employ thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>.
*   **Address [[Issues surrounding Americas overclassification problem and its implications | Overclassification and Bureaucracy]]:** A commitment to increasing transparency in government, exemplified by the promise to release the remaining JFK files, is seen as a way to "rebuild trust in our government and institutions" and address the influence of "deep state" elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.

There is a belief that the current administration's policies, including those on energy and spending, have exacerbated inflation and contributed to the country's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. The overall sentiment is that a shift towards pro-growth, deregulation, and strong border enforcement is necessary to improve crime and security in American cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

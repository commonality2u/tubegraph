From: [[allin]] <br/> 

A significant "AI FOMO frenzy" is currently underway, characterized by massive fundraising in the [[generative AI technologies | generative AI]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Recent reports indicate there are now 500 [[generative AI technologies | generative AI]] startups, excluding [[microsofts_investment_in_openai_and_generative_ai_technologies | Microsoft's]] $10 billion investment in [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Collectively, these startups have raised over $11 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This activity spans across audio, image, and text generation, signaling a multimedia revolution akin to the rise of personal computers in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## AI as a Platform Shift

Many prominent investors view [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_economic_impact | AI]] as the next major platform shift.

> "I actually think that [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_economic_impact | AI]] is the next platform shift in the same way that mobile was the one before internet was the one before. So I think [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_economic_impact | AI]] is real, but I said earlier we're going to overestimate it in a short term, we're going to invest in everything in the same way that in 1999 we invested in everything. But then [[googles_ai_investment_and_strategy | Google]] came out of that or Facebook came out of that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
> â€” Doug Leone, Sequoia Capital

Brad Gerstner concurs, suggesting [[ai_as_a_computing_platform_and_its_potential_disruption | AI]] could be even bigger than both the internet and mobile platform shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He highlights that the $10-11 billion invested in 500 [[ai_investment_and_technology | AI]] companies pales in comparison to, for example, Meta's $20 billion annual spending on AR/VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. David Sacks echoes this, stating that [[ai_technology_and_market_trends | AI]] is definitely on par with major platform shifts like mobile, social, or cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Market Dynamics

The current investment climate for [[ai_investment_and_technology | AI]] is driven by a complex interplay of incentives, value capture considerations, and evolving market conditions.

### Investor Incentives and Capital Deployment

Chamath Palihapitiya emphasizes the importance of understanding incentives in investment, citing Charlie Munger's dictum: "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. With Credit Suisse offering 6.5% for a three-month T-bill, venture investors are under immense pressure from their Limited Partners (LPs) to deploy capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For long-term startup investments (10-15 years), returns need to be 20-25% to make sense against a 6.5% short-term risk-free rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This pressure often leads to capital being "torched" as many companies won't amount to much, creating excessive correlation and zero time diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Brad Gerstner, however, points out that LPs typically have a 10-year view and understand that current rates won't last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. Instead of pausing investments, they are narrowing their focus to the top 10% of venture firms that demonstrate a strong track record and selectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:04]</a>. This means sub-scale funds with no distributions (DPI) will face significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

### Value Capture in the AI Ecosystem

The question of where value will be captured in the [[ai_technology_and_market_trends | AI]] ecosystem remains uncertain. Brad Gerstner draws a parallel to the internet boom: investing in early search engines like Yahoo or Infoseek led to losses, while [[googles_ai_investment and strategy | Google]] emerged as the dominant player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. He suggests that value could accrue to major players like [[microsofts_investment_in_openai_and_generative_ai_technologies | Microsoft]] and [[googles_ai_investment_and_strategy | Google]] at the foundation model level, similar to iOS and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

Chamath Palihapitiya offers a "pick and shovel" framework, akin to the 1849 Gold Rush:
*   **The "Gold Panners"**: Companies building large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **The "Pick and Shovel Providers"**: Companies at the silicon layer, re-architecting compute for [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_economic_impact | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Firms like AMD and Nvidia are seen as clear winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **"White Truffles"**: Unique, singular sources of data that, when used in reinforcement learning, significantly enhance [[ai_technology_and_market_trends | AI]] output. Examples include Facebook and Quora, but startups gathering sufficient data could also become "white truffles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Chamath notes that most current [[AI investment and technology | AI investments]] are in the "bologna in the middle" (commoditized models), rather than silicon or unique data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### OpenAI's API and Developer Ecosystem

[[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]] recently announced a 90% reduction in the metered rate for its [[generative AI technologies | ChatGPT]] 3.5 API, with a 4.0 version planned later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. An API (Application Programming Interface) allows developers to build on top of a service, meaning companies like Notion can integrate [[generative AI technologies | large language models]] without needing in-house [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_economic_impact | AI]] expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Chamath suggests that [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]]'s strategy might be to cut costs so drastically that it becomes unfeasible for others to compete, allowing them to take a "minuscule take rate" and become a pervasive, very large company, similar to cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. This potentially explains their significant deal with [[microsofts_investment_in_openai_and_generative_ai_technologies | Microsoft]], as they may need substantial capital to subsidize their developer platform with negative gross margins for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

David Sacks points out that many founders are strategically marketing themselves as [[ai_technology_and_market_trends | AI companies]] by building even one feature on top of the [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] API, capitalizing on VCs' desire to invest in the "next big wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. This leads to a rapid increase in the number of purported [[ai_investment_and_technology | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

## The Current Investment Climate

Jason Calacanis notes that the current environment, with more measured [[ai_investment_and_technology | AI investments]] and milestone-based funding, feels like the "best it's been for me as an angel investor seed investor or seed fund for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. Deals are taking longer to close (six weeks), and founders are more thoughtful about deploying capital, building models, and managing salaries and hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.

Sacks differentiates between the tech ecosystem and the broader economy, arguing that tech has already experienced its bubble and crash (2021-2022), and new companies are starting with a clean slate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>. He believes that innovation will continue regardless of macroeconomic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

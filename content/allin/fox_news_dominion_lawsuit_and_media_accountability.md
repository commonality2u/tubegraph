The Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News has brought significant attention to [[partisan_media_practices_and_regulation | media accountability]] and defamation laws in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. Dominion is suing Fox for 1.6 billion dollars in damages over claims made on air regarding technology-enabled election fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

## Allegations of False Claims
During the period following the last election cycle, Fox News hosts were accused of knowingly spreading false claims that the election was stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>, despite internal knowledge that these claims were untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. This engagement was described as an "entertainment" approach, allowing individuals to present baseless allegations on air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.

Rupert Murdoch, chairman of Fox News, admitted under oath that he "could have" stopped the hosts from highlighting these false allegations but did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He stated he would have liked the network to be stronger in denouncing the claims in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. His motivation for allowing the claims was attributed to a fear of their audience segment going to rival networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>, essentially prioritizing "greed" (audience retention) over truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.

### Different Approaches by Fox Hosts
Within Fox News, there were reportedly two groups of hosts:
*   **Trump Loyalists**: Some hosts, such as Hannity, not only platformed but also endorsed the false claims made by figures like Sydney Powell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Hannity's text messages indicated he didn't believe the story but endorsed it as a Trump loyalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.
*   **Skeptics**: Other hosts, including Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, were skeptical of the Sydney Powell theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. Tucker Carlson notably grilled Sydney Powell in a 20-minute interview, pressing her for evidence and effectively dismantling her claims on air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.

## Defamation Laws and "Actual Malice"
The legal standard for defamation in the U.S., stemming from *New York Times v. Sullivan*, requires plaintiffs to prove "actual malice" â€“ meaning the defamatory statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. Rupert Murdoch's testimony, while admitting to platforming known falsehoods due to fear of losing audience, did not explicitly admit to "actual malice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. This highlights a critical aspect of existing libel laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>.

## The Debate on Media Accountability
There is a strong argument for rewriting defamation laws, potentially overturning *New York Times v. Sullivan*, to make media outlets liable for knowingly false information without requiring proof of malicious intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. This change would affect not only outlets like Fox News but also others like CNN and MSNBC, requiring them to revise their coverage practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. It's argued that if media entities knew information was false and published it, that should be sufficient for liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.

This discussion is part of a broader conversation about [[the_dynamics_and_challenges_of_media_bias_and_journalism_activism | media bias and journalism activism]] and the [[loss_of_trust_in_media_and_search_engine_bias | loss of trust in media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:58">[01:18:58]</a>. The principle of freedom of speech is generally valued, but there's a question of whether it extends to knowingly lying and platforming conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

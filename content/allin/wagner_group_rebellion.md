## Overview of Events

On Friday, June 23, 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization led by Evgeni Prigozhin, launched what appeared to be an armed insurrection against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>. The group occupied portions of Rostov-on-Don, a city of over a million people, which also serves as a regional capital and headquarters of Russia's Southern Military District <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:29">[03:26:29]</a>. Following this, Wagner forces set off towards Moscow but abruptly halted approximately 200 kilometers from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

A negotiation reportedly took place, involving the president of Belarus, after which Prigozhin decided to stand down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated he would not prosecute Prigozhin for these actions, granting him immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. It was announced that all members of the Wagner Group were given the option to return home or join the Russian military, and the Wagner Group was to be dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Interpretations and Analysis

Some analysts, including David Sacks, do not believe the event was staged, but rather a genuine insurrection or mutiny by Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The trigger for the mutiny was likely the Russian Ministry of Defense's efforts to merge the Wagner organization into the regular Russian army, requiring Wagner's men to sign contracts that would result in a significant loss of income and status for Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. For months, Prigozhin had been openly criticizing the Ministry of Defense, particularly Minister of Defense Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Prigozhin's actions, which included marching about 8,000 men into Rostov-on-Don and sending approximately 3,000 men towards Moscow, had "coup optionality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. He aimed to gauge the level of support Putin had and who might join him, issuing statements that the Russian regime could consider seditious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Despite claiming a missile attack by the Ministry of Defense on his base as the reason for his "march for justice," there is evidence this attack was staged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. He carefully avoided direct criticism of Putin, but his comments were indirectly critical of the war's overall conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

During the march, no significant figures, including generals, regional governors, or members of the Duma, publicly supported Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This lack of support led Putin to declare Prigozhin's actions an act of treason and a "stab in the back" on national television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Prigozhin's options became limited, leading him to accept a deal brokered by Lukashenka for exile in Belarus in exchange for his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

While the mutiny was an embarrassment and a "black eye" for the Russian regime, raising questions about Putin's stability, it ultimately led to a consolidation of Russian society behind him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Despite Prigozhin's popularity as a "war hero" from the Battle of Bakhmut, the Russian people supported Putin, whose poll numbers reportedly reached around 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. This support was highlighted by a patriotic Russian song, "I Am Russian," which became a number one chart-buster in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. Some argue that this popular sentiment is a result of state propaganda and that surveys in Russia cannot be trusted given Putin's control through violence and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

The incident was seen by some as a "raw shock test" where both sides overplayed their narratives: some on the left declaring the imminent collapse of Putin's regime, and some on the right claiming widespread support for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. It highlighted that the much-hyped Ukrainian counter-offensive was not succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. The United States has been criticized for inserting itself into an "existential fight to the death" between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

## Yevgeny Prigozhin's Background

Prior to the attempted coup, many, including Jason Calacanis, were unfamiliar with the Wagner Group or Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. Prigozhin is described as a "street thug" who spent nine years in jail for selling illegal hot dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>. He rose in Russia as a businessman in the supermarket chain business, which led him to create a catering business that served the Kremlin, earning him the nickname "Putin's Chef" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. From this position, he was licensed to create the Wagner Group, a private military corporation of mercenaries active mainly in Africa, working on behalf of governments to protect mineral resources or oil wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:19:13]</a>. Prigozhin is characterized as emotional and erratic, constantly acting like a "loose cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.

## Implications for the Ukraine Conflict

Some voiced concern about the "unrestrained glee" and "delirium" on social media at the idea of Prigozhin toppling Putin and becoming the custodian of Russia's thousands of nuclear weapons, warning to "be careful what you wish for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. It was suggested that a replacement for Putin would more likely be an "even worse dictator" or a hardliner, rather than a liberal figure like Navalny or a Gorbachev 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.

The event is predicted to put more pressure on Putin to conduct the war in a more violent way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. Hardliners on Putin's right have criticized him for treating the war as a "special military operation" instead of an all-out war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. Prigozhin likely expected more support from Russian ultra-nationalists and military figures who desire a full mobilization of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>. The mutiny underscores that the war is existential for Putin personally, meaning he will likely do "whatever it takes to win," potentially leading to a full mobilization in Russia and a "next point of escalation" if the Ukrainian counter-offensive succeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

The Federal Reserve recently held a meeting to discuss overnight rates and their economic outlook, influenced by current [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] and economic activity data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. The published minutes from this meeting provide insight into the Fed's perspective and future intentions regarding monetary policy.

## Federal Reserve's Assessment
The Federal Reserve, in its latest meeting, acknowledged that [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] remained "unacceptably high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May, indicated that the decline in [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] was slower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. While core goods [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] had moderated since mid-last year, its slowdown in recent months was less rapid than expected, despite easing supply chain constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

### Consumer Spending and Household Wealth
Participants observed that consumer spending had been stronger than expected this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Aggregate household wealth remained high, as equity and home prices had not significantly declined from recent highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. However, some participants noted signs that consumers were facing "increasingly tighter budgets" due to high [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]], particularly for low-income households, despite accumulated excess savings during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

### Monetary Policy Outlook
Although the Fed decided not to raise rates at this meeting, they anticipate two more 25-basis-point rate hikes later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. This stance aligns with the Fed's apparent strategy to orchestrate a "pretty soft landing" for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. Their own forecast for CPI indicates a significant decline by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

## Labor Market Indicators
The Federal Reserve closely monitors labor market data to assess the economy's temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
A recent ADP jobs report showed over 450,000 new jobs created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. However, the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) report, considered a leading indicator, showed that more people took jobs than anticipated, leading to fewer job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. This suggests a healthy trend in the economy, as people are now taking jobs that were previously unfilled due to COVID concerns or government stimulus checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Approximately half of the new jobs were in hospitality and leisure, addressing desperately needed positions during the peak summer travel season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

## The Soft Landing Debate
Brad Gerstner suggests that the Fed seems to be orchestrating a "pretty soft landing" for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. He notes that the market initially "fought it" but the NASDAQ was up significantly in the first half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. He argues that while [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] might be "stickier on the way down," it doesn't necessarily mean the economy will crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. With job openings coming down and [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] trending lower, he believes a softer landing is a strong possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

Chamath Palihapitiya agrees there will be "no hard landing," especially with China stimulating its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. He believes the US has done the best job among developed nations in getting [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. He supports the Fed's strategy of keeping rates relatively elevated to give them "bullets in the chamber" for future interventions if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. The current rates, close to six percent, provide positive optionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

David Sacks, however, believes the US is not "out of the woods quite yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>. He highlights the inverted yield curve, which is the most inverted and longest-standing it has been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. This inversion places "incredible pressure on the banking system" because their business model of borrowing short and lending long doesn't work when short rates are higher than long rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

### Banking Sector Stress and Credit Conditions
The Fed minutes included a discussion on the stress in the banking sector, with participants generally noting that "banking stresses had receded" and "conditions in the banking sector were much improved since March" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. They continue to judge that tightening credit conditions, spurred by earlier banking sector stress, would likely "weigh further on economic activity, but the extent remained uncertain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

David Sacks points out that the Fed engaged in an "extraordinary intervention" a few months ago to save the banking system through the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. This program allowed banks to present US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities at par value, providing significant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

Chamath notes a "looming credit crisis in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>, particularly concerning the "debt wall that Corporate America is about to hit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. Many companies and private equity firms are over-leveraged and will face significant challenges if [[federal_reserve_rate_cuts_and_their_economic_implications | rates don't go down]] materially in the next 18-24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. He predicts the federal government will likely intervene to "monetize that debt" and "support that commercial real estate sector" through structured lending programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, due to the significant amount of these assets held by pension funds and life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

## International Economic Comparisons
Chamath highlights that while the US is managing [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] well, other Western developed nations face significant economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **UK:** The UK is in "a lot of trouble" with its rates potentially reaching seven or eight percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>, and [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]] still rising (7.9% in May, up from 7.8% in April) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. Its economic situation is "really bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>, seen as a consequence of leaving the EU, which would have smoothed out variants and provided a larger balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Eurozone:** The Eurozone, including Germany, is likely "a quarter into a recession already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>, largely stemming from the cutoff of cheap Russian gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **China:** China faces "super super trouble" and "imploding" internal demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Its export controls are not helping solve the problem, as they accelerate Western economies' desire to de-leverage from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

The overall [[state_of_the_market_and_economic_outlook | setup]] is "very complicated," but the US economy "looks really good frankly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

## Market Outlook and Investment Strategy
The market's implied Fed fund rate changes indicate a peak at around 5.45% by November of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. Subsequently, there could be a shift towards [[federal_reserve_rate_cuts_and_their_economic_implications | rate cuts]] as CPI and job numbers continue to roll over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. Brad Gerstner advises against trying to "call the Market as though you know you have no idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>, instead suggesting adjusting exposure based on market sentiment. High exposures are warranted when the world is panicked, and should be reeled in as markets price in a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

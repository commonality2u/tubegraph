Discussions on the United States potentially expanding its territory and increasing the number of states have been initiated, with some commentators viewing these proposals through a strategic lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>.

## Trump's Proposals and Strategic Reasoning
Donald Trump has proposed ideas regarding the United States growing from 50 to 60 or 70 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:52">[01:34:52]</a>. While the media has sometimes portrayed these as unconventional, some interpret them as having a prescient strategic basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>.

A key idea proposed by Trump involves Greenland, motivated by [[climate_change_and_natural_disasters | climate change]] and the melting Arctic ice shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:34">[01:35:34]</a>. The melting ice opens up a new shipping lane in the northern passage, which could become as important as the Panama Canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>. Strategic agreements with Canada and Greenland could grant the U.S. monopoly control over this critical maritime shipping lane, which is considered a vital strategic, military, and economic asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. The aim is to prevent countries like [[USChina relations and the concept of containment | China]] and Russia from militarizing and taking control of this passage as the ice sheet melts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:41">[01:36:41]</a>.

The communication style for these proposals, while "colorful," is seen by some as a brilliant way to gain attention and allow millions to understand and support the underlying strategic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.

## Broader Expansion Concepts
Beyond specific strategic proposals like Greenland, there's a broader interest in expanding the number of U.S. states. The idea of having 60 states within one's lifetime is supported, including potentially adding territories from the Caribbean or Europe through an "open invitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>.

Specific additional territories mentioned as potential future "dominoes" for statehood include:
*   Cuba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:58">[01:37:58]</a>
*   Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>
*   Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>
*   India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>

This broader expansion concept is rooted in the belief that many countries and people deeply resonate with [[American exceptionalism and national identity | American ideals]] and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>. Some argue that the current political climate in the U.S., particularly a perceived "woke imperialism," has led to a focus on issues that do not benefit the taxpaying citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>.

## Opt-in Imperialism
The concept of "opt-in imperialism" suggests an expansion where new territories would choose to join the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>. This approach involves negotiation and strategic posturing rather than literal declarations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:32">[01:39:32]</a>. It's acknowledged that the U.S. already has a military base and maintains a presence in Greenland, which has existing, though somewhat abandoned, infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:54">[01:5:54]</a>. The objective is to proactively secure [[American political and economic strategies | strategic assets]] and counter the militarization efforts of other global powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:41">[01:36:41]</a>.

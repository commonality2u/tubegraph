David Friedberg recently participated in "Celebrity Jeopardy," delivering a notable performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The show is watched by a large audience, with regular Jeopardy drawing around 7-9 million viewers per night, and Celebrity Jeopardy attracting a couple of million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Performance and Victory
Despite his initial nervousness and "hand ringing" over his impending performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, Friedberg not only won his game but "crushed it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. His win was described as more exciting than watching the World Series of Poker or a Knicks Warriors game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### The "All-in" Moment
A highlight was his "All-in call" where he secured a "deli double" (Daily Double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. When asked about African geography, specifically Mount Kilimanjaro, he answered correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This moment was particularly striking as he had coincidentally been quizzed on African geography the night before at dinner, calling it a "Slum Dog Millionaire moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Preparation and Challenges
Friedberg, a lifelong fan of Jeopardy, watched previous Celebrity Jeopardy episodes to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. He estimated he could get about 60% of the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Buzzer Technique
A significant challenge on Jeopardy is the buzzer timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Contestants cannot buzz in until the light turns on; buzzing too early results in a quarter-second lockout, which makes a "huge difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The light activates precisely when host Ken Jennings finishes enunciating the last syllable of the last word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Friedberg discovered a 150-200 millisecond delay between hearing and seeing, which affected his timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. He even bought a cheap Amazon buzzer to practice but found it unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Mental Game
Despite his preparation, Friedberg experienced "weird brain farts" under pressure, knowing answers but struggling to recall them, or giving incorrect responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He noted the overwhelming feeling of being on set with an audience of about 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Before the show, he deliberately acted like an "idiot" and answered questions wrong during practice rounds to appear less capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### Missed Questions
One notable miss was the "Hoosiers" question during a "Climactic Moments in Sports Movies" category, where he bet $4,000 on a Daily Double and answered "Hoops" instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. He also missed "Cream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. He acknowledges that people tend to focus on the missed answers rather than the correct ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Charitable Impact and Future Challenges
Friedberg played for the Humane Society United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. If he wins the entire tournament, the charity receives a million dollars, with winners' charities receiving more than losers' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

One of the hosts, Jason, proposed a "Jeopardy" or "poker" game between the podcast hosts for all of the "All-in profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, or a televised four-way tournament with sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

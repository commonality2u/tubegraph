The Houthi movement has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, an issue largely underreported in mainstream media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. These attacks are stated to be in revenge for Israel's military campaign in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The Houthis claim they will cease attacks only when Israel allows food and medicine to freely enter Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Impact on Global Trade
The attacks have interrupted one of the world's busiest trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. All five of the world's largest shipping conglomerates have paused transfers through the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This forces ships to reroute around Cape Horn and South Africa to get goods from Asia to Europe, adding thousands of extra miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This situation has already caused oil and gas prices to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, and if it becomes acute, it could significantly impact the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Ryan Peterson, founder of Flexport, highlighted the "massive" impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>:
*   About 30% of all ocean container traffic flows through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Most of this traffic is Asia to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Rerouting around the southern tip of Africa adds about 20% to 25% longer journey time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, which means less capacity in a network business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This translates to a 20-25% cut in shipping capacity for the 30% of affected containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   Approximately 12% of global oil and 8% of liquefied natural gas pass through this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The narrow strait is known as the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, leading into the Red Sea and then through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This has historically been a critical maritime choke point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Houthi attacks spike insurance costs and endanger crew lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Ships cannot operate without insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Ocean freight prices from Asia to Europe have already seen a 3x increase for January, compared to very cheap rates a month or two prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   The impact is greater on Europe than on America, as the Asia-to-East Coast US route is only 8% longer, compared to 20% for Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The Panama Canal's current congestion (at about two-thirds capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> exacerbates this.
*   China has an interest in keeping the route flowing to ship goods quickly to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   Saudi Arabia's biggest port, Jeddah, is also blockaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, which Saudi Arabia is unlikely to tolerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   Shipping freight is generally inelastic; companies will pay more for transport unless margins are extremely thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   Supply chains are not more resilient post-COVID at the physical infrastructure layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, as bottlenecks simply disappeared with decreased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
*   Air freight is still four to five times more expensive than sea freight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>, and its networks are very small in proportion to container ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. A single large container ship holds the equivalent of 10,000 40-foot containers, while a 747 can hold 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. A diversion of even a small amount of ocean freight could rapidly impact air freight prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

## Houthi Group Background and Motives
The Houthis are a Shia group in Yemen that rose in 2014, deposing the monarch and controlling large swaths of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. While often sponsored by Iran, they also have their own agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. They state their actions are in solidarity with the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Initially, they fired rockets at Israel, but these did not reach their target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. They then shifted to firing on and mining ships in the strait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Although they claim to only target ships transacting with Israel, this is not true; many Western ships without Israeli ties have been targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## US Response and Geopolitical Ramifications
The US has announced "Operation Prosperity Guardian" to restore trade flow through the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. However, this may involve military action against the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   The Houthis have already survived almost a decade of Western-sponsored attacks during their war with Saudi Arabia (2015-2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, which caused a massive humanitarian crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. It is unclear what actions would effectively stop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   An expansion of the conflict into Yemen would mean another front in the [[middle_east_conflicts_and_the_israelpalestine_issue | Middle East conflict]] directly involving the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   There have been nearly 80 attacks on US bases in Syria and Iraq by Iranian-sponsored Shia militias in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, highlighting the region as a "powder keg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   If the Red Sea blockade continues through 2024, it could cause significant upward pressure on [[global_conflicts_and_geopolitical_dynamics | global prices]] and inflation, potentially impacting market expectations for rate cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   Saudi Arabia is reluctant to restart its war with the Houthis or hostile relations with Iran, which is why it is not participating in Operation Prosperity Guardian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

## Outlook and Potential Resolutions
The situation's resolution is complicated:
*   The Houthis will not stop until Israel's war in Gaza stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated Israel will not agree to another ceasefire until Hamas is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. The Israeli public largely supports continuing the war until Hamas is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   A ceasefire in Gaza would likely end the Houthi situation quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   There is a risk of this [[israelhamas_conflict_and_potential_solutions | Israel-Hamas conflict]] spiraling into a larger [[middle_east_conflicts_and_the_israelpalestine_issue | regional war]] that pulls in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. The Houthis have even threatened to light Saudi oil fields on fire if the US attacks Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

[!NOTE|Asymmetric Warfare]
The Houthi attacks highlight the challenge of asymmetric warfare: launching a cheap drone (thousands of dollars) that costs millions to shoot down with a missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. The low risk tolerance of Western shipping for any loss (due to insurance implications) means a small investment in attacks can shut down tens of millions of dollars in commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. This behavior may be emboldened by the perceived praise for Hamas following October 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, potentially leading to more such activity in other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

The desire among Middle Eastern powers like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar to build diversified economies for the next 30-40 years pushes them towards stability and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. They do not want to be bookended by two hot wars propagated by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This alignment of interests among regional powers and global trade stakeholders (US, UK, Canada, France, China) could lead to a concerted effort to "clean the decks" and resolve these conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. This push for modernization and deep ties with the West and East is seen as a force greater than traditional conflict forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

However, a quick resolution is not guaranteed, as containing conflicts rather than resolving them is often seen as success in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. The underlying issue of Israel's continued military action in Gaza makes a diplomatic solution difficult if the Houthis maintain their stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.

The Software as a Service (SaaS) industry is experiencing a significant slowdown, particularly highlighted by the recent performance of [[Salesforce and tech stock market performance | Salesforce]], considered a bellwether for the entire sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

## Key Indicators

[[Salesforce and tech stock market performance | Salesforce]], noted as the largest pure SaaS company and the first multi-tenant SaaS firm to operate at scale, showed a "huge slowdown" in its latest quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>.

Key metrics illustrating this downturn include:
*   **Net New Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** The net new ARR added by [[Salesforce and tech stock market performance | Salesforce]] in the previous quarter dropped by two-thirds compared to the prior quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Payback** Despite the decrease in new ARR, sales and marketing spend remained consistent, leading to an explosion in CAC payback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>.
    *   Previously, CAC payback was around two and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>.
    *   It now takes 155 months, or over 10 years, to recoup customer acquisition costs, a model deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.

This indicates that while SaaS valuations corrected earlier in the year, the industry is now witnessing a correction in its top-line revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.

## Impact on Businesses

The extended CAC payback period necessitates a reduction in customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. Companies can achieve this by:
*   **Reducing Marketing Spend** Cutting back on advertising or event expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:33">[01:28:33]</a>.
*   **Reducing Sales Headcount** Implementing layoffs within sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>.

This anticipated contraction in jobs creates a "vicious cycle" for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. Previously, SaaS startups benefited from existing customers expanding their usage (seat expansion), leading to 120-150% of the previous year's revenue just from retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>. With current freezes and layoffs in headcounts, this trend could reverse, resulting in "seat contraction," meaning companies might start the next year with only 80-90% of the prior year's revenue due to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28">[01:29:28]</a>.

## Future Outlook

SaaS companies must adjust their financial planning to account for this new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. Growth expectations have shifted, with "2x is the new 3x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>. Achieving 2x year-over-year growth is now considered as good as, or better than, the 3x growth seen in the previous year, which was easier to achieve in a "frothy" market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. Restraining burn rate is crucial, as predicted revenue may not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>.

Recent studies indicate a significant and concerning impact of microplastics and nanoplastics on human health, with findings suggesting a correlation between plastic presence in the body and adverse health outcomes like heart attack, stroke, and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>.

## Microplastics Detected in Human Arterial Plaque

A team of scientists in Italy collected samples from patients undergoing carotid artery plaque removal, a common cardiac procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. A total of 304 patients agreed to have their removed plaque analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:53">[01:25:53]</a>.

### Key Findings of the Italian Study:
*   The plaque was studied using measurement techniques like electron microscopy and mass spectrometry to detect plastic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.
*   Microplastics and nanoplastics, defined as less than 5mm in size, were found in the plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.
*   The mean level of plastic found was 21 micrograms per milligram of plaque, equating to roughly 1 part plastic for every 50 parts plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. This indicates that plastics are accumulating in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>.
*   A 34-month follow-up revealed that patients with plastic in their blood had a 4.5 times higher likelihood of experiencing a heart attack, stroke, or death from any cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a>.
*   This study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>.

The findings suggest a cumulative problem where microplastics and nanoplastics are accumulating, likely leading to significant adverse health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a>. One theory from the study is that nanoplastics and microplastics may act as "scaffolding" for plaque, potentially accelerating its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>.

## How Plastics May Cause Health Effects

A 2022 paper by a team in Germany and Norway investigated the mechanisms by which plastics cause adverse health effects in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:23">[01:27:23]</a>. They found that tiny plastic fragments bind to dendritic cells and monocytes, which are key cells in the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43">[01:27:43]</a>. When these cells are bound by plastic, they release cytokines, which are pro-inflammatory signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. This causes the immune system to become overactive, increasing inflammation, which can cascade into various adverse health events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>.

## Sources of Microplastics

The plastics found in these studies are primarily:
*   **PET (Polyethylene terephthalate)**: Used in plastic bottles for water and other drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>.
*   **PVC (Polyvinyl chloride)**: Commonly used in plastic plumbing and piping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>.

Tiny bits of these plastic materials can break off when exposed to sunlight or other factors, ending up in water and food supplies, and then being consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. They slowly accumulate in bodies, potentially driving inflammatory responses and adverse health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:37">[01:28:37]</a>.

## Personal Measures and Broader Challenges

Given these findings, some individuals have opted to avoid plastic bottles, switching to glass containers for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>. It is recommended to use glass or stainless steel for drinking containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

However, a broader response to plastic use in the supply chain presents significant challenges due to the ubiquity and affordability enabled by plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

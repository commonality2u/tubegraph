[[Tucker Carlson interview | Tucker Carlson]], a prominent television host, was fired from Fox News on April 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The specific reason for his dismissal has "never been pinned down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Lack of Official Explanation

Carlson himself stated, "I don't know why I was fired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, describing it as an "Agatha Christie story" with "so many suspects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. He was never explicitly told the reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. From a business perspective, the firing was described as "self-destructive" and "so weird" given Carlson was the top performer, and occurred without any prior "notes" or explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Following his departure, Fox News's ratings "cratered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Carlson's Speculations and Stance

Carlson offered his own thoughts on why his departure might have occurred:
*   **Unpopular Opinions** He speculated that he "had a lot of opinions that were unpopular" with people who "might have influenced my show getting canceled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Advertiser Pressure** While acknowledging that advertiser influence "defines news coverage especially on Pharma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> due to pharmaceutical companies being the "biggest Advertiser in television" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, Carlson personally "never had a single person say to me don't say this that I recall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He maintained a clear policy with his supervisors: "as long as I'm on TV I'm going to say what I think is true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, and would not "tow a line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **Controversial Positions** He noted that during his tenure, he took positions on:
    *   The Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>
    *   The COVID vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>
    *   COVID lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>
    *   The origins of COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>
    *   January 6th, which led to some on-air personnel resigning in protest over his suggestions that it was "more complicated than it looked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
    He characterized these positions as "super unpopular" and "truly hated by a lot of the people who worked there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Despite this, he acknowledged that Fox "let me keep saying them so it's kind of hard to complain really at this point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Corporate Dynamics** Carlson was "not shocked" by the firing in a long-term sense, as he believed "you can't kind of give the finger to everybody and persist in a corporate job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. He understood he was "working at the pleasure of the family that runs the company who treated me very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. He also suggested that being "really disliked by a certain set of people" — "affluent people, highly educated people, people who work at NGOs, government, finance" who "hate a certain brand of politics" — could create pressure on his employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>, even if Fox didn't explicitly restrict him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Carlson concluded that while he "wish[es] I could tell horror stories about Fox… forcing me to take some line or other but they really didn't," they simply "didn't want the show anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

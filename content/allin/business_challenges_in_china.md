Doing business in China necessitates a fundamental reevaluation of conventional approaches, as entering the market with pre-conceived notions of success can lead to significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Success requires adopting a "first principles bottoms up" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Traditional Partnership Model

A common piece of advice for market entry in China is to secure a 50/50 partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, companies may opt to build their presence independently if they cannot discern a clear reason for such a partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Initially, some businesses report experiencing fair treatment and an absence of bias on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### The Global "China War"

A significant challenge emerged when what was described as the "China war went global" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This involved the Chinese government, including entities like the sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation (CIC), making [[chinese_investment_strategies | substantial investments]] (hundreds of millions to billions of dollars) in global competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The strategic aim of these investments was to deplete competitors' financial resources, thereby complicating their ability to compete effectively within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

For instance, Apple was compelled to invest a billion dollars in DDI, an unusual move for a company that typically avoids such investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This phenomenon highlights how [[global_impacts_of_chinese_market_entry | Chinese market dynamics]] can project globally, influencing competitive landscapes far beyond its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### High-Stakes Negotiation Tactics

In such a competitive environment, businesses may shift their objectives from outright victory to securing a viable alternative, such as a strong minority stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Achieving [[negotiation_tactics_with_chinese_companies | favorable negotiation outcomes]] in China often requires creating significant leverage, sometimes by aggressive spending to instill fear in competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, during term sheet negotiations, a company might dramatically increase its burn rate, such as spending $75 million a week, to demonstrate its market share growth and apply pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This "poker"-like approach ensures that the other party perceives the threat of continued competition if a deal is not reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Concerns about [[media_coverage_and_bias | media coverage and bias]] and potential regulation of media practices have been raised, particularly in the context of recent elections and the influence of large corporations.

## Allegations of Partisan Bias in Broadcast Media
The recent election highlighted what some perceive as egregious abuses by broadcast networks, with allegations of unequal and biased coverage [00:41:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">00:41:23</a>).

*   **Unequal Coverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>: According to a report by Brent Bazell's media watchdog group, there was a significant disparity in favorable coverage during the election campaign [00:42:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">00:42:21</a>). KLA Harris reportedly received over 80% favorable coverage, while Trump received over 85% negative coverage [00:42:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">00:42:07</a>).
*   **Violation of Fairness Doctrine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>: Broadcast networks like CBS and NBC, which receive free spectrum licenses from the FCC, are required to operate in the public interest and adhere to a "fairness doctrine," ensuring equal time for candidates [00:41:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">00:41:01</a>). Examples cited as violations include NBC bringing on KLA Harris for a favorable segment on *Saturday Night Live* without Donald Trump, and *60 Minutes* deceptively editing an interview with KLA Harris [00:41:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">00:41:23</a>).

## Influence of Advertisers on Media Narratives
A significant concern raised is the [[impact_of_corporate_decisions_on_media_narratives | impact of corporate decisions on media narratives]], particularly concerning pharmaceutical advertising.

*   **Pharma Advertising** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>: There's an argument that allowing pharmaceutical advertisements on TV networks serves primarily to "buy favorable coverage" rather than directly influencing consumers, as prescriptions are required [00:45:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">00:45:27</a>).
    *   Examples of alleged influence include stories critical of Pharma companies being "spiked" due to their status as major advertisers [00:45:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">00:45:42</a>).
    *   The practice is seen as corrupt and leading to self-censorship within news outlets, where certain stories are avoided to maintain advertising revenue [00:53:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">00:53:13</a>).
*   **Proposed Ban on Pharma Ads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>: Bobby Kennedy's potential nomination to HHS suggests a move to end Pharma advertising on broadcast stations [00:40:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">00:40:20</a>). This could lead to a significant revenue loss for news networks [00:43:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">00:43:04</a>). Most Western countries prohibit Pharma advertising on networks [00:44:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">00:44:38</a>).
    *   One argument against a ban is that it restricts free speech and limits awareness of new, beneficial drugs [00:45:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">00:45:11</a>), citing examples like new multiple sclerosis therapies [00:49:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">00:49:57</a>).
    *   A counter-argument suggests that the high cost of drugs, driven by government-funded insurance programs and middlemen, creates the incentive for this large advertising spend, contributing to a "regulatory captured Market" [00:51:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">00:51:25</a>).

### Shift in [[the_state_of_independent_media_and_broadcasting | Media Landscape]]
Legacy media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are experiencing significant challenges.

*   **Ratings Decline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>: MSNBC's ratings have reportedly dropped 50% since the election, suggesting a loss of credibility with their audience [00:43:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">00:43:36</a>).
*   **Audience Migration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>: Consumers are increasingly moving away from cable news and [[mainstream_media_and_its_influence_on_politics | Legacy Media]] towards [[the_state_of_independent_media_and_broadcasting | independent media]] and news sources due to a lack of trust [00:48:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">00:48:00</a>). This "market correction" is seen by some as reducing the need for government intervention in advertising [00:47:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">00:47:53</a>).

## Regulation and Accountability
The discussion extends to how regulatory bodies and new administrations might impact media practices. This relates to [[the_dynamics_and_challenges_of_media_bias_and_journalism_activism | the dynamics and challenges of media bias and journalism activism]].

*   **Big Tech and Censorship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>: There's a view that major tech companies that host social media platforms, like Google and Facebook (Meta), need to be held accountable for past "deplatforming and censorship" [00:33:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">00:33:11</a>).
    *   Meta (Facebook) is noted for regretting its compliance with censorship requests from the Biden Administration, particularly regarding the Hunter Biden story in 2020, which was deemed "election interference" [00:38:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">00:38:58</a>).
    *   Congressional investigation into the involvement of the intelligence community and the "Deep State" in censorship requests, as revealed by the "Twitter files," is advocated [00:39:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">00:39:35</a>).
*   **Anti-Competitive Practices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>: Some argue that Big Tech companies (Amazon, Apple, Google) have had a "free ride" and need continued pressure to prevent anti-competitive tactics [00:36:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">00:36:52</a>). Google is specifically mentioned as a candidate for being broken up due to its perceived monopolies in search, advertising, and YouTube [00:37:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">00:37:46</a>).
*   **Trump Administration Stance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>: The Trump administration is expected to end the "era of deceleration of regulatory capture and lawfare," aiming for a more vibrant economy [00:34:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">00:34:02</a>). There's also speculation that a new administration might be willing to address the "deplatforming and censorship" issues of Big Tech as a form of "pound of flesh" [00:33:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">00:33:11</a>).

> [!note] Political Retribution Allegations
> The FBI raid on PolyMarket CEO Shane Copelan's home, shortly after the election, was labeled as "political retribution by the outgoing Administration" for the platform's accurate presidential election predictions [00:59:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">00:59:16</a>). While theories about illegal wagering or wash trading exist, the timing of the raid (after the election was resolved) fueled speculation of political motivation to avoid appearing to interfere with the election outcome [01:00:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">01:00:41</a>).

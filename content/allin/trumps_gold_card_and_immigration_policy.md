Recent discussions within the "All-In Podcast" have touched upon [[us_immigration_policy_and_skilled_workforce | Trump's proposed "Golden Visa" or "Gold Card"]] and its potential impact on [[impact_of_immigration_policies | US immigration policy]] and the economy.

## The "Gold Card" Proposal

The proposal, put forth by [[trumps_cabinet | Trump]] and Lutnick, suggests selling green cards for $5 million, granting permanent residency in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This new program would replace the existing EB-5 visa program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. A key feature of Trump's proposal is that holders of this "Gold Card" would not have to pay tax on foreign assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. This is seen as significantly better than a traditional green card, which typically taxes global income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.

Chamath initially suggested a similar idea six months prior, proposing to sell citizenship for $500,000, to which Trump "added a zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. The proposal has been described as "incredible" and "fan freaking tastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

### Potential Adoption and Impact

A PolyMarket prediction market for the end of 2025 indicates that the most probable outcome (29% probability) is between 2,500 and 5,000 "Gold Cards" being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>. Chamath suggested that companies like Apple, Meta, and Microsoft might collectively buy 1,000 to 10,000 of these visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. If these visas could be swapped between individuals (like a "season pass"), they would be "incredible for recruiting talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>.

The discussion also pondered the number of potential buyers:
*   The estimated number of billionaires globally is 4,000-5,000, potentially 10,000-15,000 including "hidden" billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   There are approximately 28,000 individuals worldwide with a net worth over $100 million, with 17,000 of those outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.
*   It was posited that individuals with $20 million in net worth from countries like Venezuela or the Middle East would spend $5 million to get into the US, especially if they could make twice as much money living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>.
*   One perspective suggests that if vetting processes (like KYC/AML laws) are circumvented, millions of these visas could be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. However, another view limits potential buyers to a maximum of 10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>.

### Concerns and Challenges

A significant concern raised is the potential for "gray money" from around the world to enter the US system if robust vetting processes are not in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. There's skepticism about how wealth held in cash or gold could be legitimately brought into the US financial system if strict KYC/AML laws are applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.

## Broader [[immigration_policy_and_border_security_challenges | Immigration Policy and Border Security]] Context

In related discussions, [[border_control_and_immigration_policy | unemployment rates]] are noted at historic lows, close to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. However, promised deportations have been modest, ranging from 500 to 1,000 people per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. To significantly impact unemployment, deportations would need to reach 2,000 to 3,000 people per day, leading to "low millions" being deported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. The connection between [[Trumps economic and tariff strategies | Trump's economic and tariff strategies]], including tariffs and slowing immigration, and potential austerity is highlighted as contributing to a negative outlook on economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, has significantly increased his involvement at the company, focusing intently on the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Brin, who registered Google as a website on September 15, 1997, with the aim of finding information on the web more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, had previously taken a backseat in recent years to other Google leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His renewed dedication comes at a time when [[AI and its impact on Googles business model | AI is actively changing the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Motivation and Enthusiasm for AI

Brin expresses profound excitement about the progress in AI, stating he has "never seen anything as exciting as all of the AI progress that's happened the last few years" as a computer scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. He notes that AI was a mere "footnote" in curriculum during his grad school days in the '90s, with neural networks being a "discarded approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The recent breakthrough, driven by "a little bit more compute, a little more data, a few clever algorithms," has been "mindblowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He feels "doubly wowed" that computers can achieve what they now can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, motivating him to re-engage with the technical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Day-to-Day Involvement and Examples

Brin spends "pretty much every day" at Google working on AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. He views AI as affecting "so many different elements of day-to-day life," going beyond just search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. He highlights programming as an example, where writing code from scratch feels "really hard" compared to asking AI to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

He personally uses [[Googles AI Advancements and Search Redesign | AI tools for coding]], such as having an AI model write code to generate and solve Sudoku puzzles, which impressed engineers who don't use AI for coding as much as he believes they should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Perspectives on AI Model Development and Compute

### Unified vs. Specialized Models
Brin notes that historically, different AI techniques were used for different problems (e.g., chess AI vs. image generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. While specific AI models still excel in niche areas, such as the formal theorem proving model used in the International Math Olympiad (which achieved a silver medal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, he believes the trend is towards "a more unified model" with "shared architectures and ultimately even shared models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, though he wouldn't call it a "god model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Compute Requirements and Investment
Developing these large models requires significant compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. While he's cautious about blindly extrapolating compute needs to extreme levels, he acknowledges that there's "a huge amount of demand" for computing resources like TPUs and GPUs from both internal teams and cloud customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Google is building out compute as quickly as possible, sometimes needing to "turn down customers" due to lack of availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. He also points out that algorithmic improvements are potentially "outpacing the increased compute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## AI Applications: Successes and Challenges

### Biology
Brin identifies biology as an area of "greatest success," citing AlphaFold, which is widely used by biologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Robotics
In robotics, Brin describes it as being in a "wow stage," where general-purpose language models can make robots perform impressive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. However, he notes that it's "not for the most part yet at the level of robustness that would make it like day-to-day useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He admits that Google's previous ventures into robotics were "a little too early" without the modern AI technology, leading to investments that didn't yield practical results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Shifting Google's Culture on AI Deployment

Brin is a proponent of a more aggressive deployment strategy for AI, even if it means potential "embarrassments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. He acknowledges a historical "timidity" at Google, particularly after they "invented" the Transformer paper (a foundational AI model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, yet were "too timid to deploy them" due to concerns about mistakes or "embarrassing things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Brin believes that despite potential flaws, AI's "incredibly powerful" capability to help users achieve things they never would have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, such as his kid programming complicated things with AI, makes it "magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. He advocates for releasing AI tools, communicating their current limitations, and allowing people to experiment and find new uses, rather than keeping the technology "close to the chest and hidden until it's perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. This approach encourages Google to push the envelope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## AI Competition and Value for Humanity

Addressing the perception of an [[AI competition and Googles strategy in the AI space | AI race among tech giants]], Brin states that while competition is "very helpful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, there's "tremendous value to humanity" in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. He acknowledges that Google has made significant progress, catching up since [[AI search wars between Google and Microsoft | ChatGPT launched]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. He compares the impact of AI to the internet's early days, noting the immense gain in capability across the world through new AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

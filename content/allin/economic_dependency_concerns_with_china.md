The United States faces a significant challenge due to its inability to produce what it needs domestically, leading to a reliance on foreign entities whose geopolitical views can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To address this, there's a need to measure and protect four critical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Critical Areas of Dependency

### Technology
This category includes both chips and the enabling technology for [[impact_of_foreign_investments_in_china_and_ai | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is essential to establish a robust, largely American supply chain for these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Energy
The United States currently lacks the capability to rapidly produce the energy it requires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Furthermore, critical supply chains, such as those for photovoltaics, are vulnerable to being cut off by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Critical Material Inputs
These materials are crucial for driving future material science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. There is a specific problem related to [[dependence_on_critical_materials_and_rare_earths | critical minerals and rare earths]] and other material science inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Pharma APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients)
It is vital for the United States to have the capacity to not only manufacture but also design and produce pharmaceutical APIs, ensuring that American citizens can access necessary medications when they fall ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

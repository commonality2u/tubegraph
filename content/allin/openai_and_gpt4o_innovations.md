The [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] industrial complex has recently dominated discussions, particularly with [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI's]] launch of [[ChatGPT and AIs impact on various industries | ChatGPT]] 4o (Omni) on a Monday. This release occurred just three days after Sam Altman, CEO of [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]], appeared on the All-In Podcast, leading to a discussion about a potential strategic error in not postponing his appearance until after the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Altman had originally intended to discuss upcoming announcements but they were delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

## GPT-4o: Omni-Modal Capabilities

[[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]] launched GPT-4o, where the "O" stands for Omni, indicating its omni-channel or omnivore capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>. This new model is faster, cheaper, and offers significant improvements in user interface and experience (UI/UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. It can process and respond to audio, text, images, and even desktop and video inputs from a camera, functioning as a 360-degree [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.

Key innovations highlighted include:
*   **Real-time Conversational Interaction** The model addresses the "cold boot" problem seen with tools like Siri, where there's a delay or interruption when users speak over each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. GPT-4o demonstrates much smoother interaction, as shown in examples of counting exercises (speeding up/slowing down) and real-time translation between English and Italian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Learning and Personal Coaching** A desktop and iOS application of GPT-4o can observe a user's screen or activity. An example showed Sal Khan from Khan Academy using the app to tutor his son in math, providing nudges and questions without directly giving answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. The app acts as a personal coach, observing the user's attempts to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. It can also participate in Zoom calls and explain charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.

## Evolution in Model Architecture

Freeberg noted that GPT-4o represents an evolution in model architecture, moving away from large, bulky models released quarterly that are expensive to rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. Instead, it leverages a "system of models" â€“ a multimodal system where several smaller models work together, or are linked, to respond to inputs and generate outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. These individual models can be continuously tuned and updated, making updates more continuous rather than large, infrequent releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>.

### Performance and Benchmarking

Initial criticisms of performance degradation with GPT-4o were countered by independent assessments. Stanford University runs a "massive multitask language understanding assessment" that frequently publishes model performance scorecards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. This scorecard shows that GPT-4o actually outperforms GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. While it still underperforms Claude 3 Opus on these specific charts, it dispels the narrative that performance was sacrificed for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. GPT-4o is significantly faster than its predecessor, GPT-4 Turbo, with reported speeds twice as fast and feeling 10 times faster in practical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.

## Consumer Growth and Business Model Shift

Despite [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI's]] innovations, web visits for [[ChatGPT and AIs impact on various industries | ChatGPT]] have plateaued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. This suggests that initial "lookie-loos" have moved on, indicating a need for more concrete use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>. Sam Altman noted that with new model releases, older versions tend to become free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. New models are also becoming significantly more efficient and cheaper, with costs decreasing by about 90% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.

It is speculated that [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]] may eventually offer basic services for free or close to free, potentially charging only for multiplayer or advanced versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. The long-term business model might shift away from B2C subscriptions (which tend to have high churn and limited expansion) towards a B2B direction, monetizing applications built on top of their models via API usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of ChatGPT and AI on various industries | Impact of AI on Industries and Startups]]

The rapid pace of [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] innovation, particularly with models like GPT-4o, has significant implications for existing companies and startups:

*   **Obsolescence of Product Roadmaps:** Startups focused on areas like virtual customer support agents, which spent years making agents more conversational, may find their product roadmaps suddenly obsolete as core capabilities are integrated directly into foundational [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>.
*   **Model Innovation vs. Product Innovation:** A critical challenge for developers is understanding where core model innovation ends and their own product innovation begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. Building features that foundational models will soon obsolete is a risk.
*   **Shift Towards Open Source:** There's a strong incentive for companies to push operationally necessary, but not core, solutions into open source. This allows the community to maintain and improve them, freeing companies from ongoing investment and enabling easier switching between different [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] models (e.g., [[OpenAI and AI advancements | GPT-4o]] to Claude to [[Metas open source AI strategy | Llama]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>. This mirrors initiatives like Facebook's Open Compute Project, which open-sourced data center hardware designs, dramatically reducing costs and fostering an open platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>.
*   **Deflationary Tailwinds:** [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] is expected to be a massive deflationary tailwind. The declining cost of compute, coupled with the ability to automate and delegate tasks (the "80/90 rule" - automate, deprecate, delegate), will lead to lower operating expenses for companies and potentially smaller company sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

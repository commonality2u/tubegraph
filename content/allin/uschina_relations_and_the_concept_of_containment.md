From: [[allin]] <br/> 

The discussion on [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | US-China relations]] features two prominent thinkers on [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | foreign policy]]: Professor John Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and Professor Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Their perspectives, while sometimes converging on outcomes, diverge significantly on the underlying motivations and proposed solutions for [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | US-China relations]].

## The "Deep State" and US Foreign Policy

Both Mearsheimer and Sachs describe a consistent, entrenched approach to [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | US foreign policy]] across administrations, which they refer to as the "deep state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Jeffrey Sachs suggests there is "one deep State party" that includes figures like Dick Cheney, Kamala Harris, and Victoria Nuland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He highlights Victoria Nuland's presence in multiple administrations over 30 years, influencing policies toward Russia and orchestrating a coup in Ukraine in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
John Mearsheimer refers to Republicans and Democrats as "Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum," seeing little difference in their [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. He notes that Donald Trump attempted to challenge this "deep state" but largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Mearsheimer defines the "deep state" as the administrative state, comprising high-level bureaucrats in institutions like the Pentagon, State Department, and intelligence community, who have a vested interest in pursuing a particular [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | foreign policy]] favored by both major parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This state grew powerful after World War II due to the United States' global involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Jeffrey Sachs concurs, likening it to Russian President Vladimir Putin's experience with "men in dark suits" who explain "the way the world really is" to new presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. He asserts that this deeply entrenched [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | foreign policy]] has been consistently in place for 30 years, regardless of who is president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Underlying Logic: Maximizing Power and Liberal Hegemony
Both experts agree that the primary objective of [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | American foreign policy]] is to maximize global power, seeking to be a global hegemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. John Mearsheimer adds that the United States, as a "fundamentally liberal country," believes it has the "right, responsibility, and power to run around the world and remake the world in America's image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This liberal impulse, combined with power, has largely motivated US [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | foreign policy]] since the Cold War ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

However, Mearsheimer argues that imposing liberal democracy on other countries often backfires (e.g., Iraq, Afghanistan) and erodes liberalism domestically by building a "deep state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Sachs, on the other hand, believes the US government does not genuinely care about promoting liberal democracy in other places; rather, it seeks military bases and support for its own interests, especially [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | NATO enlargement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. He cites instances of US-backed coups and cynical justifications for interventions, such as the bombing of Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## [[USChina trade relations and history | US-China Relations]]: Threat or Opportunity?

The discussion specifically pivots to [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | US-China relations]] and the concept of containment.

### Mearsheimer's View: Containment is Necessary
John Mearsheimer advocates for **containing China** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. He believes China is a "peer competitor" and the "most serious threat" to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. He distinguishes containment from regime change, stating he is "not interested in trying to turn China into a democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

Mearsheimer's realist perspective prioritizes "security or survival" of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. In an "anarchic system" without a higher authority, states must be powerful to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. The US, as a regional hegemon in the Western Hemisphere, does not tolerate other regional hegemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. China's economic might is being translated into military power, and it aims to dominate Asia and push the US out of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Preventing China from becoming a regional hegemon is crucial to prevent it from "roaming" the world like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. This leads to intense security competition across all domains, including high-tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

### Sachs's View: China is Not a Threat, Current Policy is Misguided
Jeffrey Sachs strongly disagrees with the notion that China is a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. He describes China as a "market" with "great food, great culture, wonderful people, a civilization 10 times older than ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. From an [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | economic perspective]], a cold or hot conflict with China would "wreck California" and destroy the economy that has benefited significantly from China's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

Sachs believes the perception of conflict with China is due to the US pursuit of global hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. He argues that China is not a threat to US security due to geographical distance and nuclear deterrents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. He contends that the US should avoid provoking World War III over issues like Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>, which he calls the "stupidest thing for my grandchildren to die for imaginable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

### Economic Interdependence vs. Security Competition
The core difference between their views on [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | US-China relations]] lies in prioritizing prosperity versus security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
Sachs, as an economist, believes that [[uschina_trade_relations_and_rare_earth_dependencies | economics is not a zero-sum game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. He asserts that allowing China into the WTO enriched the US and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. He argues that [[economic_dependency_concerns_with_china | US policy to "decouple" from China]] is a deliberate strategy to contain China, which is not smart and will not solve American manufacturing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

Mearsheimer, a realist, prioritizes security and survival in an anarchic international system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. He believes that states must maximize power for their own survival, leading to an "intense security competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

### Risks of Containment and Regional Flashpoints
Sachs warns that the US approach, aiming for global hegemony, is "likely to get us all blown up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>, especially in the nuclear age. He highlights the current "direct war with Russia" as an "imbecilic" policy resulting from US meddling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. He believes the same will happen if the US continues its confrontational stance with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.

Mearsheimer identifies three main flashpoints in East Asia for [[chinataiwan_relations_and_global_economic_implications | US-China conflict]]: Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. He states that conflict is "most likely today" in the South China Sea, not Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. He agrees that nuclear war is a risk but believes security competition is "inevitable," though war *can* be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

Sachs suggests China's development of a Blue Water Navy is a reaction to US strategy of "choke points" against China in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Indian Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

### India's Role
Regarding India, Mearsheimer views it as an ally against China, part of the Quad alliance (Australia, Japan, US, India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. India's primary concern is China, especially on their shared border in the Himalayas and in the Indian Ocean, where China is developing power projection capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

Sachs, however, states that India is a "superpower" with its own distinctive interests and will not be an ally of the United States against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

### Economic Decoupling
The shift of iPhone production to India and Japan's funding for companies leaving China to Vietnam and India are seen as part of the "decoupling" from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Jeffrey Sachs clarifies that these are "United States deliberate policy to stop you from selling things to China and to stop China buying things from you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>, not self-inflicted wounds by China. He believes this strategy is "not smart" and will not solve American manufacturing jobs, only making things less efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

## Conclusion: Inevitable Tragedy or Prudence?

John Mearsheimer concludes that he is "in an iron cage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>, believing that the dynamics of [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | International politics]] make security competition "inevitable" due to the anarchic system and states' pursuit of power for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. While war can be avoided, as seen during the Cold War, he cannot guarantee it for the [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | US-China competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. He describes this as a "tragic aspect of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.

Jeffrey Sachs's counter-argument is that while Mearsheimer accurately describes current [[us_foreign_policy_and_global_relations | US foreign policy]], this "profoundly misguided approach" is likely to lead to nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. He advocates for "prudence" and understanding other states' perspectives to de-conflict and avoid catastrophic war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

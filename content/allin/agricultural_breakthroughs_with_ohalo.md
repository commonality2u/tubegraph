Ohalo has spent five years developing a new agricultural technology called "boosted breeding," which they are now publicly announcing as their patents begin to be published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. The company aims to radically transform crop yield, improve plant health and size, and ultimately impact productivity, farmer revenue, food costs, and sustainability globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

## Boosted Breeding Technology
The core theory behind boosted breeding is to alter plant reproduction so that parent plants pass 100% of their genes to their offspring, rather than the typical 50% from each parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. This means the offspring inherit all genes from both the mother and the father, resulting in double the DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

Currently, traditional plant breeding can take decades to combine desirable traits, like disease resistance and drought resistance, into a single plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. Ohalo's method involves applying specific proteins to parent plants to "switch off" the reproductive circuits that normally cause gene splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.

The process of having double the chromosomes is called polyploidy, which naturally occurs in some species like wheat (hexaploid, six sets), potatoes (tetraploid, four sets), and strawberries (octoploid, eight sets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. This technology is applicable only to plants, not animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.

The more beneficial genes a plant has, the more tools it has to survive and thrive in various conditions, leading to healthier, bigger plants with greater yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

### Results and Examples
Ohalo has collected data showing significant yield gains, ranging from 50% to 100% or even more in some plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

*   **_Arabidopsis_**: Experiments with *Arabidopsis*, a common research weed, showed that boosted offspring were much larger, healthier, and had bigger leaves than their parent plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Seed production also increased by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Potatoes**: Potato, the third-largest source of calories globally, has shown "crazy results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
    *   Two parent potatoes, one yielding 33 grams and the other 9 grams, produced a boosted offspring yielding 682 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.
    *   The boosted potato was much larger than its parents and even a typical market variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
    *   The primary improvement is in yield (number of potatoes per acre) rather than individual potato size, leading to less water and land use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
    *   Ohalo's system enables the creation of "perfect seed" for potatoes, which currently lack a significant seed industry because conventional potato seeds are genetically different from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. Planting seed saves farmers about 20% in revenue, reduces disease risk, and makes management easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.
    *   This technology is being applied to major potato lines, including russet varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   **Corn**: Ohalo has also achieved bigger corn kernels and cobs, which has been published in their patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

## Broader Implications
The ability to significantly increase yield with less water, land, and energy, while potentially reducing fertilizer use per pound produced, will have a massive impact on the [[Innovation and challenges in the future of food | future of food]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. It also opens up the possibility of adapting crops to new environments where they currently cannot grow, helping to address global malnutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

Ohalo uses [[AI advancements and the economic impact | quantitative genomics]] and AI models to predict which plant crosses will yield the best growth or health outcomes, from hundreds of thousands or millions of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.

## Business Model and Investment
Ohalo is already revenue-generating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. Their business model involves partnering with existing seed businesses and genetics companies to improve their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. In markets like potato, where a seed industry doesn't exist, they are building their own business to produce and sell potato seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

The company has invested over $50 million to date, operating in stealth for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. While they have filed for IP protection, their competitive advantage is more reliant on "trade secrets" and building a continuous "moat" by constantly improving their varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

## Key Personnel
Jud Ward, Ohalo's co-founder and CTO, conceived the idea of boosted breeding years ago. Ward previously ran molecular breeding at Driscoll's, and many former Driscoll's employees now work at Ohalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

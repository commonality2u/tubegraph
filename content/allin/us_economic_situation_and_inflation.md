The [[the_current_state_of_the_us_economy_and_federal_reserve_policies | current state of the US economy]] is being assessed, with key indicators pointing towards a potential soft landing, though some analysts raise concerns about a deeper contraction [04:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>.

## Soft Landing Prospects

Recent economic data suggests a soft landing may be underway [06:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29">[06:29]</a>:
*   **Stock Market** - Stocks continue to surge, hitting records, with the S&P 500 up 26% since the previous year, largely due to the performance of tech giants like Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft [04:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>, [06:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35">[06:35]</a>.
*   **Job Market** - Job growth appears to have slowed, and unemployment is rising [04:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>. In June, unemployment reached 4.1%, the highest since 2021 and an uptick from the historic low of 3.4% in April 2023 [06:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a>. This cooling of the job market was a major goal for the Federal Reserve [04:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>.
*   **Stimulus Savings** - Pandemic-era stimulus savings are largely depleted [04:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>.

Despite these positive signs, some analysts question whether the market's current highs, driven by a few large companies, truly reflect broad-based demand, and ponder the possibility of a deeper economic contraction or a "mini-recession" in the coming quarters [07:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07">[07:07]</a>, [07:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20">[07:20]</a>.

## [[macroeconomic_discussion_on_inflation_and_federal_reserve_policy | Inflation]] Trends

Consumer Price Index (CPI) data shows a significant drop:
*   **Recent CPI Print** - CPI came in at 3.0%, cooler than the 3.1% economists expected [04:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>.
*   **Month-on-Month Decrease** - CPI fell 10 basis points month-on-month, marking the first decrease since May 2020 [05:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>.
*   **Lowest in Three Years** - This is the lowest CPI reading in three years [05:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28">[05:28]</a>.

The contraction in [[macroeconomic_discussion_on_inflation_and_federal_reserve_policy | inflation]] is attributed to a combination of sustained high interest rates and rising unemployment [07:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37">[07:37]</a>. However, [[macroeconomic_discussion_on_inflation_and_federal_reserve_policy | inflation]] remains persistently high at 3% [12:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40">[12:40]</a>.

### Global and Domestic Factors Affecting Inflation
[[US economy and global influence | Global inflation]] also plays a significant role, as US companies dependent on international labor and materials have raised prices [10:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a>, [18:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16">[18:16]</a>. Grocery prices, for instance, are up over 30% since COVID [18:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03">[18:03]</a>.

## Federal Reserve Policy and Interest Rates
The [[the_current_state_of_the_us_economy_and_federal_reserve_policies | Federal Reserve]] (the Fed) has been criticized for reacting too slowly to inflation, continuing quantitative easing (QE) for six months after high inflation prints emerged [12:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07">[12:07]</a>. Since then, the Fed has aggressively increased rates to combat inflation [12:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33">[12:33]</a>.

### Interest Rate Outlook
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the Fed doesn't need to see 2% inflation to start rate cuts [05:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>. Prediction markets now show an 89% chance of at least one rate cut by September, up from 73% previously [05:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a>, [05:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52">[05:52]</a>.

### The 2% Inflation Target Debate
There is a growing discussion in Washington, D.C., about whether the Fed should reset its inflation target from 2% to 3% [09:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12">[09:12]</a>. This 2% target was originally proposed by Roger Douglas, the former Finance Minister of New Zealand, based on what he considered a "healthy" rate [10:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50">[10:50]</a>.

Some argue that given the massive stimulus injected into the economy during COVID, it could take a decade to normalize, making a return to 2% inflation unlikely in the current era [09:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42">[09:42]</a>. If 3% becomes the "new normal," it implies permanently higher interest rates, as the Fed typically aims for a return above the inflation rate [12:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47">[12:47]</a>. For example, a 2% real return on a 3% inflation rate would require a 5% interest rate, compared to 4% if inflation were 2% [13:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08">[13:08]</a>. Permanently higher interest rates could act as a drag on the [[us_economy_and_interest_rate_impacts | US economy and investment]] by increasing hurdle rates for risk-taking [13:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27">[13:27]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and Predictions
The P/E ratio on the S&P 500 has seen a significant increase, with a large portion attributed to the top seven tech companies [08:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44">[08:44]</a>, [08:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51">[08:51]</a>. Market makers have already priced in the expected rate cuts [08:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58">[08:58]</a>. The spread between the S&P 500 Index and an equal-weighted index (where all 500 companies have equal weight) is currently at its most extreme since March 2000, just before the dot-com bust, suggesting a potential "enormous hype cycle" that may need to contract [18:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36">[18:36]</a>, [19:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01">[19:01]</a>.

There is significant uncertainty in the [[the_economic_outlook_and_recession_predictions | economic outlook]], with investors facing challenges in valuation given unclear risk-free rates of return [19:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39">[19:39]</a>, [20:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29">[20:29]</a>. A "reset" of rates or equity risk premium may be needed to stimulate the economy [20:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02">[20:02]</a>.

## Partisan Perception of the Economy
Economic perception in the US is often influenced by partisanship. A "partisan economic perception" phenomenon shows that Democrats and Republicans view the economy very differently depending on which party controls the White House [14:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35">[14:35]</a>. This divergence in perception tightens during major crises like the dot-com crash, the Great Financial Crisis, and the pandemic [16:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09">[16:09]</a>, [16:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19">[16:19]</a>.

This explains much of the tension in the country, as people cannot agree on the state of the economy due to their partisan lenses [16:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25">[16:25]</a>, [16:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33">[16:33]</a>. The perception of progression is often decoupled from actual economic progression, influenced by political leaders' popularization of their actions [17:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42">[17:42]</a>, [17:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46">[17:46]</a>.

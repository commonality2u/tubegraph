The potential for conflict between China and Taiwan carries significant global economic implications, particularly concerning the existing deep economic ties between the [[us_economy_and_global_influence | United States]] and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This potential conflict is seen as a major global risk, following regional conflicts like those in Ukraine and Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

## US Policy on Taiwan
The current [[US  China relations and business impact | US policy]] regarding Taiwan is one of strategic ambiguity, where the [[US  China relations and business impact | US]] does not explicitly state its intentions if China were to invade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. This approach is considered to have the "virtue of being correct" and potentially the "best" policy, as any precise declaration could "lead to war right away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. While avoiding World War III is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, it would be "quite catastrophic" if Taiwan were taken over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

## Economic Decoupling
A potential military conflict between China and Taiwan is predicted to trigger a severe economic decoupling between the [[us_economy_and_global_influence | US]] and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. This is likened to "100 pipelines" blowing up, analogous to the Nord Stream pipeline between Russia and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. The intuition is that this decoupling is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

### Impact on Businesses
Businesses are deeply "coupled" to China through various means, including direct investment, competition within China, and establishing factories for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.
*   **Domestic Competition:** Investing in companies that compete domestically within China is viewed as "virtually impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **Investing in Chinese Businesses:** This is considered "quite tricky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing for Export:** Many businesses have set up factories in China for export to the West, leveraging significant labor cost arbitrage, with workers earning $1.50-$2 an hour and living in crowded dorms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Shifting manufacturing, such as iPhone factories, to the [[us_economy_and_global_influence | United States]] is "not that straightforward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

### Decoupling Example: TikTok
The [[uschina_relations_and_tiktok_debate | TikTok]] scenario illustrates the risk: the [[TikTok | TikTok]] CEO was advised to completely decouple the business from ByteDance and China by moving computers and people out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This was because [[TikTok | TikTok]] was predicted to be banned within 24 hours of a Taiwan invasion, destroying 100% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. The CEO's belief that companies could sell to both sides in a conflict was dismissed as naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

The advice given was for every industry leader to consider [[uschina_economic_relations_and_manufacturing_reshoring | decoupling from China]], describing continued engagement as "picking up nickels in front of a freight train" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

### Economic Consequences of Decoupling
The decoupling process is expected to be "pretty inflationary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. However, it might not be as inflationary as some models suggest, as trade is often modeled between two countries, not considering third-party options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. Instead of reshoring manufacturing to the [[us_economy_and_global_influence | US]], which would be "insanely expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>, production could shift to other countries like Vietnam or Mexico, where incomes are lower than in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. This represents a "negative sum trade policy" that would be somewhat detrimental to the [[us_economy_and_global_influence | US]], "extremely bad for China," and beneficial for countries like Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Conflict
Avoiding a conflict is not solely up to the [[us_economy_and_global_influence | US]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. A key challenge is China's deep-seated belief in a historical conflict, often framed by the "Thucydides Trap" â€” a rising power clashing with an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. To avoid conflict, there must be an admission that China views conflict as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. Simply promoting "happy talk" is seen as a "recipe for war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. While engagement with adversaries is generally a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>, the current [[US  China relations and business impact | US]] administration's inability to maintain back-channel communication with countries like Russia is seen as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

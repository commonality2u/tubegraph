The 2024 United States election demonstrated a significant [[influence_of_media_and_public_figures_on_elections | shift]] in how political messages are conveyed and received, with alternative media playing a crucial role [00:12:23]. This election's outcome, particularly Donald Trump's victory, highlighted the diminished influence of traditional [[mainstream_media_and_its_influence_on_politics | Legacy Media]] and the rising power of direct-to-audience platforms [00:36:36].

## Alternative Media's Role in Trump's Campaign
The use of alternative media, such as long-form [[podcast_influence_on_elections | podcasts]], was a "major part of Trump's strategy" [00:13:01]. Platforms like *The All-In Pod*, Joe Rogan, and Lex Fridman allowed candidates, especially on the Republican side, to communicate directly with audiences, bypassing traditional reporters and news outlets [00:12:31]. This direct communication was credited with making Trump's message "more clearly" understood by voters [00:12:25].

The Trump campaign notably "crushed it on podcast with JD Vance," utilizing these platforms to deliver their message effectively [00:14:11]. This contrasted sharply with the Democratic approach, which "didn't get" the importance of engaging audiences where they are, preferring paid media [00:13:07], [00:30:06].

## Decline of Legacy Media's Influence
Speakers in the discussion asserted that the "Legacy Media spell is broken" and their credibility has been "destroyed" [00:36:36]. Despite a "massive advantage on what you would call the Legacy Media side" and what was described as a "trillion dollar propaganda machine" attempting to "vilify Donald Trump" and "prop up" his opposition, their efforts "blew up in their faces" [00:35:58], [00:36:19], [00:20:00]. This repudiation of traditional media was deemed "one of the most important results of this election" [00:36:44].

One specific example cited was the media's alleged "collusion" and "lying" about Trump's statements regarding Charlottesville, which initially angered some voters but was later seen as a "complete lie" when full footage was reviewed [00:43:45], [00:44:17]. This perceived dishonesty contributed to a broader public skepticism of traditional news sources [00:20:10].

## Earned Media vs. Paid Media
The discussion highlighted the strategic difference between "earned media" and "paid media" [00:30:06]. While the Democratic campaign spent nearly $900 million and Super PACs spent $1.4 billion on paid advertising, the Trump campaign spent significantly less [00:28:37]. The success of Trump's campaign was partly attributed to its ability to generate "earned media" through appearances on popular podcasts and direct engagement, effectively bypassing the need for extensive paid advertising [00:30:06], [00:37:06].

Kamala Harris's inability to engage with "earned media" platforms like Joe Rogan was cited as a significant campaign weakness, as it was believed such appearances would have been "embarrassing" due to her communication style [00:31:01].

## Impact on Voter Demographics
Alternative media and free speech platforms like X (formerly Twitter) were seen as "absolutely necessary enablers" for Trump's victory [00:37:06]. There is speculation about how Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and other podcasts influenced younger men, potentially creating a "sustainable change" in voting patterns among this demographic [00:40:02].

This reflects a shift where savvy use of new media platforms can outperform traditional campaign spending and media strategies, contributing to the evolving [[current_political_climate_and_the_impact_on_elections | political dynamics]] and [[election_results_and_political_analysis | outcomes]] in [[us_elections_and_political_dynamics | US elections]]. The outcome of this election underscores a growing public distrust of traditional media and a willingness to seek information from alternative sources, marking a new era in [[influence_of_media_and_public_figures_on_elections | media's influence on elections]].

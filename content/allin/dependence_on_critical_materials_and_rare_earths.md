The United States faces a significant challenge that is described as being "much bigger than [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | China]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This challenge stems from a position where the U.S. is "not in a position to take care of what we need" and depends on entities whose views of the United States "can change in real time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. To address this, there is a need to measure and protect four critical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Four Critical Areas for Protection

The critical areas identified for protection and robust supply chains include:

1.  **Technology:** This encompasses chips and enabling technology related to artificial intelligence, requiring a "robust largely American supply chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
2.  **Energy:** The U.S. lacks the capability to quickly produce the necessary energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. There are [[united_states_energy_supply_chain_challenges | critical supply chains]] in photovoltaics that can be shut off by [[us__china_relations_and_business_impact | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
3.  **Critical Material Inputs:** These are essential materials that drive the material science of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Specifically, there is a "critical minerals and rare earths and material science input problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
4.  **Pharma APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients):** Ensuring the ability to not just manufacture but also design APIs so that American citizens can access necessary medications when sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

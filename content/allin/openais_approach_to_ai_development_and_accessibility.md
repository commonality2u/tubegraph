[[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] was co-founded by Sam Altman in 2016 with the mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Altman emphasizes that while many are afraid of AGI, its development is "unavoidable" and will be "tremendously beneficial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.

## Model Development and Release Strategy

[[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] takes its time with major model releases, such as GPT-5, and may release them in different ways than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:59">[02:45:59]</a>. There is a possibility that future models might not even follow a sequential numbering like GPT-5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:30">[03:01:30]</a>. Altman suggests that a more continuous improvement model, where the entire AI system constantly gets better, is a better technological direction and easier for society to adapt to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>. This could involve continuous retraining or ongoing training of models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:51">[03:59:51]</a>.

### Accessibility and Cost
A core part of [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]]'s mission is to make advanced AI technology widely available, including to free users, despite the significant expense involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:19">[04:30:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:19">[05:04:19]</a>. [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] aims to cut latency and costs "really, really dramatically" for their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:52">[06:30:52]</a>. Altman believes that the science behind AI is still early, and engineering advancements will lead to "intelligence too cheap to meter and so fast that it feels instantaneous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:58">[06:42:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:09">[06:50:09]</a>.

### [[ai_open_source_versus_closed_source_models | Open Source versus Closed Source]]
While [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] has [[open_source_versus_closed_source_in_ai_development | open-sourced]] some of its technology and plans to do more in the future, its primary mission is to build towards AGI and broadly distribute its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:48">[07:14:48]</a>. Altman sees great roles for both [[ai_open_source_versus_closed_source_models | open-source]] and closed-source approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:04">[07:10:04]</a>. He is particularly interested in an [[ai_open_source_versus_closed_source_models | open-source]] model that can run effectively on a phone, even if the technology isn't fully there yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:04">[07:41:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:30">[07:51:30]</a>.

The initial goal of [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] was that AI was "too important for any one company to own it" and needed to be [[open_source_versus_closed_source_in_ai_development | open]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:04">[09:34:04]</a>. The shift to a more closed approach for frontier models was partly driven by the desire to put technology directly into people's hands, as seen with the launch of ChatGPT, which showed the world the importance and reality of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:03">[10:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:44">[10:28:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Open vs. Closed Decision
> The decision to keep certain models closed source is seen as a strategic choice for [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] to focus on building a "useful intelligence layer" rather than just the "smartest set of Weights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:50">[08:52:50]</a>. Altman believes [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] can stay "pretty far ahead" on this front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:44">[09:08:44]</a>.

Chamath Palihapitiya notes that while [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]]'s models might not be [[open_source_versus_closed_source_in_ai_development | open source]], the business model might shift towards charging for the infrastructure and scaffolding around the models, similar to how [[open_source_versus_closed_source_in_ai_development | open-source]] software runs on cloud platforms like AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

### Infrastructure and Hardware
[[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development_and_deployment | AI development]] is currently constrained by NVIDIA's throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:19">[13:58:19]</a>. To achieve cheaper and faster compute, [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] anticipates huge algorithmic gains, which can effectively double compute efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:20">[14:22:20]</a>. The entire supply chain for [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development_and_deployment | AI development]] is complex, involving logic Fab capacity, HBM manufacturing, data center construction and wiring, and energy supply, which is a "huge bottleneck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:04">[14:47:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:27">[15:00:27]</a>. Altman expressed interest in [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development_and_deployment | AI chip projects]], though he stated the reported $7 trillion figure was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:13">[01:53:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. He believes the world needs "a lot more [[ai_as_a_computing_platform_and_its_potential_disruption | AI infrastructure]]" than currently planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

## User Interaction and Future Interfaces

[[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]]'s goal is to create a "useful intelligence layer" for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Altman is highly interested in new computing form factors enabled by [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI advancements]], though he acknowledges the high bar set by the iPhone, which he considers "the greatest piece of technology Humanity has ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:23">[01:50:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

He envisions an "always on, super low friction thing" that acts as the "world's greatest assistant," with as much context as possible, constantly helping and making the user better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:39">[01:58:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This assistant would be a "separate entity," like a "great senior employee" rather than an "extension of myself" or a "sycophant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:42">[02:21:42]</a>. It would be able to reason, push back, and have a competent relationship with the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:26">[02:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

Voice interaction is seen as a "hint to whatever the next thing is" for computer usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. However, Altman believes visual user interfaces are still essential for many tasks, and a purely voice-only world is hard to imagine for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>. The goal is to design a world "equally usable by humans and by AIs," with smooth handoffs and opportunities for human feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>. This includes multimodal capabilities like computer vision, enabling [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] to understand and interact with the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

## Areas of Impact and Application

ChatGPT has already become a household name and is having a "massive impact on how we work and how work is getting done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:28">[02:01:28]</a>. It was reportedly the fastest product to hit 100 million users in history, achieving this in just two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>. [[OpenAIs revenue growth and business model | OpenAI]] reportedly hit $2 billion in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">[02:18:04]</a>.

Altman highlights several promising applications and areas of impact:
*   **AI Tutor:** Making an effective [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] tutor that could "reinvent" how people learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a>.
*   **Coding:** Tools like Devin and similar developments are seen as a "super cool vision of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Believes healthcare "should be pretty transformed by this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>.
*   **Scientific Discovery:** Personally most excited about [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] leading to "faster and better scientific discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:08">[02:34:08]</a>. He views models with "reasoning" capabilities as crucial for connecting to scientific simulators and addressing complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
    *   While specialized models like AlphaFold are built specifically for tasks like protein modeling, Altman's intuition is that generalizable reasoning will eventually allow a single large model to address new problem domains rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:58">[03:11:58]</a>.
*   **Video Generation:** [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]]'s Sora model for video generation is a customized model for video, not starting from a language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Societal and Ethical Considerations

### Jobs and Economic Models
Anticipating significant changes to society, jobs, and the economy due to [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]], Altman has explored new societal arrangements like Universal Basic Income (UBI) through studies conducted since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. He believes giving people money, rather than traditional government assistance programs, can solve problems and provide a "better Horizon with which to help themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

He now wonders if the future might lean more towards "Universal Basic Compute" (UBC) than UBI, where individuals receive a "slice of GPT-7 compute" that they can use, resell, or donate for purposes like cancer research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

### Content and Intellectual Property
[[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]] is engaging in licensing deals with content creators (e.g., FT) to address concerns about training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:43">[03:05:43]</a>. Altman differentiates between general human knowledge, which he views as "open domain" (like learning math from the internet), and art, especially systems generating art in the style or likeness of another artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

He believes the debate will shift from training data to "what happens at inference time" as training data becomes less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. For instance, even if a model was not trained on Taylor Swift songs, if it generates music in her style based on prompts, questions of permission and compensation arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] has currently chosen not to develop music models due to the complexity of these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

[[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] has implemented internal "red-teaming" to prevent models like DALL-E from generating copyrighted characters directly (e.g., Darth Vader) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. However, the line is complex, as generating "Sith Lord Bulldog" is allowed, highlighting the nuances of cultural IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] has released a "spec" document outlining how its models are supposed to behave, acknowledging that defining exact limits is an ongoing discussion requiring broad input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

Altman noted the strong emotional reaction to [[apples_ai_developments_and_openai_partnership | Apple]]'s iPad ad that showed creative tools being crushed, stating that while he is "hugely positive on [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]]", there is something "beautiful about human creativity and human artistic expression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. He believes [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] should be a tool for greater creative heights while preserving the spirit of human artistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

### [[regulating_ai_and_its_implications | Regulating AI]]
Altman expresses concern about various proposed [[regulating_ai_and_its_implications | AI regulations]], particularly state-level ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. He believes that for "frontier [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] systems" capable of "significant Global harm," an international agency similar to those overseeing nuclear weapons or synthetic biology will be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This agency would focus on safety testing to ensure such systems do not "escape and recursively self-improve" or autonomously deploy bioweapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

He acknowledges concerns about "regulatory capture," where large companies with resources might benefit from regulations that burden startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. His proposed solution is to regulate models based on the cost of the computers they were trained on (e.g., over $10 billion or $100 billion), which would exempt most startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Altman emphasizes that this oversight should involve reviewing the *output* of the model through safety tests, not auditing its internal code or weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. He is "super nervous about regulatory overreach" and believes current legislative proposals often miss the mark and will quickly become outdated given the rapid pace of [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Mission Alignment

[[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]]'s non-profit board structure, where a majority of directors needed to be "disinterested," led to Altman not taking equity in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This decision has caused "weird questions" about his motivations and fueled "conspiracy theories" among tech commentators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. He regrets not having taken equity, as it would make his motivations clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Altman clarified that any projects involving device companies or chip fabs would belong to [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] and accrue equity to the company, not to him personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

During the November 2023 board crisis where Altman was fired and then reinstated, he described the experience as "crazy" and "insanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Despite strong disagreements with their decision-making and actions, Altman maintains respect for the former board members' "integrity or commitment to... the shared mission of safe and beneficial AGI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

[[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]]'s preferred organizational model is highly coordinated, not to prevent edge cases, but because the systems are "so complicated" and require "concentrating bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This approach allows them to undertake "big hard complicated things" like developing GPT-4, which involved putting the whole company's focus together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

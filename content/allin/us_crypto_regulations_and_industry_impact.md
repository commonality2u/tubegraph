The United States is currently facing significant challenges regarding [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_risks | cryptocurrency regulation]], with implications for innovation and the industry's future within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.

## Current Regulatory Stance
The U.S. authorities have "firmly pointed their guns at crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_risks | crypto]] is effectively "dead in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>, and that the country is "banning crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. This approach is seen as potentially driving companies overseas, which would be "terrible for American innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.

### Key Regulatory Actions
*   **SEC Wells Notice to Coinbase:** The SEC sent a Wells notice to Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>. Coinbase is considered the "gold standard" for operating correctly within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>, and has repeatedly requested a [[cryptocurrency_framework_and_regulation | regulatory framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>.
*   **Blame for Banking Crisis:** Gary Gensler, the [[new_sec_chair_and_its_impact_on_cryptocurrency_regulations | SEC Chair]], has blamed the banking crisis on crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>.
*   **Motivation for Crackdown:** The crackdown is perceived to be due to crypto being "most threatening to the establishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a> and having "pushed the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>. It is also suggested that the crackdown is not a coincidence, occurring at the same time as concerns about de-dollarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.

## Industry Response and Outlook
Brian Armstrong is "considering relocating out of the U.S. if the [[cryptocurrency_framework_and_regulation | regulatory clarity]] does not improve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>. The current climate is seen as a "bill has come due" for the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

A contrasting point highlighted is that FDX, which was characterized as "the most fraudulent," was the entity that came closest to obtaining a license, rather than compliant entities like Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>. This is attributed to figures like Sam Bankman-Fried possessing "skills in gaming the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a> by making large donations and understanding how to "play the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

The discussion also touched upon the concept of industries regulating themselves, with the analogy of the tobacco industry used as a cautionary tale where self-regulation failed to prevent harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>. It's argued that for areas impacting everyone, regardless of participation, there are "not many good examples of separate allegations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a> of successful self-regulation. Had the crypto industry been more "thoughtful about which tokens [and] NFT projects" to support, they might have avoided some of the current challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.

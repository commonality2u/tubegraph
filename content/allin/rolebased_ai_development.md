The landscape of [[AI Developments and Business Models | AI development]] is seeing an emergence of "vertical AI" startups, which are distinct from the well-known general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) such as [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]]'s GPT-4, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. While general-purpose LLMs are trained on vast internet data to answer questions on almost anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, vertical AI companies are specializing in specific job titles or societal roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

## Examples of Vertical AI Applications

Several startups are pioneering this vertical approach:
*   **Harvey** provides [[AI Agents and Automation | AI for lawyers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
*   **Abridge** offers an [[AI Agents and Automation | AI note-taker for doctors]], reportedly saving them hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
*   **TaxGPT** functions as an [[AI Agents and Automation | AI tax assistant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.
*   **Inflection**, Brett Teller's new venture, develops [[AI Agents and Automation | AI for customer support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

### Devon: The AI Software Engineer

A notable debut in this space is **Devon**, a tool from the startup Cognition, touted as an [[AI Agents and Automation | AI software engineer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Demos of Devon show it capable of fixing bugs in real-time, fine-tuning [[AI Developments and Business Models | AI models]], and building applications end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. While not confirmed, speculation suggests Devon might be built on [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]]'s GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Its CEO stated that Devon was created by enhancing an existing LLM with improved reasoning and long-term planning capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. On coding benchmarks, Devon reportedly performs significantly better than generic language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

## The Evolution to AI Agents and Automation

Chamath Palihapitiya finds this development "so powerful" and "incredible" given the rapid week-over-week progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. He suggests that what were once "impenetrable job types" for the average person, like being a developer, will become "like a command line interface where you just kind of describe in English what you want to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. This automation will broaden the accessibility of these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

David Sacks notes that autonomous coding is a core and obvious use case for LLMs because code is text and can be debugged via compilers, theoretically leading to high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. However, he points out that while Devon represents an "agent-first approach" ideal for generating new software projects, it becomes more challenging with existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. Other companies, like Sourcegraph with their Cody product, focus on a "context-first" approach for co-piloting within existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. Regardless of the approach, the overall trend is towards autonomous coding, making human coders significantly more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

David Friedberg highlights that this evolution moves from "co-pilots" that assist developers to full-fledged "agents" that act as the primary "pilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. The next step is the concept of an "[[AI Agents and Automation | AI conductor]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

> "I think what we're seeing in this era is everyone's taking a vertical human and creating a vertical version of a human um in the [[AI Developments and Business Models | AI]] era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.
> â€” David Friedberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>

These specialized tools will emerge as specific vertical tools that people use to automate and scale tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. The value will accrue to the company that offers the best "lawyer service" or "accounting service," etc., due to fine-tuning and unique data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

## Implications for Jobs and Company Structure

This shift has significant implications for [[AI and job displacement | job roles]] and the structure of companies:
*   Initially, AI acts as a co-pilot, then a peer, and eventually, a "conductor" that coordinates multiple [[AI Agents and Automation | AI agents]] (e.g., AI lawyer, AI accountant, AI developers, AI designer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.
*   This could lead to millions of companies with just "one person and then a whole layer of software and conductors and agents and bots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   Human expertise and creativity will still be essential for thinking through architecture, process, and ensuring AI agents perform their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   This technology creates "extraordinary leverage for people and organizations," increasing economic productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.
*   Instead of job losses, people may "level up" their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
*   Operational expenses for companies are projected to be cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

This era of vertical AI promises to democratize the ability to build and operate complex systems, fostering a new wave of solo entrepreneurs or small teams capable of creating substantial businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

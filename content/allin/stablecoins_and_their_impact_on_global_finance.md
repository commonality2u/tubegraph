## The Emergence of Stablecoins

[[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | Stablecoins]] are digital currencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by being pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. They are seen as a significant development in the cryptocurrency space, with the technology now considered "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, especially when built on platforms like Ethereum L2 or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

In contrast, [[importance_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_gold_as_financial_assets | Bitcoin]], while good as a store of value or a [[importance_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_gold_as_financial_assets | gold]] substitute, proved to be less effective as a payment method due to slow and expensive transactions, and its value not being denominated in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Stripe's Foray into Stablecoins

Stripe, a major payment processing company, has recognized the utility of [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] and followed their development since the [[importance_and_impact_of_bitcoin_and_gold_as_financial_assets | Bitcoin]] white paper was released in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The company acquired Bridge in late 2023, with the aim of building "the Stripe of [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stable coins]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This move helps Stripe expand its services beyond traditional payments to include lending, card issuance, treasury, money storage, and cross-border money movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

The All-In podcast, for example, could accept payments in [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] (specifically USDC) via Stripe with just a simple button click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Key Use Cases and Global Adoption

The most significant adoption of [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] is currently seen in cross-border transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This includes managing corporate treasury globally and sending remittances to people in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

One major driver of this adoption is the demand from consumers in countries with less stable or inflationary local currencies who wish to hold U.S. dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. For instance, in Nigeria, where the currency has devalued significantly, [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] allow individuals to store dollars, a product previously inaccessible to them at low transaction sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This phenomenon is likened to the Eurodollar system of the 1970s and 80s, which allowed companies to store dollars for stability, but with a high minimum transaction size of around a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Now, a consumer in Ecuador can hold a $1 USD balance using [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

While systems like UPI in India and Pix in Brazil, which are government-run payment solutions, have emerged in emerging markets, similar innovations have not yet taken hold in the US and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Impact on Global Financial Systems

The growing use of [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] in cross-border transactions could further solidify the [[dedollarization_and_global_economic_shifts | dollar's status]] as the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. By allowing global access to dollar balances through regulated [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] like USDC, the U.S. can maintain its financial influence, as these regulated [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] often back their value by buying U.S. treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Comparison to Traditional Payment Networks

Challenging the Visa and Mastercard duopoly is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. A significant portion of interchange fees charged to merchants flows back to issuing banks and then to consumers in the form of lending and card rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Card programs are not major profit centers for most large banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Therefore, any substitute for these networks would involve trade-offs, potentially reducing consumer rewards or protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Fraud and Efficiency

While [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] offer real-time payments any hour of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, a major challenge in online payments remains fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Companies like Stripe act as a "reputation network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a> across the internet economy, enabling merchants to trust end-users, as 93% of cards seen by Stripe have been seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Fraud is a "huge economic cost" for businesses, and its problems are "getting worse and harder" due to factors like ML, AI, and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

B2B transactions are also inefficient, with companies potentially losing 1-3% of revenue to accounts payable and receivable due to "baroque inefficient processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | Stablecoins]] could be part of the solution, but broader software solutions like Stripe Billing are also addressing these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Regulatory Considerations

The legality and regulation of [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] in the United States are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Regulated [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] often require backing by treasuries, which further supports [[dedollarization_and_global_economic_shifts | dollar supremacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Contrast with Meme Coins

While [[cryptocurrency_regulation_and_stable_coins | stablecoins]] aim for utility and stability, meme coins are viewed negatively. They are often seen as akin to gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a> and not productive for the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. The rapid digital frenzy they create, amplified by social feedback loops, can lead to significant losses for many while a few make large profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. The "rugging dynamic" – where creators or early investors quickly sell off their holdings, causing the price to crash – is considered particularly "pernicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

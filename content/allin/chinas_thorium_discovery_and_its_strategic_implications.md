China has made significant strides in energy independence and advanced nuclear technology, marked by the discovery of a massive thorium reserve and the operational success of a molten salt reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

## Massive Thorium Reserve Discovered
A giant thorium deposit was discovered in [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | Inner Mongolia]] at the Bayan Obo mining complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. This reserve is estimated at a million tons, enough to effectively power the entirety of [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]] for 60,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>. This discovery was kept confidential for nearly two years before being reported and confirmed in a government meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>.

### What is Thorium?
Thorium is a material that does not split and release energy unless it absorbs a neutron, after which it transmutes to uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. Key characteristics and advantages of thorium include:
*   **Abundance:** It is much more abundant in the Earth's crust than uranium, which is historically used for fission reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.
*   **Safety:** When used in a molten salt thorium reactor, it reduces the risk of a meltdown, can passively shut itself down, and operates at low pressure, so it cannot explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** Unlike uranium, which requires an expensive and difficult refining process to yield less than 1% usable fuel, 100% of thorium can be used as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>. This makes it a very low-cost and easy fuel source to put into production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>.

The [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | United States]] also possesses significant thorium reserves, with about 64,000 tons in the continental North American region, enough to power the country for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.

## China's Advancements in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs)
[[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]] has secretly built and operated a molten salt reactor, showing continuous use without needing a shutdown and refueling cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. This experimental unit is 2 megawatts, with plans to take a 10 megawatt unit live by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

Molten salt reactors are a safer and more reliable way of producing power with a more abundant fuel source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>. This technology, which allows for very small, modular nuclear reactors that can be quickly built, stood up, and safely operated in a distributed way, was pioneered by the [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | US]] decades ago at Oak Ridge National Lab before being shelved due to regulatory barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>.

## Strategic Implications
This development provides [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]] with a significant [[economic_dependency_concerns_with_china | economic advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. The ability to deploy many small, distributed reactors instead of large, centralized gigawatt stations could lead to much cheaper and higher volumes of electricity for [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>. This is not even built into [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China's]] current energy projections, suggesting a potential for even greater energy production capacity than currently forecasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

The **[[ai_cold_war_and_chinas_semiconductor_strategy | buildout of electricity]]** and its cost are key to the strategic competition between the [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | US]] and [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]] this century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>. If [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]] can make new energy systems cheaper and scale them faster than the [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | United States]], it will gain an advantage in manufacturing, production, and transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>.

## Broader Energy Race
Beyond thorium, [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]] is also advancing in nuclear fusion technology. A satellite photo revealed a very large-scale fusion research center in Myang, [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]], which is 50% larger than the national ignition facility in the [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>. Fusion technology, which could theoretically use water from the ocean to create unlimited free energy, represents the next generation of energy systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>.

The regulatory constraints in the [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | United States]] are seen as a major impediment, with other countries, like [[chinas_nuclear_energy_buildout | China]], capitalizing on foundational research funded and then shelved in the [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | US]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>. This highlights a critical need for the [[US__china_relations_and_business_impact | United States]] to address regulatory barriers to maintain its strategic position in energy technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:34">[01:27:34]</a>.

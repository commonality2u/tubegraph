The United States faces a significant issue regarding its inability to independently manage its essential needs, leading to reliance on external entities whose perspectives on the U.S. could rapidly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To address this, there is a recognized need to measure and protect four critical areas to ensure national self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Four Critical Areas for National Security

1.  **Technology and [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_economic_impact | Artificial Intelligence]]**
    This area includes both the chips and the enabling technology essential for [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_economic_impact | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is crucial to establish a robust and predominantly American supply chain for these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
2.  **Energy**
    The U.S. currently lacks the capacity to quickly produce the necessary energy it requires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Furthermore, critical supply chains, such as those for photovoltaics, are vulnerable to disruption by countries like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
3.  **Critical Material Inputs**
    There is a dependency on critical material inputs that are fundamental to the material science of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This includes a problem with critical minerals, rare earths, and other material science inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
4.  **Pharmaceutical Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)**
    Ensuring that American citizens have access to essential medicines means having the capability not only to manufacture but also to design pharmaceutical APIs domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

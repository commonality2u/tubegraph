The recent political shift and anticipated regulatory changes are expected to significantly influence the landscape of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) [00:23:50]. A key factor is the perceived end of stringent regulatory oversight, particularly from figures like Lina Khan, coupled with a renewed sense of economic optimism [00:23:01].

## The Regulatory Environment Shift

The election outcome has led to an outlook where policies are viewed as stimulatory, featuring lower tax rates and increased deregulation [00:11:01]. This deregulatory approach is seen to benefit markets that have been hampered by regulatory oversight and challenges, such as crypto, finance, and fintech [00:11:10]. These sectors are expected to benefit by being able to launch products and generate revenue more quickly [00:11:27].

Specifically, changes at key regulatory bodies are anticipated:
*   **SEC**: Donald Trump has expressed intent to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, potentially on day one of his term [00:08:44]. While a president cannot directly fire the SEC chair before their term ends in 2026, Gensler could resign [00:09:33]. Gensler's recent press release, stating "it's been a great honor to serve," was interpreted by some as a signal of his intent to step down [00:09:50].
*   **FTC**: The "wrath of Lena Khan" is expected to come to an end [00:30:01]. While some of Lena Khan's actions, particularly against big tech, garnered support from populist Republicans like JD Vance and Matt Gates for challenging monopolies [00:36:14], her approach was sometimes seen as not sufficiently targeted or surgical, leading to a chilling effect on M&A, particularly in the small tech environment [00:37:01]. The hope is that her replacement will continue to apply pressure to large tech companies while improving the environment for smaller tech M&A [00:37:10].

## Impact on IPOs

The number of IPOs has been historically low in the past three years, akin to levels seen during the 2008-2009 Great Recession [00:22:02]. Similarly, venture capital distributions have been significantly down, with 2022-2024 combined totals being less than 2019 alone, and only about 14% of the 2021 peak [00:22:22].

Despite this, there is optimism that the IPO market could rebound. Companies like Klarna have already filed for IPOs [00:30:30]. Other companies that could potentially go public in 2025 include Databricks, Stripe, Wiz, Canva, Plaid, Rippling, and Airtable [00:23:39]. There's speculation about SpaceX potentially IPOing its Starlink unit [00:23:52], and even a long shot that Sam Altman might take [[OpenAIs Potential IPO and Corporate Restructuring | OpenAI]] public [00:24:00].

However, some experts remain subdued about the prospects for a significant IPO surge. The current 10-year Treasury yield at 4.5-5% makes it less compelling for SaaS or internet businesses that missed the zero-rate period to go public, as their fair value may not be attractive [00:24:49]. The existence of safer investments, like T-bills yielding 4.5%, challenges the risk-reward proposition for risky assets like IPOs [00:26:01].

Nonetheless, there's a strong sentiment that the market is becoming more risk-seeking [00:13:21]. For fintech and certain finance companies, deregulation and potentially reduced taxes could accelerate earnings, making their current multiples appear more attractive over a 5-10 year forecast [00:26:50]. There's also "backed up inventory" of companies that haven't gone public, with venture capitalists, boards, and founders experiencing "exhaustion in the market" [00:29:28]. The success of recent post-IPO rebounds for companies like Robinhood, Uber, [[Reddit IPO analysis and business growth challenges | Reddit]], DoorDash, and Instacart might encourage others to "take the haircut" on valuation and go public [00:31:06].

## Impact on Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)

There's a prevailing "backroom buzz" that the new administration will "make M&A great again" [00:22:56]. This is attributed to the anticipated end of the Lina Khan era at the FTC, tech giants sitting on massive amounts of cash, and a psychologically optimistic market [00:23:01].

While some foresee a boom, others, like Chamath Palihapitiya, believe M&A activity will remain "pretty subdued" [00:24:13]. He argues that truly accretive deals should not be dependent on the "emotional regulation or disregulation of the FTC commissioner" [00:25:37]. High interest rates also make it difficult to pull off very large M&A events [00:25:50].

A key debate revolves around whether the largest tech companies will be allowed to participate in M&A. Some believe that companies like Google are "handicapped" from making acquisitions due to ongoing concerns about regulatory scrutiny and the desire to avoid a "regulatory sledgehammer" [00:32:27]. This is also fueled by populist Republicans who want to "break up big tech" [00:32:24]. Google, with its monopolies in search, advertising, and YouTube, is often cited as a target for potential breakups or investigations [00:37:46].

An alternative proposal suggests that instead of the "Magnificent 7" (the largest tech companies) dominating M&A, regulations should allow companies under a trillion-dollar valuation to buy and sell each other. This would foster a "MAG 70" instead of a MAG 7, promoting competition and creating a healthier market environment by allowing mid-market cap companies to grow and challenge the established giants [00:54:01]. For instance, if Amazon couldn't acquire Waymo, but Waymo could merge with DoorDash or Airbnb, it could create new, powerful competitors [00:54:49].

Overall, the incoming administration is expected to foster a more fluid economic environment, potentially leading to increased M&A and IPO activity, especially for companies that have been constrained by previous regulatory approaches. However, the exact nature and beneficiaries of this shift, particularly concerning the largest tech companies, remain a subject of debate [00:53:52].

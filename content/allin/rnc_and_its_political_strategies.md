The 2024 Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee served as a platform to highlight key figures and [[political_strategy_involving_trump_and_republicans | political strategies]] for the Republican Party, particularly following an assassination attempt on Donald Trump five days prior to the taping date of July 18th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## David Sacks' Perceived Influence
David Sacks was jokingly referred to as the "architect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> or "Puppet Master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> by news stories like The Times and Business Insider regarding political strategies. Sacks, however, dismissed this, stating that [[political_strategy_involving_trump_and_republicans | President Trump]] makes his own decisions, and he was one of hundreds who offered opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Assassination Attempt on Donald Trump
On July 13th, 2024, at a rally in Pennsylvania, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight rounds from an AR-15 at Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. One bullet grazed Trump's right ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. A supporter, Corey Comparator, was killed protecting his family, and two others were critically injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service counter-sniper team 26 seconds after firing the first shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Crooks had no criminal record, was unknown to the FBI or Secret Service, was a registered Republican but also donated to a progressive PAC, and his motive is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He had written on Steam, "July 13th will be my Premiere watch as it unfolds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, and was found with a second phone and a detonation device, with an explosive device in his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Secret Service Failures and Calls for Accountability
There was significant criticism regarding the Secret Service's handling of the event. The closest rooftop, 130 yards away, was not secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The Secret Service director stated they didn't secure it due to its sloped surface, which was widely mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The timeline shows Crooks was identified as a Person of Interest (POI) at 5:10 PM, spotted with a rangefinder at 5:30 PM, on the roof by Secret Service at 5:52 PM, yet Trump took the stage at 6:02 PM and shots were fired at 6:12 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Commentators expressed disbelief at the "negligence and incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> of the Secret Service, highlighting their prior thoroughness in other protective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. Calls were made for the Secret Service director to resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, and for a full, independent investigation, with agents allowed to testify without fear of reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. The Secret Service's past deletion of Jan 6 texts was cited as a reason not to trust their self-investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

### Trump's Response and Public Image
Despite being shot, Trump stood up, faced the crowd, and told the Secret Service to wait, wanting to let the crowd know he was fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. His actions, including pumping his fist, were described as "iconic patriotic visuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> and a display of "courage that nobody can fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. The crowd responded with chants of "USA! USA! USA!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. This event was seen as boosting his [[us_elections_and_political_dynamics | election]] momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Political Rhetoric and its Impact
There was a discussion on the role of political rhetoric in contributing to such an event.
*   **Call for De-escalation:** Some argued that both Trump and Biden should issue a joint statement condemning violent language and toning down rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
*   **Critique of Media and Democratic Rhetoric:** Others asserted that the mainstream media has amplified violent rhetoric and associated it with a tolerable reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. It was specifically criticized that some Democrats and media figures have used extreme language, such as comparing Trump to Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a> or expressing disappointment that the assassination attempt failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. Biden's "put Trump in the bullseye" comment was also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. This "demonization" and "vitriol" was called an unacceptable [[political_strategy_involving_trump_and_republicans | campaign strategy]] by Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

## Republican National Convention (RNC) Highlights
### David Sacks' Speech
David Sacks gave a six-minute speech at the RNC, advocating for an end to the conflict in Ukraine and stating that the Biden Administration "provoked" the war with talk of NATO expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:33">[01:39:33]</a>. This stance, though initially shocking, received applause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a> and aligned with an evolving position within the Republican Party against "forever Wars" and "warmongers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>.

### Selection of JD Vance as VP Nominee
JD Vance was selected as the Vice Presidential nominee, a decision that surprised many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:38">[01:41:38]</a>.
*   **Background and Appeal:** Vance, 39, is from Appalachia, representing the "Forgotten man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a> and the "Maga Heartland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>. He also worked in tech as a venture capitalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>, giving him unusual "Maga plus Tech" appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>. He enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in the Iraq War, later realizing it was a mistake and wanting to avoid future "forever wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>. This makes him an "American Patriot" with "wisdom and the judgment to want to avoid those Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. He was backed by Peter Thiel with a $15 million donation to his Senate race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:20">[01:44:20]</a>.
*   **"New Republican Party" Vision:** Vance's selection was seen as cementing a "new vision of the Republican party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a> â€“ the "America First Maga message" that is populist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:13">[01:50:13]</a> and represents "the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:15">[01:50:15]</a>, moving away from being a "party of basically the Chamber of Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>. His speech highlighted the hollowing out of communities, job exports, factory closures, and fentanyl poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>. Vance represents a "conservatism of the heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.
*   **Policy Positions:** Vance holds views such as breaking up big Tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:38">[01:49:38]</a>, being pro-union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:40">[01:49:40]</a>, and has been "relatively positive towards Lenina Khan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a> due to her willingness to challenge Big Tech monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:04">[02:00:04]</a>. He also emphasizes resisting censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:11">[02:12:11]</a>.
*   **Concerns:** Some concerns about Vance's selection included the "Nationalist agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:10">[01:56:10]</a> and "isolationism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:12">[01:56:12]</a> which could be inflationary and counter to global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:14">[01:56:14]</a>.

### Other Speakers and Inclusivity
The RNC featured speakers like Amber Rose, who described her "red pilling" journey from believing negative media portrayals of Trump to realizing they were slanderous and becoming friends with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>. The inclusion of diverse voices like Amber Rose and the Teamsters was seen as evidence of the Republican Party's "wide open tent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>, providing a model for the [[Democratic partys challenges and strategies | Democratic Party]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>.

## Outlook for a Potential Trump Administration
A potential Trump administration is predicted to have a "very youthful cabinet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a> of people in their 30s and 40s, emphasizing "Youth and vigor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:22">[01:49:22]</a>. In terms of economic [[american_political_and_economic_strategies | strategy]], a Trump administration might see more mid-market M&A, particularly acquisitions under $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:21">[02:12:21]</a>.

### Contrast with Democratic Party Dynamics
There was a discussion on the potential for [[democratic_partys_challenges_and_strategies | Joe Biden]] to resign, continuing a "hot swap summer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:46">[02:14:46]</a>. This speculation was fueled by his verbal gaffes in interviews and the reported withdrawal of support from major donors like Kenberg, signaling the end of his campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. This highlighted a perception of the Democratic Party's internal dynamics being influenced by financial backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:16">[02:17:16]</a>.# RNC and its Political Strategies

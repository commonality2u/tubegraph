## Starship Development

The second [[SpaceX Starship launch and its implications|Starship]] is currently stacked at Starbase and ready for its next flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>. The team believes they have completed all necessary requirements requested by the FAA, and are hopeful for a license soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The primary factor holding back the second launch is [[Regulatory challenges faced by SpaceX and other industries|FAA approval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

For this mission, [[SpaceX Starship launch and its implications|SpaceX]] is implementing a new "hot staging" technique, where the upper-stage engines ignite while the boost stage is still firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:03">[03:02:03]</a>. This method is considered the most efficient for rocket stage separation when going to orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

Regarding the probability of success:
*   There is hoped to be "well over 50% chance of getting to Stage separation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   The chance of reaching orbit is estimated at "close to 50% chance" if hot staging works, possibly "above 30% chance" overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

[[SpaceX Starship launch and its implications|Starship]] is more than twice the size of the Saturn V and, with its extra rocket thrust, will have roughly three times the thrust of a Saturn V Moon rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:40">[04:06:40]</a>. Unlike the Saturn V, which was completely expendable, [[SpaceX Starship launch and its implications|Starship]] is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable, with both the booster and the ship returning to the launch site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, where they are caught by "giant mega arms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This system aims for "aircraft level flight rates" for a rocket much larger than a 747 or A380 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Starlink Operations and Impact

Starlink provides internet connectivity, including in-flight connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. The latency for Starlink is very low, "less than 20 milliseconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, which can make it a better connection than some home internet services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Starlink's Role in Ukraine

[[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications|SpaceX]] has provided Starlink connectivity to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, within a few days of its start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. The Ukrainian government has stated that Starlink was "instrumental in the defense of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Starlink serves as the "fundamental communication backbone" for the Ukrainian government and essential services like first responders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. It is described as "the only thing that works on the warfront" because everything else has been jammed by the Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:45">[11:56:45]</a>.

[[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications|SpaceX]] has incurred significant out-of-pocket costs to support Ukraine, estimated at approximately $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:39">[13:15:39]</a>. This figure does not account for the "massive risk to the entire Starlink constellation" due to potential Russian attempts to delete or destroy it through cyberattacks or anti-satellite weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. [[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications|SpaceX]] has not received compensation for this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

A situation arose where the Ukrainian government requested Starlink connectivity to be turned on in the region around Crimea for a "drone type attack" on the Russian fleet in Sevastopol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. However, this region was sanctioned by the United States against Russia, and [[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications|SpaceX]] did not have explicit government approval to provide connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Granting the request would have meant taking part in a "major act of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. No directive from the US President to turn it on was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

> "This would not defeat Russia, it would enrage Russia." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>

### SpaceX's Global Presence

[[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications|SpaceX]] and Starlink currently have "zero business in China" as they are not allowed to operate there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. While [[Elon Musks companies and roles|Elon Musk's]] other business interests, such as Tesla, have a significant presence in China, the bulk of his business interests are outside of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:20:00">[33:20:00]</a>.

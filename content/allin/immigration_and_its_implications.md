Recent discussions have highlighted significant concerns regarding [[immigration_and_its_effects_on_politics_and_society | immigration and its effects on politics and society]] in the United States, particularly concerning Social Security number issuance, border security, and the broader [[impact_of_immigration_policies | impact of immigration policies]] on national resources and integrity.

## Social Security Numbers for Non-Citizens
The Social Security number (SSN) was initially established in 1936 to track citizens' earnings [00:06:24]. In the 1990s, the practice expanded to include non-citizens authorized to work in the U.S. for tax collection purposes [00:06:28]. Legal immigrants, such as green card holders or those on valid visas (e.g., TN Visa), are required to have an SSN to work and contribute to Social Security and Medicare [00:06:37].

However, recent data analysis reveals a dramatic increase in SSNs issued to non-citizens through the "Enumeration Beyond Entry" (EBE) program [00:05:39]. This program, which became active in 2017, saw a significant ramp-up, from a baseline of 300,000-400,000 people annually to 2.1 million people [00:05:48]. The vast majority of this growth is linked to asylum programs and individuals entering the country on Notices to Appear (NTAs) at the border or airports [00:09:24].

## Concerns and Identified Issues
### Abuses in Asylum Process
The rapid growth in SSN issuance is attributed to an alleged abuse of the asylum program [00:10:07]. The requirements for claiming asylum were "super opened" [00:10:10], with a four-page form historically used to prove credible fear of torture or murder by their home country being replaced by a four-question form with "super leading" questions [00:10:17]. This process allowed individuals who entered the country illegally to gain quasi-legal status by being issued an NTA, setting a court date typically six years out [00:11:30]. During this waiting period, they could file an asylum application, then a work authorization form (765), and subsequently receive an SSN automatically by mail without an interview [00:11:53].

### Lack of Verification and Data Integrity
A critical concern is the lack of ID verification in this process [00:12:33]. Individuals presented various forms of ID, or sometimes none at all [00:12:40]. A disturbing finding was that the most common birth date recorded was January 1, suggesting that applicants simply provided a default date if actual documentation was unavailable or unknown [00:12:58]. Furthermore, 23% of records lacked fingerprints [00:13:18], indicating a breakdown in biometric data collection, potentially due to border agents being overwhelmed [00:13:23].

### Strain on Border Agents
The surge in crossings had a severe human impact on border personnel, with Border Patrol and Border Protection reporting the highest suicide rates of all time during this period, exceeding 70 agents [00:13:31].

### Downstream Consequences and Fraud
Issuing SSNs to non-citizens has significant downstream consequences for the U.S. [00:16:07]:
*   **Access to Benefits:** Every benefit program examined was being accessed by these individuals [00:17:08]. For example, 1.3 million were on Medicaid [00:14:19], and others were found on unemployment benefits [00:17:13]. Those receiving benefits are not contributing to the system [00:17:18].
*   **Voter Registration and Voting:** Thousands of non-citizens were found registered to vote in public voter rolls across a handful of states, and many had actually voted, which is a federal crime [00:14:31]. This is significantly higher than historical fraud cases identified by organizations like the Heritage Foundation [00:15:11].
*   **Criminality and Watchlists:** Data shared with the National Targeting Center revealed "hardheads," including criminals and individuals on terror watch lists, within this group [00:17:24].
*   **Human Trafficking:** The system inadvertently created a "money magnet" that attracted individuals, leading to 13 to 15 billion dollars annually being paid to human traffickers [00:26:37]. Many migrants died en route, and some are subjected to debt servitude to pay off their travel costs [00:26:50].

## Political and Economic Debates
### Public Consensus vs. Policy
There is a wide consensus among the American population to stop illegal [[border_control_and_immigration_policy | immigration policy and border security challenges]], particularly at the southern border [00:21:57]. Many believe the border should be shut down, and all immigration should be legal [00:25:04].

Antonio, a former Democrat who has volunteered to assist the government, emphasizes that the issue is not political but a human rights tragedy [00:30:38]. He attributes the current problems to specific policies implemented by former administrators that "set all the defaults to kind of max open" with no ID requirements and open payment defaults [00:29:16].

### Arguments for and Against Current Policies
Ben Shapiro suggests a logical approach to [[impact_of_immigration_policies | immigration policy]] based on whether an individual will benefit the United States [00:23:07]. This means prioritizing the removal of criminal illegal aliens and those who are a net draw on resources (e.g., receiving Medicaid or disability benefits under false asylum claims) [00:22:48]. He notes that the previous administration's success in reducing border crossings was significant [00:22:11].

The idea that the Democratic party is motivated to increase its voter base through open [[immigration_policy_and_border_security_challenges | immigration policies]] is a controversial claim [00:28:01]. While there are allegations of thousands of non-citizens registering and voting, critics argue that the impact on elections is minimal and that such claims often stem from misinterpretations of data [00:33:16]. However, the long-term demographic shift caused by immigration is a recognized phenomenon, with implications for future electoral outcomes [00:35:38].

### Economic Impact and Skilled Workforce
The discussion also touches upon the broader [[us_immigration_and_labor_market_dynamics | US immigration and labor market dynamics]]. While some non-citizens are "taking out" of the system through benefits, others are employed and "paying in" [00:17:18]. A key part of [[us_immigration_policy_and_skilled_force | US immigration policy and skilled workforce]] should be to attract brilliant people globally, including those with degrees from U.S. institutions, and allow them to stay and contribute to the entrepreneurial system [01:24:50].

The long-term implications of these policies, particularly the potential for a large state like California to shift political alignment due to immigration (referencing Ronald Reagan's amnesty program), highlight the profound and often unintended consequences of [[immigration_policies_and_labor_market_dynamics_in_the_us | immigration policies and labor market dynamics in the US]] [00:36:40].

## Looking Forward
The ongoing efforts aim to identify criminals and terrorists, as well as those "mooching off the system" [02:08]. The next major push involves figuring out how to save money and find fraud [00:04:43]. The focus remains on data-driven truth to inform future policy decisions regarding who should be allowed to stay and who should be removed [00:25:50]. This includes prosecuting individuals found to have registered or voted illegally [00:14:50].

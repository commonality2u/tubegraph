## 2024 Political Predictions

The "All-In Podcast" hosts shared their political predictions for 2024, identifying potential winners and losers, along with their most contrarian beliefs.

### Biggest Political Winner in 2024

*   **Vladimir Putin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** David Sacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Putin stabilized his economy after Western sanctions and gained the upper hand militarily in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Sacks believes 2024 will see Putin consolidating and potentially making new gains in Ukraine, exposing the "stalemate narrative" as false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. His stance against the West has increased his influence in the Global South and [[upcoming_2024_us_election_dynamics_and_kamala_harriss_policy_proposals | BRICS]] countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Sacks states that the "project Ukraine" will fall apart in 2024, reinforcing Putin's position as a big winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   **Note:** Sacks clarified he is not rooting for Putin, but providing an honest prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

*   **Independent Third Party in the US** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** David Friedberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Friedberg cited a poll showing over 60% of people interested in a third party or independent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. He mentioned Ross Perot's 18-19% general [[election_results_and_political_analysis | election vote]] in 1992 and [[trump_and_kamala_harris_2024_presidential_race_dynamics | RFK Jr.]] running on an independent ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **Independent Centrists** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** Chamath Palihapitiya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Palihapitiya believes the 2024 [[us_elections_and_political_dynamics | election]] will start the breakdown of the two-party system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. He noted that many people he knows, particularly former Democrats, no longer want to identify with either party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. [[trump_and_kamala_harris_2024_presidential_race_dynamics | RFK Jr.]] being added to the Utah ballot was cited as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

*   **Darkhorse Presidential Candidate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** Jason Calacanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Calacanis predicts a Darkhorse candidate will beat both Trump and Biden in a rematch that "nobody wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Biggest Political Loser in 2024

*   **The Copes (Old School Republicans)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** Chamath Palihapitiya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Palihapitiya views them as the largest spenders in Republican [[political_winners_and_losers_of_2022 | politics]] and a consistent negative indicator of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. He suggests fading their trades, noting that he would now short the Haley spread trade, which he was long on in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

*   **Ukraine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** David Friedberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Friedberg believes attention will shift to the brewing conflict in the Middle East during an [[upcoming_2024_us_election_dynamics_and_kamala_harriss_policy_proposals | election year]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. He stated that continued funding for the Ukraine-Russia conflict is becoming unpopular, and the US will likely lack the resources to commit to Ukraine, leading to its NATO shot fading away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Sacks concurred, citing demographic decline with half a million military casualties and 10 million people having fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

*   **The Collective West** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** David Sacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Sacks argues that the West's "huge bet" to pressure and challenge Putin in Ukraine has "completely crapped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. He also highlighted Israel's invasion of Gaza as not going well, leading to a humanitarian crisis and international condemnation for Israel, which reflects negatively on America and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Sacks expects "tremendous disruption" in elections in the US and Europe, noting that large parts of Europe, particularly Germany, are in recession due to losing cheap Russian gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

*   **Netanyahu** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** Jason Calacanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Calacanis stated that major Israeli polls suggest a desire for Netanyahu to be out, with Vox putting the odds of his exit at 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. He also noted that the situation in Gaza is not helping and there's a "massive shift" from initial support for Israel to a call for a different approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

### Most Contrarian Belief of 2024

*   **Enterprise Value of OpenAI Goes Down** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** Chamath Palihapitiya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Palihapitiya believes this is due to industry factors rather than OpenAI itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. He cited high latency and untenable costs of a million tokens across AI platforms, predicting that capitalism will force cheaper, faster solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. He anticipates open-source models will proliferate, putting pressure on proprietary models, and the existing economics will be reallocated to new players with custom hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.

*   **Increased Probability of a Nuclear Weapon Being Used** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** David Friedberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Friedberg believes conflict escalation will continue, driven by "big cycles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. He attributes this to declining military supplies, declining appetite and capacity for traditional "meat grinder type conflicts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. He suggests a scenario where someone is "backed into a corner" and a tactical low-yield nuclear weapon is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. While calling it a 1-2% chance, he states it's 10x higher than five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

*   **Turkey Gets Challenged to Leave NATO** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** David Friedberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Friedberg noted political commentary about Turkey not being a trusted ally, especially with its siding with Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Despite the US incentive to keep Turkey in NATO due to its large army, there is a risk of the "first fracturing of NATO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.

*   **Soft Landing Gets Very Bumpy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** David Sacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Sacks believes markets became overly optimistic in late 2023, pricing in significant Fed rate cuts and leading to a stock market rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. He predicts that 2024 will be "a lot bumpier" both politically and economically due to this "too much euphoria and overoptimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

*   **Apple Making Huge Gains in Generative AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>
    *   **Prediction by:** Jason Calacanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>
    *   **Rationale:** Calacanis believes Apple will not remain on the sidelines in AI and will become a significant player, possibly rebooting Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.

China is rapidly advancing its nuclear energy capabilities, demonstrating a significant competitive edge in electricity production and new capacity buildout compared to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. This progress is highlighted by new reactor technologies and ambitious long-term plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>.

## Current and Projected Electricity Production
Today, China possesses approximately 3 terawatts (TW) of total electricity production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>, with nuclear power accounting for about 2% to 3% of that total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>. In contrast, the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | United States]] has roughly 1 TW of total electricity production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.

By 2050, China aims to triple its electricity production to 8.7 TW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>, with 88% of its power from renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>. By 2060, China targets 18% of its overall power to come from nuclear reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. The [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | US]] projects to double its capacity to 2 TW by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>, mainly through natural gas, solar, and wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.

## Nuclear Reactor Development
China currently has 26 nuclear reactors under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:33">[01:28:33]</a> and plans for building 300 more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>. Their stated plans include 500 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear capacity, which is half of the total [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | US]] electricity production capacity today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>.

### Generation IV Reactors: High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Pebble-Bed Reactor (HTR-PM)
China has made significant strides in [[nuclear_energy_and_small_modular_reactors | Generation IV nuclear reactors]], specifically with their High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Pebble-Bed Reactor (HTR-PM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>.

*   **Safety Profile:** This new technology demonstrates that it "cannot melt down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>, addressing concerns associated with older reactors like Fukushima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. During tests, even with cooling turned off, the system maintained temperature control and did not fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.
    *   Older reactors require continuous water pumping to cool uranium rods, and failure of this system or inability to pull rods can lead to a meltdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>.
*   **Design:** The HTR-PM uses billiard-ball-sized pebbles with uranium cores that drop into a central reactor chamber. Heat is generated when uranium is close to other uranium, captured by circulating helium gas, which then heats water to drive a turbine and generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Waste:** These Gen IV reactors are smaller, more modular, safer, more efficient, and produce much less waste compared to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:18">[01:34:18]</a>. Used pebbles still require underground storage for 10,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.
*   **Development and Operation:** Construction of China's HTR-PM facility at the Shidaowan site in Shandong Province began in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>. Operational tests started in December 2022, and safety tests were successfully completed in the summer of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>. Commercial operations commenced in December 2023, with the reactor actively producing power and on the grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>. The design for this reactor was first proposed in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

## Economic Competitiveness
China's electricity costs are significantly lower than those in the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | US]]:
*   **Current Cost:** China averages 7 to 9 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | US]] is 17 to 25 cents per kWh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
*   **Projected Cost:** China expects to drop its price to less than 6 cents per kWh due to the expansion of renewables and nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.
*   **New Capacity Buildout Cost:** The International Energy Agency estimates electricity from nuclear power costs $65 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in China, compared to $105 in the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | US]] and $140 in the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. Recent data suggests [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | US]] costs can be five to ten times what it costs to build out in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

This cost differential highlights a major industrial challenge for the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | United States]] in the coming decades, particularly as industries like [[ai_cold_war_and_chinas_semiconductor_strategy | AI]] will be heavily driven by power costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>.

## Strategic Implications
The disparity in energy production and cost creates a long-term competitive disadvantage for the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>. The inability to rapidly accelerate high-power output systems like [[nuclear_energy_and_small_modular_reactors | nuclear power]] could lead to [[the_potential_for_nuclear_conflict_in_global_geopolitics | conflict]] with this rising power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>. Investing in and deregulating [[nuclear_energy_and_small_modular_reactors | nuclear reactor technology]] in the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | US]] is deemed critical for maintaining a competitive playing field with China, impacting national security and industrial strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>.

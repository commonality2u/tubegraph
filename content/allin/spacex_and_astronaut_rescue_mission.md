## [[SpaceX and astronaut rescue mission | SpaceX and Astronaut Rescue Mission]]

[[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]] successfully rescued two astronauts who had been stranded in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. This mission occurred after the astronauts had been stuck for nine months due to the [[Boeings technical issues with the Starliner project | Boeing Starliner]] debacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. Upon landing, dolphins were seen breaching around the capsule, creating a "magical" scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

### [[Boeings technical issues with the Starliner project | Boeing's Starliner]] Debacle and [[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]]'s Crew Dragon

The [[Boeings technical issues with the Starliner project | Starliner]] program, which had spent significantly more than the Crew Dragon program, is now considered "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. In contrast, [[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]]'s Crew Dragon program has completed 16 crewed flights to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. These flights include 11 for NASA and four private commercial missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. The Crew Dragon continues to perform successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.

### [[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications | SpaceX]]'s Cost-Effectiveness

Despite discussions about potential conflicts of interest related to [[Elon Musks companies and roles | Elon Musk]]'s involvement with [[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]] and its relationship with the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>, the reduction in cost achieved by [[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications | SpaceX]] is highlighted as making such concerns "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. It is noted that no other entity is close to matching [[SpaceX Achievements and Economic Implications | SpaceX]]'s cost for space access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

The company is considered the "absolute cheapest in the market" and consistently able to reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Other alternatives like Blue Origin and Relativity Space are years away from offering comparable services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>.

### Political and Societal Implications

The handling of the stranded astronauts became a political issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>. There was a sentiment that America should not abandon its people, especially in space, and that the delay in engaging [[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]] was inexcusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. The astronauts themselves reportedly confirmed that [[Elon Musks companies and roles | Elon Musk]] offered assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.

The success of private enterprises like [[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]] is seen as inspiring for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. The "space race" is now framed as a competition between [[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]]'s platform and China's space program, which has developed a rocket design comparable to [[Starship and SpaceXs progress | SpaceX]]'s Starship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]], prompting discussions about the company's investment strategy and [[Apples AI developments and OpenAI partnership | Apple's valuation]] and future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

## Berkshire Hathaway's Sale of Apple Stock

Chamath Palihapitiya had previously observed a trend in Warren Buffett's letters: when Buffett stops mentioning a company, it often indicates he is selling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This pattern appears to hold true for [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. Since the beginning of the year, Berkshire Hathaway has sold 55% of its holdings in [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. At the end of the year, [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] represented 50% of Berkshire's non-majority owned stock holdings, valued at $174 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

### Potential Reasons for the Sale

Several theories have been put forth to explain Berkshire Hathaway's divestment:

*   **Overweighting**
    Some argue that the [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] position became too large, exceeding 50% of Berkshire's portfolio at the start of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.
*   **Valuation Concerns**
    The stock's valuation multiple might have become too high, trading at nearly 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] stock has risen 900% since Berkshire bought it in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
*   **Cash Accumulation**
    Warren Buffett is building up a "war chest" of cash, the largest cash pile he has ever held, suggesting a defensive position amidst [[market_volatility_and_economic_strategies | market volatility]] and a potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. This cash could be used for future acquisitions, or to earn a 5% return on $300 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Risk**
    [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] is facing significant regulatory scrutiny that could impact its financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. Key areas of concern include:
    *   **[[Googles AI investment and strategy | Google]] Antitrust Case**: [[Googles AI investment and strategy | Google]] pays [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] $20 billion annually to be the default search engine, a revenue stream at 99% margin that is at risk if antitrust rulings stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.
    *   **China Dependency**: [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] has deep relationships with China for manufacturing and product sales, posing a risk as regulators examine company ties to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. Chamath suggested Buffett's sale of Chinese company BYD might indicate a broader concern about [[chinese_investment_strategies | China dependency]] in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
    *   **App Store Fees**: The 30% "Vig" [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] takes on its App Store is under regulatory scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **Succession Planning**: Following the death of Charlie Munger, Buffett may be consolidating Berkshire's portfolio to ensure a smooth transition to his successor, Greg Abel, by reducing risk exposure like dependency on a single stock or country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

## Apple's Valuation and Challenges

[[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]]'s stock, despite the sales, is still up 11-12% year-to-date and recently came off its all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. It currently holds over $100 billion in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

However, [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] faces challenges due to its status as an "effective and unregulated Monopoly" that "doesn't really know what to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. Unlike many of Berkshire's other significant holdings (e.g., BNSF Railway, Berkshire Energy, Geico), which are regulated monopolies with stable, government-set pricing and distribution, [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] operates in an unregulated environment, making it vulnerable to financially painful transitions once it becomes regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

The potential loss of the $20 billion annual payment from [[Googles AI investment and strategy | Google]] for default search engine status, if the antitrust ruling stands, could significantly impact [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]]'s value, potentially reducing it by half a trillion to a trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.

## Investment Strategy Implications

Berkshire's decision underscores the principle that there is "no free money" in leveraged trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Buffett's philosophy generally favors companies with great managers, premium products, high margins, and durable moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. While [[challenges_facing_apple | Apple]] seemingly fits this criteria, its increasing exposure to regulatory risk and potential future instability differentiate it from Berkshire's historically stable, regulated holdings. The move suggests a strategic shift towards defensive positioning and readiness for future [[investments_and_asset_performance_predictions_for_2024 | investment opportunities]] in a potentially [[market_volatility_and_economic_strategies | volatile market]] environment.

Entering the Chinese market necessitates a complete re-evaluation of business strategies, as a complacent approach will likely lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Success requires starting from first principles and a bottom-up approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Business Environment in China
Despite common recommendations to secure a 50/50 partnership, direct experience on the ground showed no bias and fair treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This suggests that while [[business_challenges_in_china | common advice]] might suggest specific structures, a hands-on approach can lead to different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The "China War" Goes Global
At a certain point, the competitive landscape in China expanded globally, described as the "China war went global" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This shift involved the Chinese government, including entities like the sovereign wealth fund CIC, making significant [[chinese_investment_strategies | strategic investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. They invested hundreds of millions and billions of dollars in global competitors to intentionally deplete funds and make it harder for foreign companies to compete within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Strategic Investments by China
A notable example of this strategy is Apple's forced investment of a billion dollars in Didi Global, a move uncharacteristic for Apple, which typically avoids investing in other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This suggests a strategic imperative driven by the Chinese market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Such [[impact_of_foreign_investments_in_china_and_ai | foreign investments]] aim to influence the global competitive balance, impacting how companies can operate and compete not just in China but worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## High-Stakes Negotiation and Competition
In response to these global pressures, companies had to shift their ambitions from seeking outright market dominance (going for the gold) to securing a strong competitive position (getting the silver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This involved intense negotiations, such as securing 20% of a merged entity with Didi Global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. To achieve this, a company had to drastically increase its spending to demonstrate aggressive competition and induce fear in the competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. During peak negotiations for a term sheet, weekly expenditures reached $75 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This high-pressure poker game involved rapidly increasing market share to exert pressure and secure a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

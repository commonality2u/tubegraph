During the Trump administration from 2017 to 2021, Jared Kushner served as a Senior Adviser, focusing on the US-Mexico relationship and leading Middle East peace efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The administration's approach to foreign policy and economic strategy was characterized by a distinct departure from traditional norms, driven by entrepreneurial instincts and a focus on national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

## Political Approach

The Trump campaign and subsequent administration operated in an "entrepreneurial" manner, which allowed them to make dollars "go a lot further" by building a data operation, targeting advertisers, and managing events differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Rather than moderating views based on polls, [[Political strategy involving Trump and Republicans | Donald Trump]] put forward his own perspectives, even heterodoxical ones on trade within the Republican primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. He demonstrated a "talent and skill of persuasion" to move polls to him and consistently evolved and learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Key issues like illegal immigration, which was not a top-five concern when he started his campaign, became critical by the end due to his focus on the southern border and national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

Kushner notes that [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]] allowed him to always tell the truth and appreciated that he only offered expertise where he had it, helping to translate campaign speeches into technical policy for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

## Foreign Policy

### Middle East Peace Efforts

Kushner inherited a Middle East that was "on fire" in 2017, with ISIS controlling a caliphate the size of Ohio, Syria in civil war, and Libya and Yemen destabilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>. Iran was also on a path to nuclear weapons, having received $150 billion in cash from the JCPOA deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>.

[[Trumps Middle East trip and economic deals | Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia]] was pivotal. He conveyed that regional problems were the Middle East's to solve, urging them to "root this ideology out of your homes, get it out of your mosques, get it out of this Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. This led to agreements including:
*   Over $500 billion in investments and arms sales with Saudi Arabia, creating US jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>.
*   A counter-terrorism finance center where Gulf countries cooperated with the US Treasury to stop funding to terrorist organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>.
*   A counter-extremism center in Saudi Arabia to combat online radicalization and replace radical clerics with those promoting a more peaceful Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>.

These efforts helped change Saudi Arabia's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>. Kushner noted a "massive mind shift" among Gulf leaders post-Arab Spring, focusing on creating economic opportunity for their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. He viewed the Middle East divide as between leaders seeking opportunity and those clinging to past issues to deflect from shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>.

The administration achieved five peace deals between Israel and majority-Muslim countries (the Abraham Accords) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>. Kushner asserts that this work helped the "new Middle East emerge," which included an economic project in Saudi Arabia and the UAE that serves as a model for other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>. This vision aims to move away from an "Islamist jihadist project" toward a collaborative Middle East with economic opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>.

#### Iran

Under [[US foreign policy and global relations | Trump]], Iran was "totally broke," with oil sales reduced from 2.6 million barrels per day (under Obama) to 100,000 barrels per day when Trump left office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:00">[57:47:00]</a>. They were out of foreign currency reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:00">[58:00:00]</a>.

#### Palestine and Gaza

The administration cut funding to UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) to the Palestinians, which was controversial, with the administration arguing the money was being used to build "terror tunnels and rockets" rather than for schools and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:11:00">[58:11:00]</a>. Kushner characterized the Palestinian Authority (PA) leadership as corrupt and not popular in their own country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:39:00">[51:39:00]</a>. He noted that the PA President, Mahmoud Abbas, would fly in a $60 million private jet for visits, while Israel's Prime Minister would take a commercial flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>. This contributed to the Palestinian leadership being "basically broke" when Trump left office, and Arab countries "lost interest" in the cause due to its "morally bankrupt" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:28:00">[58:28:00]</a>.

Kushner believes a two-state solution is possible if it addresses Israel's security concerns and provides a viable economy for Palestinians, who he noted suffer from bad governance and lack basic rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. He recalls investors at a 2019 conference in Bahrain expressing willingness to help the Palestinian people but finding the region "not an investable place" due to a lack of fair judiciary, rule of law, and transparent institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:38:00">[52:38:00]</a>.

### Russia-Ukraine War

Kushner believes the Russia-Ukraine war was "very easily avoidable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>. During the Trump administration, the US armed Ukraine but also advised them against raising NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:53">[01:28:53]</a>. He suggests that the Biden administration's conversations with Ukraine about joining NATO prompted Russia to move its military to the front line, viewing it as an unacceptable threat due to historical and geographical factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. He also linked the timing to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which Russia may have perceived as American weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>. Kushner emphasizes the importance of avoiding nuclear war and finding a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>. He views the current Middle East conflict involving Israel, Palestinians, and Iran as a proxy war for Russia, aiming to stretch and distract the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

## Economic Strategies

### Trade Policy

[[Trumps Economic and Tariff Strategies | Trump's economic strategy]] involved defying conventional Republican trade orthodoxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>. He believed multilateral trade agreements favored weaker countries ganging up on stronger ones, advocating for bilateral deals instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
*   **TPP Withdrawal:** Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was criticized as a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. However, the administration then negotiated bilateral deals with Japan and Korea, achieving "95% of the market access" without damaging the US auto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.
*   **NAFTA Renegotiation:** The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was renegotiated in a year and a half, receiving over 80 bipartisan Senate votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. This new agreement set higher labor protection standards and aimed to make [[American political and economic strategies | America]] more competitive and reduce the trade deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.
*   **Tariffs:** Trump's willingness to impose tariffs, despite warnings of economic collapse, was a key feature. He held a deep-seated belief in this strategy, stating, "I've been saying this for 30 years, I believe it. I campaigned on it, I won on it. I have to see it through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. He also maintained flexibility, knowing he "could always take them off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.

### Overall Stance

Kushner stated that [[US political dynamics and trade policies | Trump]] wanted to change the world rather than just manage it, contrasting with the foreign policy establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:00">[57:28:00]</a>. Trump's approach questioned "forever wars" and argued for a return on US investments and that US aid was not an entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:16:00">[57:16:00]</a>. This perspective also included challenging [[US political landscape and economic policies | Republican groupthink]] on issues like entitlements (Social Security, Medicare) and immigration, where Trump was consistently proven correct in his instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Kushner noted that Trump's flexibility and unpredictability were some of his greatest assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

<div class="callout">
[!INFO] Key Principle
Kushner highlighted a core principle he applied to foreign policy problems during his time in government: "Don't condemn tomorrow to be like yesterday because you think it has to be." This involved seeking optimism, defining the best-case scenario from first principles, and working through problems to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

From: [[allin]] <br/> 

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has voted to ban non-compete agreements across the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. This decision marks a significant shift in employment law, with proponents arguing it will foster innovation and increase worker mobility.

## The Ruling

The FTC's vote was 3-2 in favor of the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. The ruling mandates that non-compete agreements be entirely banned and requires companies to inform their staff that existing non-competes are unenforceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. The new rule is set to take effect within 120 days, after which the vast majority of current non-competes will become unenforceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

## Impact and Exceptions

Approximately 18% of the total U.S. workforce, or 30 million people, are currently covered by some form of non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. The FTC anticipates that this ban will lead to the creation of 8,500 new startups annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

There are a few exceptions to the ban:
*   Existing non-competes for senior-level executives are exempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.
*   Non-competes formed in the context of the sale of a business are permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has stated its intention to sue over the ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.

## Debate and Perspectives

### California vs. Other States
Non-compete agreements are generally not enforceable in California, except under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. This has been a significant difference, with such agreements being actively enforced in other regions like Boston and New York, even for professions like hairdressers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

### Arguments for the Ban
Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic FTC Commissioner, described non-competes as "unfree and unfair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

David Sachs supports the ban, highlighting that California's lack of non-competes has significantly contributed to the tech industry's rapid innovation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. He argues that the free flow of talent, unhindered by such agreements, allows venture capitalists and skilled individuals to quickly converge on the best opportunities and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. Sachs believes that imposing non-competes would introduce enormous delays and friction in talent mobility, ultimately hindering innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. He views the FTC's action as a positive step towards maximizing the pace of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

Chamath Palihapitiya believes non-competes have no value in any market, except possibly East Coast financial markets where practices like "Beach leave" or "Garden leave" are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. He asserts that intellectual property is less valuable than ever, especially with the prevalence of trade secrets over patents, and the increasing trend towards open-source development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. Chamath advises employers to focus on hiring and paying the best people, and firing those who don't perform, rather than relying on restrictive agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>. He concludes that dynamic markets that add value are moving past these agreements, and it makes sense for everyone to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

### Arguments Against / Concerns
Andrew Ferguson, a Republican FTC Commissioner, expressed concern that the FTC might lack the authority from Congress to make such a sweeping ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. Sachs agrees that such a significant change should ideally be made by Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.

David Friedberg acknowledges both sides of the issue. He notes that in industries outside of tech, such as agriculture and financial services, non-competes are used to protect trade secrets and intellectual property (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. He argues that non-competes allow companies to invest in employees with confidence that their knowledge and information won't be immediately taken to a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. Friedberg suggests that removing non-competes could lead to less information sharing with employees and potentially lower salaries, as companies might be more fearful of knowledge walking out the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

### Industry Specifics
Non-competes are common in:
*   Agriculture and "ag inputs" industries, where new technology is developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.
*   Financial services, where they protect trade secrets and proprietary algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
*   Media, exemplified by cases like Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon, who had tight non-competes requiring full contract payouts before starting new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Business Moats
Sachs argues that while non-competes may no longer be enforceable, businesses can still build strong "moats" through network effects, data scale effects, strong products, and brand loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. He contrasts this with "legal arrangements" like patents and non-competes, which he considers less durable forms of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

### Talent Mobility and IP Misuse
The tech industry thrives on the free flow of talent, with average employment terms being relatively short (1-2 years, or 36 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. Employees are generally allowed to take knowledge gained "in their head" to new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>. However, it is strictly against the rules to take physical work products, documents, or company data (e.g., thumb drives, old computers, code, CRM databases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. Companies monitor work computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. Founders are advised to get permission and a waiver from their employers for side hustles and to use a "clean machine" for any new ventures to avoid IP claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
There was a famous instance where Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube, had early versions of YouTube code on a Facebook laptop, leading to speculation that Facebook could technically "own" YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
Steve Jobs famously sent an email to Bruce Chisen regarding Apple and Adobe's "no-poaching" agreement, highlighting the competitive dynamics of talent acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. This led to legal action and a settlement involving Google and Apple agreeing not to poach employees, with Eric Schmidt leaving Apple's board due to perceived betrayal over Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

Chamath experienced a direct impact of talent mobility and market speed when his 99-cent music download store at AOL, despite strong performance, was outmaneuvered by iTunes' launch of a similar store nine months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

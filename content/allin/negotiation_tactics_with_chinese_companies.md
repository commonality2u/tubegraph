Engaging in business in China necessitates a fundamental re-evaluation of established strategies. Entering the market with preconceived notions of success is ill-advised, as it often leads to unfavorable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Instead, a "first principles, bottoms up" approach is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Unique Aspects of [[Business challenges in China | Business in China]]

One common piece of advice when entering the Chinese market is to secure a 50/50 partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, questioning the rationale behind such requirements and, if unsupported, pursuing an independent, ground-up approach can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Initially, direct operations on the ground might experience fair treatment without bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### The "China War" Goes Global

A significant shift occurs when the "China war" extends beyond its borders, becoming a [[Global impacts of Chinese market entry | global phenomenon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The [[Chinese investment strategies | Chinese government]], through entities like sovereign wealth funds, may invest hundreds of millions or billions of dollars into global competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This strategy aims to deplete a company's resources, making it harder to [[Strategies for market competition in China | compete in China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. An example is Apple's mandated billion-dollar investment in DDI, which is uncharacteristic for Apple's investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Negotiation Strategies

When faced with this expanded competitive landscape, companies may need to adjust their objectives from aiming for gold to securing silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Leveraging Fear and Market Share

A key negotiation tactic, particularly when pursuing a deal like securing a 20% stake in a merged entity, involves creating leverage by instilling fear in the other party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This can involve:

*   **Aggressive Spending:** Pushing operational spend significantly to demonstrate financial firepower and a willingness to escalate competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For instance, burning $75 million a week during peak negotiation periods can create immense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Skyrocketing Market Share:** Simultaneously increasing market share can cause distress for the negotiating party, solidifying the leverage created by aggressive spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This approach is likened to a poker game, where the deal is only secured if the opposing side perceives a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

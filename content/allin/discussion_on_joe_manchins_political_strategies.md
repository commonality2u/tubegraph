Joe Manchin's political actions and potential future moves have been a significant topic of discussion, particularly regarding his stance on economic policies and his potential presidential aspirations.

## Stance on Economic Policy and Biden Administration
[[role_of_specific_political_figures_and_strategies | Joe Manchin]] gained attention for an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal, which addressed the Biden Administration's approach to cost control and alleged incompetence [00:02:06]. The article, titled "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act Betrayal," criticized the administration for subverting the law for ideological reasons instead of implementing it as intended [00:02:35]. It is speculated that Manchin himself was responsible for the article's provocative title [00:02:44].

Manchin's criticisms stem from his involvement in the "Inflation Reduction Act." Initially, he played a crucial role in stopping Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion "Build Back Better" bill, alongside Senator Kyrsten Sinema [00:04:27]. However, Manchin later compromised, allowing a $750 billion version of the bill to pass [00:04:33]. He is now complaining that the Biden Administration did not uphold its end of the bargain regarding deficit reduction, even though many commentators at the time deemed the bill's deficit reduction claims "preposterous" [00:04:44].

## Political Appeal and Future Prospects
Manchin is perceived as an "impressive" and "thoughtful" moderate [00:03:40]. His ability to be elected in West Virginia, a state considered a plus-20 Red State, highlights his capacity to appeal to the political center [00:05:10].

There has been speculation about [[role_of_specific_political_figures_and_strategies | Joe Manchin]] running for president [00:01:37]. The major challenge for him in a presidential bid would be securing the Democratic Party nomination, as his political positions are considered "far to the right" of the average Democratic voter [00:05:21].

### Potential for a Third-Party Run
Running as an independent candidate would be a significant "curveball" for the [[us_political_dynamics_and_trade_policies | US political dynamics]] [00:05:31]. However, some believe it's a "stretch" for him to pursue this path, noting that centrist or moderate candidates often struggle to secure a major party's nomination because they cannot appeal sufficiently to the party's base [00:05:38].

### Hypothetical Bipartisan Ticket
A particularly disruptive idea floated is a cross-party ticket, with a Democrat and a Republican merging to run [00:04:04]. The possibility of a "Manchin-Haley" or "Haley-Manchin" ticket has been raised as a potentially "disruptive idea in [[american_political_and_economic_strategies | American politics]]" [00:04:16].

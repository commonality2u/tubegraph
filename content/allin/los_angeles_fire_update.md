## Current Situation
An "absolute tragedy" is unfolding in Los Angeles, with a death toll currently at 25 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Approximately 25,000 structures, primarily homes, have been destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. The fires have affected 40,000 acres, equivalent to 60 square miles, which is larger than all of San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. The Palisades and Eaton fires are still burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, and as of Wednesday, 80,000 people were under evacuation orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. Friends of the podcast hosts have lost their homes, emphasizing the tragic loss of memories, documents, photos, and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

## Financial Impact
The estimated damage from the [[la_wildfire_disaster_and_its_causes | LA Wildfire Disaster]] is between $135 billion and $150 billion, making it "10 times more costly than any other wildfire in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. For context, the Camp Fire near Paradise, California, cost $12.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This scale of destruction in some of the "most expensive real estate on the planet" has prompted discussions about the recovery and rebuild efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

## California Leadership Response
California leadership, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass, has faced significant criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

### Executive Orders and Policies
Governor Newsom has issued executive orders to address the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>:
*   **Prohibiting Lowball Offers**: It is now illegal to make unsolicited offers to impacted homeowners for the next three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. This specifically applies to offers "less than the fair market value of the property" before the fire started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. This measure is time-boxed for three months and applies to specific zip codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Coastal Act Review**: Review of permits for houses along Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
*   **Price Gouging Protections**: Key price gouging protections have been extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Price gouging is defined as raising rent or prices of goods/services more than 10% from the last marketed price, potentially as little as 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. This applies to essential goods, emergency supplies, building materials, and housing-related services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
    *   Mayor Bass created a "snitch hotline" (LA 311) to report price gouging in rents, leading to public "naming and shaming" of platforms like Zillow and Redfin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. The free market is currently doubling rental home prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

### Debate on Policies
There is a debate regarding the effectiveness and impact of these policies:
*   **Against Intervention**: It is argued that price controls and non-solicitation rules challenge "appropriate market recovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. To attract builders, contractors, electricians, and plumbers to the LA area for rebuilding, the market must be allowed to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. An influx of service providers would increase supply and eventually normalize costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. The current rules disincentivize workers, potentially leading to homeowners waiting "six, seven years to get your home rebuilt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. The prohibition on unsolicited offers, even if for three months, removes liquidity and makes it harder for owners of burned-down lots to sell and relocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **For Limited Intervention**: The executive order on unsolicited offers is considered "somewhat reasonable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>, being hyper-specific to certain zip codes and time-boxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. This measure aims to prevent fraudulent activities, such as contractors posing as legitimate workers offering inflated prices or poor-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. It's suggested that the "cooling off period" benefits individuals in highly stressful situations, allowing them to make better decisions without pressure tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. While the free market is generally beneficial, during critical periods of high abuse, "checks and balances" are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

## Rebuilding Challenges
The indefinite price controls on services are particularly concerning, as there are not enough construction workers in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. Incentivizing workers from other states with premiums and bonuses is crucial for a rapid rebuild, similar to how Uber's surge pricing ensures availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

A comparison is drawn to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake response in California, where the I-10 freeway artery was rebuilt in "66 days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This was achieved by offering a "$200,000 per day early build bonus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>, demonstrating that "show me an incentive, I'll show you an outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. The current process, even with a six-month permit expectation, is deemed too slow given the state's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

Discussions also include incorporating new regulations for future building:
*   **Fireproof Construction**: Adding regulations for fireproof materials like stone-scaping, gravel, and non-overhang designs, and discouraging wood construction, could create "natural breaks" in wildfires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Temporary Housing**: Allowing people to park mobile homes for construction workers would be "super critical" for housing needs but is currently restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.

## Broader Context: National Wildfire Risk
The [[la_wildfire_disaster_and_its_causes | LA Wildfire Disaster]] highlights a larger trend across the United States.
*   **FEMA Disaster Risk**: FEMA data shows growing disaster risk on the Western Seaboard, with California and Florida being the two most complicated states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
*   **Wildfire Risk Across Western US**: CoreLogic data illustrates widespread wildfire risk across most of California, Nevada, Arizona, parts of Texas, and Washington, indicating a "multi-trillion dollar risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Value at Risk**: In California alone, $750 billion in value (1.26 million homes) is at moderate or great risk of fires. Other states like Colorado ($141 billion), Texas ($88 billion), Oregon ($45 billion), and Arizona ($36 billion) also face significant value at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This necessitates a national-level conversation and standardized building codes, rather than localized municipal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

*   **Congestion Pricing in New York**: New York City has implemented congestion pricing below Central Park, aiming to reduce traffic, noise, and air pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. Wait times have significantly decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This is seen as a positive innovation for cities to "reinvent" themselves and improve quality of life to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. The funds generated are allocated to public transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   **[[san_francisco_crime_and_safety_challenges | San Francisco Crime and Safety Challenges]]**: Concerns are raised about [[crime_and_security_in_american_cities | crime and security in American cities]] and their liveability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Ohio's Approach to Business**: Ohio's success in attracting companies like Palmer Lucky's new plant is highlighted as an example of a state that "pulls you in and speeds you up" through workforce availability and political cooperation, in contrast to states that "push you out and slow you down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. This demonstrates how states compete for elite companies with "willpower" and intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
*   **Urban Identity**: The debate between a city's desire for "progress and acceleration" versus maintaining a "small, quaint town" character is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. It's argued that many cities fail to deliver either outcome, resulting in "dysfunctional hellscapes" due to poor management and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
*   **Political Accountability**: The lack of operational experience of elected officials like Karen Bass is criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. Rick Caruso, a real estate developer who built the Pacific Palisades Village, proactively hired water trucks and firefighters to protect his development during the fire, while Mayor Bass was in Ghana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. Calls are made to recall unqualified politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

The **Launch of Threads by Meta and its impact on social media** marks a significant development in the social media landscape. Threads, a new application developed by Instagram, aims to directly compete with [[social_media_platform_x_and_its_evolution | Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Threads Overview
Developed by a team of approximately 20 people over six to nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, Threads launched with remarkable speed. Mark Zuckerberg announced 30 million downloads overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, with projections to reach 100 million users rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. The application is described as a "clone" of [[social_media_platform_x_and_its_evolution | Twitter]], bearing striking similarities in features and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

A key factor in its rapid adoption is the one-click sign-up flow from Instagram, allowing users to easily port over their bio, data, and social graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Initial user sentiment suggests Threads feels "snappier, faster, lower hurdle" and "more fun and social," encouraging less "considered" posts compared to [[social_media_platform_x_and_its_evolution | Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[01:15:13]</a>. It is anticipated to orient more towards entertainment, culture, and fun topics, distinct from [[social_media_platform_x_and_its_evolution | Twitter]]'s focus on politics and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[01:15:42]</a>.

## Meta's Strategic Vision
Meta's internal culture, characterized by flattening the organization and speeding up development, is seen as contributing to Threads' swift launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. The company aims for greater "velocity and cycle time" in its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Leaders like Adam Mosseri and Mark Zuckerberg have been actively engaging with users on Threads, responding to feedback in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

A significant strategic element for Meta is data collection. While Facebook is strong in video and pictures, it is "light on text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. In an era where "words" are crucial for training AI models, Threads offers an opportunity to collect extensive text data, conversations, and user sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. This aligns with Meta's future plans for massive launches on the AI side of the business, including support for their open LLM (Large Language Model) and the introduction of AI agents on WhatsApp and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

## Economic Impact
If Threads reaches 100 million users, its monetization potential is estimated to generate around $2.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 to $1.5 billion in EBIT, potentially adding an estimated $20 billion to Meta's Enterprise Value, all developed by a small team over a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Skepticism
Historically, social networks like Friendster, Myspace, and early Facebook initially focused on conversational systems but saw usage shift towards photos and later video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Threads represents a "reversion back to the origin" of text-based conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

However, some experts express skepticism about Threads' long-term success. They argue that successful category winners in social media, like Facebook with photo tagging and the news feed, or TikTok with its unique use case, "invented something de novo that nobody else had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:16]</a>, rather than merely copying existing features. While Meta successfully copied features like Reels (from TikTok) and Stories (from Snapchat) into existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>, creating a wholly new, carbon-copy product is seen as a different challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

The initial sign-ups are viewed as driven by curiosity and the ease of connecting through Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[01:14:01]</a>. The true test for Threads will be its ability to foster "habit forming behavior" and sustain daily usage, rather than just gaining sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[01:14:17]</a>. The argument is made that while Threads may be an "offensive blow" to [[social_media_platform_x_and_its_evolution | Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[01:17:06]</a>, its success will depend on engagement and potentially finding a unique value proposition beyond simply being a copycat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[01:16:31]</a>. If Threads were integrated directly into Instagram, it might pose a greater threat to [[social_media_platform_x_and_its_evolution | Twitter]] than as a standalone product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[01:12:55]</a>. The brand [[impact_of_twitter_acquisition_by_elon_musk | impact of Twitter acquisition by Elon Musk]] may also play a role in user migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[01:16:43]</a>.

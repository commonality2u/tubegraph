The United States faces a significant challenge in its self-sufficiency, particularly concerning critical supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. There is a concern that the nation is not in a position to produce its own necessary resources, leading to a [[economic_dependency_concerns_with_china | dependence on external entities]] whose perspectives on the U.S. can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Critical Areas for Protection

To safeguard its interests, the U.S. needs to measure and protect four critical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:

1.  **Technology:** This includes both chips and the enabling technologies for artificial intelligence, requiring a robust, largely American supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
2.  **Energy:** The U.S. lacks the capability to quickly produce the energy it needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
3.  **Critical Material Inputs:** These materials drive future material science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The nation faces a problem with [[dependence_on_critical_materials_and_rare_earths | critical minerals and rare earths]] inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
4.  **Pharma APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients):** Ensuring the ability to make, design, and manufacture these is crucial when American citizens fall ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Energy Dependency

A key concern within the [[us_energy_and_nuclear_infrastructure | energy sector]] is the nation's reliance on external supply chains. Specifically, critical supply chains related to photovoltaics (solar panels) can be shut off by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This highlights a need for [[improvements_and_challenges_in_energy_production_especially_nuclear_and_solar | improvements in energy production capabilities]] and a more resilient [[energy_policy_and_innovation | energy policy]] to ensure self-sufficiency.

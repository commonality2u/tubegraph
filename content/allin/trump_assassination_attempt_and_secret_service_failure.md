On July 13th, five days before episode 188 of the All-In Podcast was taped, an assassination attempt was made on former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This event sparked widespread discussion regarding the specifics of the incident, the performance of the Secret Service, and the broader implications of political rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## The Assassination Attempt

The incident occurred last Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. A 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight rounds from an AR-15 at former President Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. One bullet nicked Trump's right ear, a detail he later confirmed on Truth Social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Tragically, a Trump supporter in the crowd, Corey Comparator, was killed while protecting his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Two others were critically injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service's counter-sniper team 26 seconds after his first shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### The Shooter

Thomas Matthew Crooks did not have a criminal record and was not known to the FBI or Secret Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. He was a registered Republican but also donated $15 to a progressive PAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. His motive is not yet known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Leaks from a Senate briefing reported that Crooks wrote on July 13th on Steam, a gaming platform, "July 13th will be my Premiere, watch as it unfolds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. He reportedly had a second phone and a detonation device in his pocket, with an explosive device in his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Secret Service Failures and Incompetence

The incident raised serious questions about the Secret Service's security protocols and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Breakdown in Security

*   **Unsecured Rooftop**: The closest rooftop, 130 yards away, was not secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. The head of the Secret Service stated they didn't put anyone on the rooftop because of its sloped surface, a claim widely mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Photos indicate the White House roof is even more sloped but has Secret Service personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Timeline of Negligence**:
    *   **5:10 p.m.** Crooks was first identified as a Person of Interest (POI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
    *   **5:30 p.m.** He was spotted with a rangefinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
    *   **5:52 p.m.** He was spotted on a roof by the Secret Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   **6:02 p.m.** Trump took the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
    *   **6:12 p.m.** Crooks fired his first shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
    *   Despite being identified as a POI and seen with a rangefinder, ladder, and backpack, Crooks was never intercepted before Trump took the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Communication**: There was a "huge failure of communication" between the Secret Service and the Trump campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Fence Incident**: No agents were stationed at the fence, requiring an SUV to ram it to create passage for the Secret Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Delay in Evacuation**: There was a long delay in getting Trump into a car and to a hospital after the shots were fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **"Friendly" Theory**: It's speculated that snipers might have paused before shooting Crooks because they initially thought he was a friendly SWAT member, though Crooks was not in uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

### Calls for Accountability

The Secret Service's handling of the event has been described as "negligence and incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Critics highlight the lack of accountability, drawing parallels to the Afghanistan withdrawal where no one was fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

The Secret Service Director, Kimberly Cheatle, has been criticized for her statements, including the "sloped roof" excuse, and for allegedly being uncooperative with senators seeking answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Calls for her resignation have been made, arguing that the Secret Service cannot investigate itself, especially given past instances of deleting texts from [[january_6_pardon_controversies | January 6]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. A full, independent investigation is demanded, with agents testifying without fear of reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Contrast with Past Operations

Those familiar with Secret Service operations, including those who have hosted events for presidents, noted the stark contrast between this incident and the typical thoroughness observed. For example, during a dinner for President Trump, the Secret Service mapped out every angle, checked windows, and even inquired about steak knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Another anecdote described being detained for having two cell phones at a Clinton benefit, highlighting the usual meticulousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Trump's Response and Public Reaction

After being shot, Trump went down but quickly stood back up, facing the crowd and telling the Secret Service "wait, wait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. He then chanted "fight, fight, fight," which was met with a "palpable" sense of relief and chants of "USA USA USA" from the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. This defiant response was perceived as "courage that nobody can fake" and elevated Trump to "global legend" status, even leading to kids in Uganda reenacting the attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

Despite the perceived bravery, some questioned the Secret Service's decision to allow Trump to stand, given the potential for a second shooter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

## Political Rhetoric and its Impact

The assassination attempt ignited a debate about the role of political rhetoric in inciting violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

### Calls to Tone Down Rhetoric

Some argued that both Trump and Biden should issue a joint statement condemning violent language and disavow anyone on their teams who uses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. The argument suggests that mentally ill individuals might interpret violent political language differently, leading to tragic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

### Blame on Mainstream Media and Democrats

Others contended that the mainstream media has actively "amplified violent rhetoric" and "associated violent rhetoric with as a tolerable reaction" against Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. Examples cited include:
*   Peter Thiel's exchange with Reed Hoffman, where Hoffman reportedly said, "I wish I had turned him into an actual martyr" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.
*   A member of Jack Black's band allegedly stated, "that is too bad the shot missed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>.
*   President Biden's comment about putting Trump "in the bullseye" days before the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.
*   The continuous demonization of Trump as "Hitler," a "fascist," or a "threat to democracy" as a campaign strategy by Democrats and liberal media outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. This rhetoric, it's argued, could "poison the mind of someone who's already mentally Disturbed" into believing assassinating Trump would be a heroic act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.

### Counterarguments

It was acknowledged that JD Vance and other Republicans have also referred to Trump as "Hitler" or a "threat to democracy," though some argue this occurred years ago in private communications rather than as a systematic campaign strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. It's noted that "reasonable people can parse this and it is something that has occurred on both sides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>.

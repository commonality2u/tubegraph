From: [[allin]] <br/> 

Initial perceptions of Donald Trump by some political figures, including the speaker, were largely shaped by the [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]]'s filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, a reevaluation suggests that much of the [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]]'s narrative surrounding Trump has been misleading or outright fabricated, leading to a distorted public understanding of his character and policy effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Discrepancies in Portrayal vs. Reality

### Mental Acuity and Memory
Contrary to [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]] suggestions that Trump was not "fully with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, it is observed that he possesses an exceptional memory, recalling exact statements made about him years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Fabrications and Misinformation
A significant revelation for the speaker was realizing that many [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]] claims about Donald Trump were "straight up Fabrications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. An example cited is the widely reported assertion that Trump called white supremacists "very fine people" after Charlottesville, which is dismissed as a "total fabrication of the American Media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This highlights a concern that the [[media_coverage_and_bias | press]] might not be fundamentally trying to tell the truth, even in a biased way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Character and Motivations
The prevailing [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]] perception of Trump as "a deeply aggrieved guy who holds really terrible grudges" is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. In reality, while he remembers past comments, his primary focus is on how individuals can contribute to the country now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. His decision to select a former critic as his running mate further contradicts the narrative of him holding grudges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. It is argued that Trump is "much more motivated by the public interest" than by personal grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Policy Outcomes and Economic Impact
Beyond personal attributes, a reevaluation of Trump's presidency through economic data presents a different picture than often portrayed by the [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]]. A notable observation is that during his four years in office, workers' wages outpaced the growth of government size and corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This period stands out as unique compared to the previous decades where workers' wages were stagnant while corporate profits and government size increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This leads to the conclusion that Trump's policies "actually work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, prompting the speaker to admit their initial skepticism was "wrong about Donald Trump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> and that he was "the best president at least in a generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Political Discourse
The consistent focus on specific events, such as January 6th, by the [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]], rather than on substantive policy discussions, is highlighted as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This selective reporting is seen as contributing to a divided [[political_discourse_and_public_perception_in_America | political discourse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Ultimately, it is suggested that the [[media_coverage_and_bias | media]] often fails to convey the truth about [[trumps_engagement_with_media_and_challenges_at_the_nabj | Donald Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a> and that he is deeply attentive to public policy details and their impact on the economy and Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.

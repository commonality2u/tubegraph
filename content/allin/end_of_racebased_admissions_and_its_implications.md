The [[supreme_court_decision_on_affirmative_action | Supreme Court decision on Affirmative Action]] has led to significant shifts in university admissions, notably at MIT, prompting discussions on meritocracy and the purpose of higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## MIT Data Post-Decision

Following the [[supreme_court_decision_on_affirmative_action | Supreme Court decision on Affirmative Action]], MIT released data showing changes in its student body composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   Asian-American enrollment increased from 41% to 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   These gains corresponded to a decline in the percentage of Black and Latino students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   This shift is widely interpreted as a move towards a meritocracy in admissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

## Meritocracy and Admissions Criteria

Proponents of the shift argue that admissions should be color-blind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on Merit**: The belief is that genetics or "accidents of birth" should not determine access to education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, but rather hard work and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Ending Discrimination**: The previous affirmative action regime was seen by some as unfairly discriminating against Asian-Americans by engineering class proportions, forcing some students to lose out on opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The [[supreme_court_decision_on_affirmative_action | Supreme Court decision on Affirmative Action]] aimed to fix this form of discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

### Socioeconomic Background vs. Race

While race-based admissions are out, there's discussion about the role of socioeconomic background:
*   **Socioeconomic Disadvantage**: Some argue that students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds should receive a "leg up" in admissions, independent of race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   **Raw Talent**: A student achieving a 1400 SAT score from a dangerous inner-city or rural district with limited educational resources might possess more "raw talent" than a student with a 1450 from a privileged background with tutors and excellent schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Race as a Heuristic**: Race has sometimes been used as a heuristic for conditional background, but it's not always indicative of socioeconomic disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Incorporating socioeconomic background directly into the application process is seen as more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

## Critique of the [[higher_education_system_critique_and_student_loan_issues | Higher Education System]]

Beyond admissions criteria, there's a broader critique of the existing [[higher_education_system_critique_and_student_loan_issues | Higher education system critique and student loan issues]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **"Credentialism"**: Some argue that schools like Harvard are primarily "pure credentials" rather than places for specific specializations like MIT or Caltech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Valuing Skills**: The system often fails to adequately value "fundamentally important skills" needed for humanity's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Elitist Culture**: There's a call to break the "elitist culture" around certain schools that cost exorbitant amounts (e.g., $60-80,000 a year) and falsely claim to graduate the "best kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **DEI Ideology**: Some "top schools" are seen as "infected with the whole woke DEI ideology," which may hinder genuine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. These are often described as not being "top schools" anymore, lacking the smartest or hardest-working students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This links to the broader [[trump_vs_harvard_and_the_dei_controversy | Trump vs Harvard and the DEI controversy]] context.
*   **Non-Traditional Schools**: Employers are encouraged to hire from a wider range of schools, including non-traditional institutions, where students may be "hungrier" and more "earnest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. Programs like co-ops (e.g., University of Waterloo) are lauded for providing valuable hands-on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Decoupled Performance**: College or university affiliation is increasingly seen as decoupled from actual workplace performance and ability to succeed in a meritocratic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. Students from highly credentialed schools may struggle more with failure in the real world compared to those who faced challenges earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **Commoditized Education**: Core education is largely commoditized in the digital era, with many high-quality courses available for free online (e.g., MIT's macroeconomics course) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. Hands-on experience, often through internships or integrated programs, makes a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

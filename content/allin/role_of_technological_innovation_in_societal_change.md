Technological change is identified as one of the five major drivers observed in the cycles of nations' rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Throughout history, advancements in productivity have been significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

## Historical Context
History demonstrates a clear link between education and innovation. Better education typically leads to increased innovation and [[Future of technology in economic growth and innovation | technology development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This then, with a lag, contributes to the establishment of a currency as a reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

A classic example of an era with significant technological advancements is the late 1920s in the United States, which saw a high number of inventions and patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

## Modern Day and Future Outlook
Despite other societal challenges, the United States is currently recognized for its strong capacity for [[Future of technology in economic growth and innovation | technological innovation]], particularly with recent breakthroughs in [[AI advancements and the impact on technology and society | AI]] and large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. However, this strength in innovation alone may not be sufficient to overcome other systemic issues if they remain unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

### Dual Nature of Technology
New technologies present a dual potential: they can be utilized for productivity and societal benefit, or they can be developed into weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This highlights [[Technological advancements and ethical considerations | ethical considerations]] inherent in technological progress. This dual nature means technology can provide the "greatest miracle" but also act as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

### Societal Impact and Challenges
The advent of new technologies necessitates a "reorganization" of how wealth and opportunities are distributed within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. While technology can create abundance, such as in energy or food, conflicts may shift from fighting over resources to social issues, beliefs, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. The next five years are anticipated to bring "radical technology changes" alongside other global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

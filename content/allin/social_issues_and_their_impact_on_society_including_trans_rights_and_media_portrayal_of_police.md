## The Shift to Independent Media and [[cancel_culture_and_its_impact_on_media_professionals | Cancel Culture]]

Megan Kelly's departure from NBC and Fox News led her to become an independent broadcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This transition has significantly impacted her perspective on [[cancel_culture_and_its_impact_on_media_professionals | cancel culture]]. Kelly states she is "so much happier" as an independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, viewing [[cancel_culture_and_its_impact_on_media_professionals | cancel culture]] as a force that "separates individuals from companies where they do not belong" due to misaligned values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. She found working for large networks like NBC or Fox News challenging, especially regarding the need to conform to their rules on "dicey issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Her independent show, primarily on YouTube, has achieved significant reach, with Kelly claiming to be the largest broadcaster in the news category on the platform, surpassing channels like CNN and Fox in YouTube audience engagement with a much smaller team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. She reflects on the "disgusting and toxic and awful" nature of the news industry, which she believes stimulates outrage for profit and pushes specific agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Her motivation to return to broadcasting came from a desire to stand up against what she perceived as bullying and to "say what I know is true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## [[media_coverage_and_bias | Media Portrayal of Police]]

A key issue that motivates Megan Kelly is the portrayal of police officers in the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. With a brother who is a retired police lieutenant, she expresses frustration over "the lies that have been told about cops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. She acknowledges that while there are "few bad apples," they are "so not representative of your average police officer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Kelly highlights that police officers risk their lives for little pay and glory, yet are often "treated like absolute" by the news media, which she claims ruins their lives "before any due process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This perceived lack of due process in media coverage extends to other individuals accused of wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Transgender Issues and Gender Identity

Kelly has been particularly vocal on issues surrounding transgender rights, especially concerning children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Her position, despite being labeled a "bigot" or "Turf," is that "men cannot become women period" and "women can't become men either" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. She asserts that "men and boys do not belong in women's spaces" such as bathrooms, locker rooms, or sports events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Kelly argues that allowing individuals who are "genuinely struggling" with gender identity into women's spaces can lead to exploitation by "openly bad actors," citing examples of harm and humiliation to women, such as the case of Riley Gaines and Leah Thomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. She states she will "fight to my dying day against that," while clarifying she does not judge "trans people themselves" for what they do in private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, she draws a line when it impacts women's or children's spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

She dismisses criticism, particularly from men "posing as women," as an attempt to "shame me out of standing up for my daughter and myself and my fellow women on our safe spaces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Kelly expresses strong concern about biological males in women's healthcare spaces like mammogram offices or OBGYN clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Kelly believes the explosion of transgender identification, particularly among young people, is a "social contagion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. She cites sources like Abigail Shrier's book *Irreversible Damage* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. She notes that this phenomenon is more concentrated in "more leftist States cities regions," suggesting it is linked to exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. She compares it to anorexia, highlighting that while pro-anorexia content is censored online, videos promoting "top surgery" for young girls are readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

She expresses concern that autistic children or those on the spectrum, prone to obsessive thinking, can fall into "rabbit holes" online leading to obsessive thoughts and behaviors related to gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Kelly criticizes the medical community's "affirm" standard, which she believes discourages exploring underlying issues like divorce, poor grades, or sexual assault, which she claims are often the case for young girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. She warns about the high likelihood of sterilization for children receiving puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Furthermore, she condemns schools for hiding a child's gender transition from parents who may not be "on the affirm board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, calling this practice "grooming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## [[political_discourse_and_public_perception_in_America | Political Discourse]] and the Future of America

Kelly also discusses the broader [[political_discourse_and_public_perception_in_America | political discourse]] and the state of the country. She expresses difficulty understanding why anyone would vote Democrat currently, though she notes she is a registered independent who has voted equally for both parties in presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Regarding the 2024 presidential election, Kelly believes Donald Trump is "better positioned to win than he's ever been" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. She references polling data, such as a New York Times/Sienna poll showing Trump up one point, compared to Biden being up nine points at a similar time four years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. She notes that historically, Democrats often need a lead of four points or more in national polling to win due to the concentration of blue votes in urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

She contrasts Trump's 2016 campaign, where he was seen as a "genuine Outsider," "vibrant, feisty, fiery, fun," and "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, with his current status. While he has lost some of the "outsider" appeal and is older, he still possesses significant energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. His key advantage now is his "record," allowing him to highlight his past policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Kelly acknowledges that while his policies were "incredibly good for America," his rhetoric is often "divisive, toxic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

She offers a critical assessment of Kamala Harris, stating she is "not smart," "not a deep thinker," and "very surface level," often resorting to giggling as a "cover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. She criticizes the interview given by Harris with CNN's Dana Bash, arguing Bash "did terribly" by failing to press Harris with follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

Kelly also discusses the legal challenges facing Donald Trump. She believes the current cases against him are politically motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. She argues that the E. Jean Carroll civil case and the fraud trial brought by Letitia James in New York were biased, citing New York's strong Democratic leanings and the perceived lack of victims in the fraud case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. She criticizes Alvin Bragg, the George Soros-funded prosecutor, for selectively targeting Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. She also questions the Georgia case due to the conduct of Fanny Willis and Nathan Wade, and the January 6th cases due to Judge Chutkan's perceived bias and the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. She believes Trump will ultimately win on appeal in these cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

### The State of Politics and Society
Kelly expresses pessimism about the current state of politics, stating that politicians are "getting worse" due to influences like Instagram and a focus on being "congressional Kardashians" rather than serving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. She suggests that the incentives to be "a good person" in Washington D.C. are "gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. She finds few politicians to admire, mentioning Rand Paul as someone who stands up for "the right issues and seem to have some integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. She laments the loss of compromise and the increased focus on reelection driven by big money in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

Kelly advocates for a return to the original founding version of the country, with "government as small as possible" and politicians doing "as little as humanly possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. She believes societal change needs to be "bottom up" rather than through constitutional amendments, addressing issues like division, disconnection, loneliness, and the potential negative impact of processed foods on behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of community, face-to-face interaction, limiting screen time for children, connecting with nature, and fostering a renewed love for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. She cites an anecdote about her son being told by an "old cowboy" to stand for the national anthem at a rodeo as an example of the "more of that" type of community expectation needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. She calls for a return to neighborly acts of kindness and support, which she believes are being lost as people retreat into devices and television screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

[[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]] has acquired the cloud security company Wiz for $32 billion in cash, marking the largest deal in [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google's]] history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This acquisition is seen as a "starters pistol" for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

## About Wiz

Wiz provides security services that operate across multiple cloud platforms, including Microsoft's Azure, Amazon Web Services, [[googles_infrastructure_and_technological_innovations | Google's Cloud]], and Oracle Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. The company demonstrated significant growth, going from zero to $100 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in just 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Last year, Wiz's ARR passed $500 million, and it is projected to hit $1 billion in ARR this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

The acquisition price represents roughly 60 times their current run rate, or 30-32 times their forward-looking projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Prior Acquisition Offer and Breakup Fee
Wiz had previously turned down a $23 billion offer from [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]], citing desires to IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. Reports now suggest that the rejection was due to [[googles_antitrust_case_and_potential_breakups | antitrust concerns]] under the Biden administration and in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.

The current deal includes a substantial breakup fee of $3.2 billion in cash, which [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]] would pay to Wiz if the acquisition does not go through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. This fee is 10% of the deal size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

## Strategic Rationale for Google
The acquisition is seen as a strategic move for [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]], which has been lagging in the cloud market compared to Microsoft and Amazon, whose cloud revenues are around $100 billion per year, while [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google's Cloud]] revenue is approximately $40 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.

The deal employs a "beachhead" strategy, where acquiring Wiz allows [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]] to:
*   **Cross-sell**: Integrate Wiz's security product into its existing customer base and offer additional [[googles_infrastructure_and_technological_innovations | Google Cloud]] services to Wiz's customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   **"Trojan Horse" into other clouds**: Wiz's value comes from its multi-cloud capabilities across Azure, GCP, and AWS. This allows [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]] to gain customer traction and visibility into workloads in competing cloud environments, potentially pulling these workloads back to GCP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

Wiz's strength lies in its exceptional "taste" and design, making its product intuitive, beautiful, and well-integrated, which allows it to create significant value even in a market with other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

### Financial Implications for Google
With a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of approximately 30%, [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]] expects to generate about 30% of incremental profit per year from capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. To justify the $32 billion investment in Wiz, [[googles_acquisition_of_wiz | Google]] would need to generate an incremental $10 billion in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

## Impact on M&A Landscape
This acquisition suggests a shift in the M&A environment, possibly indicating a "Trump premium" where a more open-minded administration may be more permissive of tech M&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. Previous attempts at large tech acquisitions, like Adobe's acquisition of Figma, were blocked in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. The deal could also encourage companies to build goodwill by volunteering to develop software for the government, potentially easing regulatory scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

From a venture capital perspective, Wiz represents a "contrarian investment" as security was an underinvested category when the initial investment was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>. The acquisition is believed to be the largest exit ever in the security space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. It also highlights the strategy for VC firms to continue investing in high-growth outliers within their existing portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.

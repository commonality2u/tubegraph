Howard Lutnick, who began his career in New York, developed a friendship with Donald Trump when Lutnick was 30 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. At the time, Lutnick was the 30-year-old CEO of his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. His company was generating a million dollars daily, and he considered himself a "rich guy" due to having no personal or corporate debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

During this period, Lutnick frequently attended charity events on the "charity circuit" in New York, often accompanying his boss's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. His prior political engagement was limited to donating to New York candidates, like a younger Chuck Schumer, primarily to "get along" and maintain accessibility, rather than from a strong political drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. He had never spent more than two nights in Washington D.C. until Donald Trump's election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

## Impact of 9/11 and Reconstruction Efforts

The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, profoundly impacted Lutnick's life and business. His company occupied the top five floors of the World Trade Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. He lost 658 colleagues, including his brother Gary (36) and best friend Doug (39) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Twenty-seven people who attended his 40th birthday party that summer also died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

In the aftermath, Lutnick was driven to support the families of those who died, committing 25% of all his company's profits to their care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. He also maintained his friendship with Donald Trump, whom he describes as a "kind, sweet, good human being" during this difficult time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

Lutnick and his wife also provided significant personal support to military families at Bethesda Naval Hospital. While he would engage injured servicemen with music, his wife would assist their families by paying a year of their mortgage and expenses, understanding that parents often had to leave their jobs to be at their children's bedside during recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.

He credits Hillary Clinton, then a senator, for being "incredibly helpful" in New York's rebuilding efforts post-9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. He also leveraged his friendship with Bill Young, who ran House Appropriations, to secure aid for New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

## Transition to Political Engagement

Despite their long-standing friendship, Lutnick was not initially engaged in politics, focusing on rebuilding his company after 9/11 and through the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. He even contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 because of her post-9/11 assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. Donald Trump often "tortures" him good-naturedly for this past donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.

Lutnick's deeper involvement in politics began in October 2023 when Trump called him to ask for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Lutnick pledged $10 million and began actively participating in the campaign, researching and talking to Trump about various issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. He previously raised $15 million and gave $10 million to Trump's 2020 re-election campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

Lutnick describes his role as being dedicated to America, with no personal objective beyond helping the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. He was eventually tapped to lead Trump's transition efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

### Presidential Transition and Cabinet Selection

Lutnick studied the concept of presidential transition, specifically focusing on the role of the chief of staff, which he perceived as often functioning as a "gatekeeper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. He advised Trump to "fire the job" of gatekeeper and instead appoint a chief of staff who truly serves the president, suggesting Susie Wiles as ideal because "She lets him be him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

The transition team operated from a room at Mar-a-Lago with multiple large screens displaying candidate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:00">[29:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. The process involved presenting eight candidates for each position, with key resume highlights and 20-second speaking clips to assess their presentation skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>. Trump valued candidates who could effectively communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>. Lutnick states he recruited 150 top Republicans who, in turn, recommended more candidates, resulting in thousands of potential picks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>. He emphasizes that all candidates were vetted, but he didn't present negative information unless necessary, ensuring "every candidate... was the number one choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>. This efficient process allowed for rapid cabinet selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>.

## Doge and Financial Vision

Lutnick's major initiative, "Doge" (Department of Government Efficiency), aims to balance the U.S. budget by cutting waste and increasing revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. He estimates that 25% of the nearly $4 trillion in entitlements is waste, which amounts to $1 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. His plan also includes generating another trillion dollars in incremental revenue through tariffs and other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

A key part of the Doge plan is a proposal to eliminate income tax for individuals earning less than $150,000 per year, covering about 85% of Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. Trump reportedly agreed to this proposal if the budget could be balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

Lutnick recruited Elon Musk for this initiative. Musk suggested cutting 80% of the federal government, noting that only 450,000 of 5.9 million government employees are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>. Lutnick believes he can achieve a 50% cut legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>.

### Gratus Vendors and Technology Overhaul

Lutnick plans to utilize "gratus vendors"â€”approved vendors who donate products to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>. This bypasses lengthy government procurement processes for services like software development. If a company provides software to the President's office (Article Two), the President can accept it as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:27:00]</a>. He has convinced major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to build software for the U.S. government for free, believing it will benefit them by establishing a strong business model for international sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

This approach addresses the government's outdated technology, including reliance on COBOL mainframes from the 1970s, which is due to accounting rules that require upfront budgeting for 10-year software contracts, disincentivizing upgrades for administrations with shorter terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. Lutnick envisions using [[AI and job displacement | AI]] for efficient customs processing, including automated photo recognition and weighing to determine tariffs without manual inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

### Redefining GDP and Combating Fraud

Lutnick argues that non-productive government spending should not be counted in GDP, as it distorts economic figures. For example, spending on people "thinking about buying a tank" is not productive GDP, whereas actually making and buying a tank is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. He believes roughly 25% of current GDP is non-productive government spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, and notes suspicious spikes in government spending in the quarter before elections that artificially inflate GDP figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

He identifies systemic fraud in government payments, citing the example of $200 billion out of $1.2 trillion in PPP money going to Chinese fraud gangs by making up fake companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:58:00">[49:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. Lutnick asserts that fraudsters are the ones who "scream" the loudest when payments are stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:00">[41:55:00]</a>. He stresses that stopping such fraud will not impact essential payments like Social Security or Medicaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>.

### Tariffs and the [[American Dream and economic opportunities | American Dream]]

Lutnick champions the use of tariffs to rebalance global trade and support American industries. He explains that tariffs were central to America's prosperity before income tax was introduced in 1913 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>. He argues that post-World War II, the U.S. intentionally lowered its tariffs while allowing other nations to maintain high tariffs to facilitate their rebuilding, a strategy that has continued for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:26:00">[54:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a>. Kuwait, for instance, has the highest tariffs against the U.S. despite U.S. efforts to free it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:20:00">[55:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:31:00">[55:31:00]</a>.

He counters the argument that tariffs cause inflation by stating that inflation is primarily caused by printing more money, not by specific product price increases due to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. Instead, tariffs incentivize companies to bring production back to the U.S. (reshore), creating better-paying jobs and avoiding tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. As evidence, he points to $2 trillion in committed domestic production returning to the U.S. due to Trump's tariffs, including TSMC building semiconductor wafer plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

Lutnick connects trade policy to the [[American Dream and economic opportunities | American Dream]], arguing that free trade agreements like NAFTA hurt American workers by allowing corporations to seek cheap labor abroad, leading to despair and reduced life expectancy for the high school-educated workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:33:00">[59:33:00]</a>. He states that countries like India have average tariffs of 50%, compared to the U.S. average of four percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:00">[58:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:00">[58:12:00]</a>.

## Sovereign Wealth Fund and Trump Card

Lutnick proposes a sovereign wealth fund where the U.S. government, as the world's largest customer, would receive equity (warrants) in companies when making large purchases. He cites the example of the U.S. buying 2 billion COVID vaccines, which tripled Pfizer and Moderna's stock; a 20% warrant could have generated $50 billion for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. He plans to use this fund to strengthen the Social Security system and reduce national debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.

He also introduced the "Trump Card," a program to sell green cards for $5 million to wealthy non-U.S. citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. These individuals would not pay global income tax on their external earnings, only on U.S.-sourced income, while gaining the right to reside in America and potentially start businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. He estimates 37 million people worldwide are capable of buying such a card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:2:27">[01:12:27]</a>, and Trump believes a million could be sold, generating $5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. This revenue could significantly reduce the national debt and allow for further tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

## Addressing Tax Scams and Regulations

Lutnick aims to eliminate tax scams, such as cruise ships flying "flags of convenience" like Liberia to avoid U.S. taxes despite operating in American waters with American passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>. He also targets countries like Ireland, which recorded a $60 billion budget surplus due to U.S. tech and pharma companies housing their intellectual property there to exploit low tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.

He emphasizes smart, rather than restrictive, environmental policies. For example, he questions the practice of importing lithium mined messily abroad when it could be mined cleaner in Nevada, and other crucial resources exist within the U.S. but are not developed due to a lack of regulatory incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:44">[01:33:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>. He also critiques illogical regulations, such as administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns, which he attributes to government corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a>.

Howard Lutnick's career journey, from rebuilding his company after 9/11 to his current role in shaping economic policy, reflects a profound dedication to American prosperity and efficiency.

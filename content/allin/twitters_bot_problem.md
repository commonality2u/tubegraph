Elon Musk has expressed significant concerns regarding the number of bots and spam accounts on the [[Social media platforms and user dynamics | social media platform]], Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He describes the current situation as a "debate" on the true number of bots, which Twitter has stated is unknowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, "as unknowable as the human soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Estimating Bot Presence

Twitter claims that fewer than 5% of its daily active users are fake or spam accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Elon Musk, however, believes the actual number is likely at least four or five times that, with a lowest estimate of around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This estimate is supported by analyses from "quite smart outside firms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Musk highlights the discrepancy by comparing the reach of popular content to the claimed user base:
*   Twitter states it has 217 million "monetizable daily active users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Elon Musk's tweet about buying Coca-Cola to put cocaine back in it is cited as the most-liked tweet by any living human, with less than 5 million likes (around 4.7 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   This means the most popular tweet only reached about 2.5% of the claimed user base, or less than 2% for generally popular tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   He contrasts this with YouTube, which has billions of users, and its most popular videos garner "tens of billions of views," a ratio that "makes a lot more sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Musk's concern isn't just about a few percentage points but whether the bot presence could be as high as 80% or 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Impact on Advertising and Acquisition

The bot problem is "incredibly material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, especially since Twitter's revenue relies primarily on "brand advertising" (awareness advertising) rather than "click-through advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. For brand advertising, it's crucial that "real humans are seeing that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. If the reality of the bot situation becomes clear, Twitter's revenue would be "significantly impaired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

Twitter has reportedly refused to disclose the number of fake or spam accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>, claiming a complex methodology that only they can understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Musk emphasizes the need for an "objective way to assert the thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>, as this represents a "material misstatement" if the actual bot percentage is significantly higher than claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. He uses an analogy of buying a house: less than 5% termites is acceptable, but 90% termites is "not okay" and means it's "not the same house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

Musk states that his acquisition offer for Twitter was based on the "truth and accuracy of their public filings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. If these filings are inaccurate, he "can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. He believes the bot problem "should be a lot easier to get rid of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a> and that it's not "splitting the atom" or "getting to the moon" to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

There is speculation that Twitter might not want to look too closely at the bot numbers because they "might not like the answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, or perhaps they were simply "not paying enough attention" to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

## Vision for Twitter without Bots

A key goal for Twitter, whether through an acquisition or a new platform, is to get rid of bots, scams, and trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Musk envisions Twitter as a "public town square" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, a "digital town square" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a> that is spam-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>, where "important ideas are debated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. This requires it to be "maximally trusted and inclusive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. The ultimate goal is to have an app that is "incredibly useful and that people love using" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

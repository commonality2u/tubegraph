The All-In Podcast featured [[Interview dynamics and geopolitical insights from Tucker Carlsons Putin interview | Tucker Carlson]] as a guest, where he discussed various topics including his departure from Fox News, the state of American society, media control, immigration, and the current political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This appearance marked a significant moment for co-host David Sacks, fulfilling a "dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Background and Post-Fox News Career

[[Interview dynamics and geopolitical insights from Tucker Carlsons Putin interview | Tucker Carlson]] was described as the number one TV host for much of the past decade, including the year prior to his unexpected firing from [[Reasons for Tucker Carlsons firing from Fox News | Fox News]] on April 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The exact reason for his termination has never been officially stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, though Carlson speculated it might be due to his "unpopular" opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Despite being a top-rated and highly-paid host, he was not shocked by the firing, recognizing that challenging "everybody" in a corporate job is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. He maintains no hard feelings, acknowledging he worked "at the pleasure of the family that runs the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Since leaving Fox News, Carlson launched a show on X (formerly Twitter), having produced over 42 episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. His guests have included [[Trump vs Harvard and the DEI controversy | Donald Trump]], Andrew Tate, Dave Portnoy, and the newly elected president of Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. His mission as an independent journalist remains consistent: to speak what he believes is true, bring underreported information to a broader audience, and be honest, including admitting when he is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. His new show plans to expand internationally, covering global events and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

## Discussion Points

### Media Control and Advertiser Influence
Carlson stated that advertiser influence "defines news coverage, especially on Pharma" because pharmaceutical companies are the largest advertisers in television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. He asserted that if Pfizer is sponsoring a show, it's unlikely their vaccines will be questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While he personally was never directly told by management to avoid specific topics, he made it clear that his producers might have received such directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He maintained that he would only say what he believed to be true on air, even if it meant being taken off television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

Carlson noted that during his tenure at Fox, he took positions on the Ukraine war, COVID vaccine, COVID lockdowns, and January 6th that were unpopular within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. He suggested his views on these topics have since been "vindicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. The decision to fire a top performer without explanation was seen as "self-destructive" from a business perspective, as Fox's ratings "cratered in the wake" of his departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### State of American Society and National Cohesion
Carlson believes American society is struggling with national cohesion, characterized by a public conversation that reflects the "parochial concerns of a tiny tiny group of people" â€“ specifically, "middle-aged affluent women who tend to be very angry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. He cited examples like the focus on "trans black lives matter" as a public policy objective in a country with larger problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:05]</a>. He argued that the disproportionate influence of this class, driven by their "neurosis" and "weird personal ticks" from "years of therapy and SSRIs," controls the national conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

He stressed the importance of a shared "civic religion" that ties Americans together, lamenting the lack of broad agreement on "what it means to be an American" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. Without it, he fears the country cannot withstand an economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>. Carlson expressed concern that the left is attempting to rewrite American history, shifting the nation's founding from 1776 (Declaration of Independence) to 1619 (importation of slavery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. He called for emphasizing commonalities rather than inherent divisions to prevent "violent conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>.

### Critique of Elites and Modern Issues
Carlson observed that affluent, highly educated individuals in NGOs, government, and finance tend to dislike a certain brand of politics, particularly those who question why the country doesn't act in its own interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. He suggested that such individuals hear about the public's hatred for figures like him, creating pressure on employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

He put forth a "crackpot" theory that the core problem is "prosperity" itself, which over time leads people to "destroy themselves" and their societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:21:00">[35:21:00]</a>. He cited examples like rising diabetes rates with GDP, declining birth rates, and the increase in euthanasia in countries like Canada as signs of societal self-destruction driven by affluence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>. He linked the "climate crisis" narrative to a "gut level sense that we need to have less because this is killing us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>, although he questioned the human causation argument for global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.

Carlson noted that some of the richest people are "funding destruction," unlike previous generations of liberal wealthy individuals who supported public libraries or summer camps for poor children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>. He found it "weird" and a "contradiction" that "revolutionary politics" are being "imposed from above by some of the biggest winners in our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17:00">[48:17:00]</a>, citing historical parallels with the Bolshevik Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:34:00">[48:34:00]</a>. He also heavily criticized those with "massive inherited wealth," calling them "almost all horrible" as a class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:41:00">[50:41:00]</a>.

### Immigration Policy
Carlson advocates for a "rational immigration policy whose purpose is to help your country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:44:00">[56:44:00]</a>. He gave an example of his best friend's parents, Indian physicians who immigrated from Africa to rural Massachusetts, benefiting the town and themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:00">[56:55:00]</a>. However, he strongly criticized the current policy of "throwing open the doors to anyone who wants to come here from the poorest countries in the world at a scale that we can't possibly digest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>. He noted estimates of 60-70 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:00">[57:47:00]</a>. Carlson considers it "insane" for a government to "replace" its own people, especially when native birth rates are tanking and issues like fentanyl deaths and euthanasia are prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:34:00">[58:34:00]</a>. He views this as an "expression of loathing" for the existing population and a "dilution of their political power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:00">[59:00:00]</a>.

### Political Landscape
Carlson offered brief assessments of leading political figures:
*   **Joe Biden**: Believes Biden "can't be the nominee" and has "outlived his usefulness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.
*   **Nikki Haley**: Expressed bewilderment at her popularity, stating her views on war and economics are not popular with the public and resemble those of [[George W. Bush]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. He found Jamie Dimon's support for her "embarrassing" and out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.
*   **[[Reevaluating the medias portrayal of Donald Trump | Donald Trump]]**: Views Trump as the "indispensible figure" in the Republican party, without whom they would revert to "Bush republicanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. He believes [[Trumps engagement with media and challenges at the NABJ | Trump's]] surge in popularity was cemented in August 2022 when the FBI raided his house, calling it a "political prosecution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   **Vivek Ramaswamy**: While personally liking and admiring Vivek's intelligence and program, Carlson admitted confusion as to why he isn't polling better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
*   **RFK Jr.**: Carlson knows RFK Jr. well, considers him a "decent man and a principled person" and smart, but expressed less confidence in some of the people around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Gavin Newsom**: Carlson predicted Newsom would be the Democratic nominee, labeling him "by far the most evil person in the Democratic party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. He characterized Newsom as someone who can "say anything he needs to say" without showing guilt and can behave in ways most people cannot, like dining at French Laundry during COVID lockdowns while arresting surfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. Carlson implied Newsom is a "sociopath" and a "fascist," whose political culture is "utterly corrupt" and "authoritarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

### Media Landscape and Information Control
Carlson argued that despite the internet's promise of diverse and unfiltered information, there is now "less freedom in information than there was 30 years ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. He pointed to the media's unified narrative on issues like the Ukraine war, even when conflicting evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. He cited David Arakhamia's testimony about a potential peace deal early in the war, which was ignored by mainstream media because it contradicted the narrative that the war was not about NATO expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. Carlson highlighted X (formerly Twitter) as the "only platform at scale in the world that's pretty... not mass censorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>, and believes its continued freedom is crucial for a "real election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. He praised [[Elon Musk]] for his bluntness in telling advertisers to "go F*** yourself" when they tried to "blackmail" X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.

### Role of Technology and its Impact on Society
Carlson expressed concern about humanity's ability to "metabolize change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. He noted that while technologists thrive on "relentless change," most people cannot handle it, leading to societal breakdown if there isn't a period for things to "settle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. He drew a contrast with the Chinese perspective that change for its own sake is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Potential Vice Presidency
When asked if he would consider being [[Trump vs Harvard and the DEI controversy | Donald Trump's]] Vice President, Carlson stated he would "consider anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>. However, he believes people should "do what you are designed to do" and that hubris leads men to think they have more power than they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. Having never been involved in politics or consistently voted, he found the idea of running for national office at 54 somewhat absurd for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:37">[01:24:37]</a>. He prefers a "colorless, boring, non-charismatic" leader who can govern without making it about themselves and restore "rules-based order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>.

## Conclusion
Carlson concluded by emphasizing the critical need for a free and open exchange of information for a functional democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>. He hopes his new platform will contribute to adding more diverse information and analysis to the public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>.

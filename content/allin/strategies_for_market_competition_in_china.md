Engaging in [[business_challenges_in_china | doing business in China]] necessitates a complete re-evaluation of established business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Approaching the Chinese market with overconfidence often leads to failure, requiring a "first principles, bottoms up" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Entry Strategies

When first looking to [[business_challenges_in_china | enter China]], companies are often advised to secure a 50/50 local partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, questioning this common practice and opting to build operations independently on the ground can be a viable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Experience suggests that direct operations can lead to fair treatment without observed bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Navigating Globalized Competition

The competitive landscape in China can extend globally due to the actions of the [[chinese_investment_strategies | Chinese government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Entities like the [[chinese_investment_strategies | sovereign wealth of China]] (CIC) engage in [[chinese_investment_strategies | investing hundreds of millions and billions of dollars]] into competitors globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This strategy aims to deplete a company's financial resources, making it harder to [[business_challenges_in_china | compete in China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. An example of this is Apple's reported billion-dollar investment in DDI, a company Apple typically would not invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This phenomenon, dubbed the "[[global_impacts_of_chinese_market_entry | Chinese war went global]]," requires companies to shift strategic goals from "going for the gold" to securing "the silver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Negotiation and Market Share Tactics

When facing intense competition, such as with DD, a key strategy involves aggressive spending to create leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For instance, burning $75 million a week at the peak of negotiations can induce fear in a competitor, ensuring a deal is secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This approach, likened to a game of poker, can lead to skyrocketing market share during negotiations, effectively putting pressure on the opposing party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This aggressive negotiation strategy is crucial to [[negotiation_tactics_with_chinese_companies | get a deal done in China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

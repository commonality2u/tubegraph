## Ukraine's Counter-Invasion into Russia
According to David Sacks, the current fighting is concentrated in the Donbas region and along a 1,200-kilometer front within Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>. Russia possesses superior numbers in soldiers, artillery, and air power, leading to significant Ukrainian casualties, estimated between 30,000 and 60,000 per month, which Sacks describes as unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>.

Ukrainian President Zelensky's strategy included a "Hail Mary" attack on an undefended part of Russia, specifically Kursk, utilizing some of Ukraine's best forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:45]</a>. While this action gained a few hundred miles of undefended territory, Sacks views it as strategically unimportant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. He suggests that Russian air power is causing significant casualties among these forces, which are now disoriented and seeking defensive positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>. Sacks interprets this move as a public relations offensive rather than a strategic game-changer, predicting that Ukraine's position is unsustainable and will eventually collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>.

## Nord Stream Pipeline Incident
The discussion also touched upon the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, with ongoing skepticism about the official explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>.

David Sacks finds previous explanations, such as Russia destroying its own pipeline or a single individual acting from a yacht, to be implausible given the pipeline's robust structure and the expertise required for underwater demolition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:27">[01:36:27]</a>. He notes that the story about a small rented yacht with a six-member crew, including trained civilian divers, having executed the operation, costing around $300,000, has been circulating for several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:02">[01:37:02]</a>. Sacks remains skeptical that this was within Ukraine's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>.

He points to statements made by U.S. officials, including President Biden's pledge to "bring an end to the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline" if Russia invaded Ukraine, and Victoria Nuland's warning that Nord Stream 2 would not move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>. These statements, coupled with the U.S.'s known capabilities, lead Sacks to believe that the U.S. was involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>.

In contrast, Jason Calacanis cites facts about the depth of the pipeline (260 feet), suggesting that such a dive is "easily accomplished" with minimal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>. He argues that given Ukraine's defense against Russia, it is "ridiculous" to suggest they couldn't execute such a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.

## U.S. Involvement and Foreign Policy
The discussion also touches on the broader context of [[ukrainerussia_conflict_and_us_foreign_policy | U.S. foreign policy]] regarding the conflict.

David Sacks asserts that he would prefer to see America "stay out of other people's wars" and pursue peace deals, rather than taking sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:14">[01:42:14]</a>. Jason Calacanis, however, expresses a preference for "democracies beating autocracies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>.

[[US foreign policy and its international impact | US foreign policy and its international impact]] and global relations are shaped by a variety of factors, including economic strategies, international agreements, and responses to global conflicts.

## Economic Strategies and Global Influence

### Tariffs and Trade
Tariffs are viewed as tools for both economic and political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. They provide leverage over countries on issues beyond just economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. A "reciprocal trade act" is proposed, suggesting that if a country like China charges a 100% tariff on a car, the US should apply the same tariff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Large tariffs were imposed on Chinese cars, which had a positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The European Union is cited as an example of a region with a trade deficit with the US, as they often do not want American farm products or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Larry Summers' concern that tax cuts coupled with tariffs could lead to "the mother of all stagflation" (inflation due to tariffs and economic decline) is acknowledged, with respect for Summers' past accurate predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Global Role of the US Dollar
There is concern about the US dollar losing its global power as countries move away from it, which could be equivalent to losing a war and make the US "third world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Countries like Russia, China, Iran, and even Saudi Arabia are noted to be engaging in transactions with other currencies instead of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Tariffs are seen as a way to prevent this decline in dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Deficit and Spending
Addressing the national deficit is crucial. A primary strategy involves economic growth, particularly by leveraging abundant US oil and gas resources, which are seen as "Liquid Gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Efficiency in spending and reducing wasteful government bureaucracy are also highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Education funding, for example, is proposed to be decentralized to states, with the federal Department of Education being significantly reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Environmental regulation is also suggested to be controlled more by states than a large federal bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## International Conflicts and Relations

### [[ukrainerussia_conflict_and_us_foreign_policy | Ukraine-Russia Conflict]]
The conflict in Ukraine would not have happened if the previous administration was in power, due to oil prices being lower and the absence of specific rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. The US has contributed significantly more financial aid to Ukraine than Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. A key factor in the war's origin is believed to be the discussion around Ukraine entering NATO, which has long been understood as a "no no" for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. The current administration's rhetoric, including suggestions of putting nuclear weapons in Ukraine, is considered provocative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

No American boots on the ground would be deployed in Ukraine, distinguishing the US from closer neighbors like France or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Ukraine is reported to be running out of soldiers, relying on older or less equipped individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

### Israel-Palestine Conflict
The October 7th attack on Israel is seen as a consequence of Iran having financial resources, which they lacked under the previous administration's sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. The Abraham Accords are highlighted as a significant achievement in promoting peace in the Middle East, with the potential for Iran to eventually join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. The primary goal regarding Iran is to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

### China Relations
War with China is considered "unlikely" if the "right president" is in office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Peaceful coexistence and competition are desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. COVID-19's origin in the Wuhan lab is attributed to China, causing millions of deaths and trillions in economic damage globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. US funding for gain-of-function research in China was stopped due to concerns about providing money to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

## International Organizations and Alliances

### World Health Organization (WHO)
The US contributed significantly more to the WHO ($500 million) than China ($39 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. Withdrawal from the WHO occurred due to its perceived ineffectiveness and misguidance during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Despite offers to re-join at a lower cost, the US re-entered under the current administration at an even higher contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. The WHO is believed to be "totally controls" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

### Paris Agreement
The Paris Accord was deemed a "disaster" for the US due to disproportionate financial contributions, with the US paying a trillion dollars while other countries like Russia and China paid nothing or had delayed obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>. Withdrawal was implemented due to its unfairness, a decision that was popular with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. The US subsequently re-entered the agreement under the current administration on worse terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

## Border Security and Immigration
The construction of hundreds of miles of border wall was completed according to Border Patrol specifications, including features for vision and climb resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. The "Remain in Mexico" policy was considered a "big deal" for effective border control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. The current administration is criticized for leaving gaps in the wall, selling materials for scrap, and repealing executive orders, which is seen as a deliberate move towards "open borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. The current border situation is described as an "invasion" involving people from jails, mental institutions, and terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

Regarding high-skilled immigration, support is expressed for automatically granting green cards to graduates of US colleges, including junior colleges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. This policy aims to retain brilliant individuals who often return to their home countries (e.g., India, China) to start companies that could have been established in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

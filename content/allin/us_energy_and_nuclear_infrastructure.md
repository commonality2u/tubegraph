## The Energy Race: US vs. China

The United States is currently in an "energy race" with China, a reframing of the "green energy race" by new Treasury Secretary Scott Besson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. This competition is crucial given the foundational role of electricity in powering modern advancements like AI and automation, which are critical factors for future economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>.

### Current Disadvantages and Challenges

The [[United States energy supply chain challenges | United States energy supply chain challenges]] currently faces significant disadvantages in this race:
*   **Cost of Electricity** Americans pay roughly 1.5 to 3 times more per kilowatt-hour for electricity than China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>.
*   **Production Capacity** The U.S. has approximately half of China's electricity production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:25:00">[57:25:00]</a>.
*   **Cost to Add Capacity** The cost to add new gigawatts of production capacity in China is significantly lower, ranging from 1/10th to 1/2 of the cost in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:30:00">[57:30:00]</a>.

Historically, the U.S. disinvested in its power grid for a long period, especially since 2000, due to de-industrialization and the outsourcing of manufacturing, leading to a decreased need for additional electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:26:00">[1:26:00]</a>. Conversely, [[Chinas nuclear energy buildout | China has ramped up its capacity significantly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:10">[1:27:10]</a>. For example, since 1985, the net additions in electricity capacity in China are almost 7x that of the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:17">[1:27:17]</a>. In 2000, both countries had roughly 1,000 terawatt-hours of capacity; today, the U.S. has 1,600 terawatt-hours, while China boasts 9,000 terawatt-hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:29">[1:27:29]</a>.

## The Role of Nuclear Energy

To catch up and ensure energy security, particularly for burgeoning AI infrastructure like the Stargate project (a new company intending to invest $500 billion over four years in AI infrastructure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:00">[1:10:00]</a>, a substantial increase in [[Nuclear Energy and Small Modular Reactors | nuclear energy]] is deemed essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:00">[1:27:00]</a>.

### Nuclear Capacity and Technology

The U.S. nuclear capacity has remained relatively flat for over 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:30:05">[1:30:05]</a>. In contrast, China has significantly increased its nuclear capacity over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:30:27">[1:30:27]</a>. France, for example, generates over 70% of its electricity from nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:32:02">[1:32:02]</a>.

New, safer nuclear technologies, such as Gen 4 reactors and pebble-bed reactors, are now available and in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:30:57">[1:30:57]</a>. These designs are touted as "meltdown-proof," eliminating the risk of runaway heat and radioactive material release seen in older designs like Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:30:57">[1:30:57]</a>. China is rapidly deploying dozens or hundreds of these new systems, while the U.S. is deploying zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:31:28">[1:31:28]</a>.

### Policies and Solutions

The shift in [[Energy policy and innovation | energy policy]] under the new administration aims to accelerate power plant permitting on federal lands to meet AI data center demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:28:01">[1:28:01]</a>. This includes a broad approach to energy generation, rather than restrictive conditions based on source type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:28:13">[1:28:13]</a>.

The primary obstacle to increasing U.S. nuclear capacity is regulatory challenges and roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:32:56">[1:32:56]</a>. Experts suggest that emergency actions may be necessary to remove these regulatory impediments, considering the issue a national security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:33:35">[1:33:35]</a>. There is sufficient intellectual capital in the U.S. eager to advance nuclear buildout, but they are hindered by these regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:33:16">[1:33:16]</a>.

A potential downside to rapid deregulation and construction is the time required to build these facilities safely and properly, as the U.S. lacks recent practice in large-scale, accelerated construction of power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:35:01">[1:35:01]</a>.

Companies like Constellation Energy (CEG) are already signing direct deals with large tech companies (e.g., Amazon, Microsoft) and even federal agencies to provide direct energy access, indicating a growing acknowledgment that nuclear power is the best path forward for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:28:56">[1:28:56]</a>. This trend is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:29:48">[1:29:48]</a>.

The ability to build a robust power base is critical for national security and to ensure the U.S. remains competitive in areas like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:36:11">[1:36:11]</a>. Without sufficient power capacity, China's larger industrial AI capacity could eventually overshadow U.S. advantages in advanced GPU technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:35:54">[1:35:54]</a>.

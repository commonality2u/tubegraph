Recent events involving classified documents found in the possession of past and current U.S. presidents highlight a systemic issue within the American government regarding the classification of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. With Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton all having been ensnared in classified document controversies, a re-evaluation of the current classification system is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

## The Overclassification Argument

There is a growing concern that the U.S. government is overclassifying documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>.
*   **Government Accountability:** Since the passage of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the government can avoid accountability and public scrutiny by simply labeling any document as classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:58">[01:12:58]</a>. This has led to an "overclassification problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Default Classification:** It appears that almost everything handed to a president or vice president is now classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
*   **Lack of Declassification:** The U.S. government rarely declassifies anything, with records from events like the Kennedy assassination still classified decades later due to agencies like the CIA "filibustering" their release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>. It is argued that most documents do not need to remain classified after five years, and an automatic declassification process should be considered unless a document is actively reclassified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.
    *   In business, very few documents remain sensitive or trade secrets five or even twenty years later, in contrast to government practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

### Specific Instances
*   **Biden's Documents:** President Biden's classified documents were found in various locations, including an office, a library, and his garage (which was locked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. A special counsel, Robert Hur, has been appointed to investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. Questions include why they were moved, what they pertain to, and if they relate to the Biden family's business dealings in Ukraine and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.
*   **Trump's Documents:** Donald Trump's documents at Mar-a-Lago were locked in a basement, which the FBI initially seemed okay with before changing their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.
*   **Commonalities:** Both Biden's and Trump's documents were mixed with personal effects and mementos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. The argument is that if one works in government, nearly all handled documents are classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.

## Implications and Consequences

The pervasive issue of overclassification has several significant implications:

*   **Hindrance to Elected Officials:** The current system creates extreme disincentives for politicians to operate normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
    *   Politicians are discouraged from using email due to past controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.
    *   They are advised to "never touch a document" or accept one handed to them, instead requiring access in secure "clean rooms" without notes or cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.
    *   This makes it "impossible for them to act like normal people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.
*   **Benefit to "Permanent Government":** This system primarily benefits "Insiders," or the "permanent government" (also referred to as the "Deep State"), by enabling them to control information and marginalize elected officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.
*   **Political Tool and Hyper-Partisanship:** The classified document issue has become a tool for hyper-partisanship, with both sides attacking each other for the same perceived offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.
*   **Discourages Public Service:** The intense scrutiny and legal complexities surrounding government service discourage qualified individuals from entering politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. Business professionals' past dealings are investigated, and cabinet positions involve divesting assets, though potentially tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.

The fundamental issue is that cabinet heads and ambassadors are often "figureheads" who cannot effectively manage their departments because they cannot fire staff, leading to a lack of accountability within the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.

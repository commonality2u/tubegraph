The [[state_of_the_market_and_economic_outlook | economic outlook]] and [[recession_fears_and_economic_forecasts | recession predictions]] were discussed by Elon Musk, who shared his views on the current [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | economic situation]] and potential future trends.

## Predicting Recessions
Elon Musk noted that predicting economics is "always difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. However, he stated that he had previously predicted a recession might occur in approximately Spring 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, which he felt was "nailed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

## The Nature of Recessions
Musk argued that recessions are "not necessarily a bad thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. He explained that prolonged economic booms can lead to a "misallocation of capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>, where "any dumb thing gets money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>. This also results in a misallocation of "human capital," with people "doing things that are silly and not useful to their fellow human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.

He metaphorically referred to a recession as an "economic enema" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a> that "clears out the pipes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. During this process, "silly companies" go bankrupt, and those producing "useful products" become prosperous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

## Current Economic Status and Duration
Musk believes that "more likely than not it is a recession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a> and that this recession "will get worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. However, he added that "these things pass and then there will be boom times again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>. He estimated that the "tough going" for the economy might last "a year, maybe 12 to 18 months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>, which is typically the duration for a "correction to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

The interviewer agreed, stating that what started as a slowdown earlier in the year now "feels like we're in one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. He noted that "growth stock and software businesses" are "the canaries in the coal mine and there's a lot of a lot of dead canaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.

## Advice for Companies
Companies should ensure they have "some capital reserves to last through irrational times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>, as recessions can "flip like a light switch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. He cited PayPal's experience in March 2000, when money was "fire hosing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>, but by April 2000, the market was in "free fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>, and even good companies struggled to raise money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.

If a recession is indeed happening, companies should focus on their "cash flow" and aim to achieve "positive cash flow soon as you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

## Inflation and Government Spending
Regarding [[us_economic_situation_and_inflation | inflation]], Musk stated that the "obvious reason for inflation is that the government printed a zillion amount more money than it had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. He explained that if the government issues checks "far in excess of revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a> without an increase in goods and services output, inflation will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>. He cautioned that if deficits didn't matter, they could be made "a hundred times bigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>, but this would "basically turn the dollar into something that is worthless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>, citing Venezuela as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>.

He emphasized that the "true economy is the output of goods and services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>, and money is merely an "information system for labor allocation and for exchange of goods and services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.

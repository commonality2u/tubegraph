The Biden administration's 2025 budget includes proposals for significant increases to capital gains taxes and the implementation of a wealth tax on unrealized gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>.

## Key Proposals

The 2025 budget puts forth three proposals to increase capital gains rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:29">[01:27:29]</a>. If all three were to pass, the long-term capital gains tax could more than double to nearly 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>. This increase would primarily affect those making \$1 million or more annually, a group representing less than 1% of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>.

Currently, the highest long-term capital gains rate is 20%, or about 24% for individuals earning over \$200,000 per year due to an additional small tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>. These proposals, if enacted, would result in the highest capital gains rate in 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>.

Additionally, the budget proposes a 25% tax on unrealized capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. This would apply to the total income, including unrealized capital gains, for all taxpayers with a net worth exceeding \$100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>. This concept is similar to [[kamala_harriss_wealth_tax_proposal | Kamala Harris's wealth tax proposal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:02">[01:30:02]</a>.

## Economic Impact

Critics argue that these tax hikes would be "crushing" for innovation and investment in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:52">[01:28:52]</a>. The 25% unrealized gains tax is described as a "pure confiscation" where a founder or small business owner would have to sell a significant portion (e.g., 40%) of their company just to pay the tax, even before realizing any profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>. This could "destroy the startup ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>.

Concerns were raised that these measures would not balance the budget, pay down the national debt, or save Social Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:19">[01:33:19]</a>. Instead, they are seen as part of an "inevitable trend" of increasing federal revenue through taxation that will feel "deeply uncomfortable and inappropriate" and have "negative economic consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>.

A theory suggests that people who support such asset taxes view private assets of citizens as belonging to the government, essentially claiming "all it takes is all you got" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>. This perspective implies that private wealth, including homes and 401ks, could be seen as government assets to offset national liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:14">[01:35:14]</a>.

## Political Feasibility and Public Opinion

While these proposals may seem unlikely to pass, their inclusion in the budget raises concerns about their potential passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. The argument is that if Democrats achieve a "trifecta" (control of the presidency, Senate, and House) in the upcoming election, and without senators like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who opposed similar measures previously, such legislation could pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>.

A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of 4,900 registered voters in seven swing states indicated that 77% support an asset tax on ultra-high net worth individuals (over \$100 million) to keep Social Security solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>. This contrasts with only 25% support for raising the minimum age for Social Security from 67 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>.

However, it was noted that such poll questions can be "loaded" and framed to elicit specific answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:27">[01:32:27]</a>. The argument is that posing a complex tax against a popular program like Social Security will naturally skew results towards the tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:27">[01:32:27]</a>.

The discussion highlights the broader debate on [[us_fiscal_policy_and_debt_challenges | US fiscal policy and debt challenges]], [[economic_policy_and_managing_us_debt | economic policy and managing US debt]], and how to balance revenue generation with economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>. Some suggest that the alternative to increased taxes is to "cut spending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:25">[01:35:25]</a>. The political implications include a potential dilemma for high-earning voters, who might have to choose between financial liquidation under such tax policies or supporting a different political candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:42">[01:35:42]</a>.

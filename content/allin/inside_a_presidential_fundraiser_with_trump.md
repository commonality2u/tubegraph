An exclusive look inside a presidential fundraiser highlights the elaborate preparations, the contrasting public sentiment, and the engaging persona of former President [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Donald Trump]].

## Event Preparation and Atmosphere
Hosting a presidential fundraiser involves an extensive level of preparation, primarily managed by the Secret Service and the president's advance team. They meticulously work out every detail, including mapping out the host's house [00:19:18]. The police shut down surrounding streets, making it a very involved process [00:09:21].

### Public Reaction and Protests
Leading up to the event, San Francisco publications attempted to generate anti-Trump protests [00:10:08]. However, the actual turnout showed an overwhelming number of pro-[[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]] demonstrators, who waved flags and cheered his motorcade [00:10:20]. There was a noticeable "enthusiasm gap" with "almost no anti-[[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]] protesters" [00:10:17], while [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]] supporters exhibited significant enthusiasm [00:10:40]. This suggests that being "against [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]] for eight years" has been exhausting for some [00:10:50].

## Trump's Engagement and Persona
Attendees at the fundraiser were struck by [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]]'s engaging qualities:
*   **Charming and Connecting** [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]] is described as "extremely charming" and capable of connecting with people in about five seconds, finding interesting or funny things to say [00:11:42].
*   **Hilarious and Extemporaneous** He is considered "hilarious" and spoke extemporaneously for an hour, with every speech being different and no teleprompter used [00:11:51].
*   **Sharp and On the Ball** His awareness was noted when he recognized and engaged with the Winlos brothers in the audience for a "hilarious routine," despite never having met them before [00:13:13].
*   **Polite and Kind** One attendee expressed surprise at how "very polite" and "kind" [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]] was, disarming previous misjudgments [00:14:52].
*   **Incredible Energy Level** His day started at Mar-a-Lago at 3:30 AM Pacific Time, included a rally in Arizona, a four-hour event in San Francisco, and further events in LA the next day, all while maintaining "amazing" energy [00:13:33].

### Policy and Supporters
A notable observation was that many attendees and first-time donors did not identify as Republican and had previously voted or donated Democrat [00:11:00]. Their support stemmed from [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Trump]]'s policies on war, immigration, and crypto [00:11:15]. The campaign noted a higher number of first-time donors at this event than previously seen [00:11:23].

There's a strong sentiment that Democrats are not listening to people, leading to a potential loss in the election, with predictions of [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Biden]] being "demolished" [00:18:05]. The idea of a "hot swap" for the Democratic candidate is predicted due to [[US political dynamics and Trump administration | Biden]]'s perceived cognitive decline [00:19:49]. Some believe the 2024 election will ultimately be [[Trump and Kamala Harris 2024 presidential race dynamics | Trump versus Kamala Harris]] [00:20:06].

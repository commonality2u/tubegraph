## Global Trade Disruptions and Their Economic Impact

Recent events in the Red Sea have led to significant [[Impact of macroeconomic trends | global trade disruptions]], affecting shipping routes and raising concerns about potential [[impact_of_tariffs_on_the_global_economy | economic impacts]]. These attacks highlight the fragility of the [[Impact of Tariffs on Supply Chain | global supply chain]] and raise questions about the future of international commerce and geopolitics.

### Red Sea Attacks: A Maritime Chokepoint in Crisis

The Houthi movement has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea using drones and missiles [00:08:02]. These actions are claimed as revenge for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, with the Houthis stating they will cease attacks once food and medicine are allowed to freely enter Gaza [00:08:15]. Some analysts suggest these attacks are also a power play for increased legitimacy in the region [00:08:28].

International allies, including the UK, Canada, and France, are reportedly preparing to deploy naval vessels to the area to deter further strikes [00:38:33].

#### Impact on Shipping and Trade

The attacks have significantly interrupted one of the world's busiest trade routes [00:08:50]. All five of the world's largest shipping conglomerates have paused transfers through the Red Sea [00:08:54]. This forces ships to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope, adding thousands of extra miles to journeys from Asia to Europe [00:08:58].

According to Ryan Peterson, founder of Flexport:
*   Approximately 30% of all ocean container traffic, primarily from Asia to Europe, flows through the Suez Canal and Red Sea [00:11:03].
*   Rerouting around the southern tip of Africa adds an estimated 20% to 25% to the journey length, effectively cutting shipping capacity by 20% to 25% for containers on these routes [00:11:23].
*   The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a narrow chokepoint, sees about 12% of global oil and 8% of liquefied natural gas transit through it [00:11:39]. This area has historically been a critical maritime chokepoint for thousands of years [00:12:03].
*   The firing of missiles by Yemeni rebel forces spikes insurance costs and endangers crew lives, making it impossible for ships to operate without insurance [00:12:42].
*   While not as impactful as the COVID-19-era shipping disruptions (which saw a 20% capacity reduction combined with a 20% demand increase), freight prices for ocean freight from Asia to Europe have already seen a 3x increase compared to a month or two ago [00:13:11].

Peterson believes the Suez Canal is too valuable to civilization for this disruption to last for an extended period [00:13:49]. However, David Sacks notes that despite being called "rebels," the Houthi group, a Shia group in Yemen, controls most of Yemen [00:14:14]. They are aligned with Iran [00:14:33] and have stated their actions are in solidarity with Palestinians [00:14:44]. While they claim to only target ships transacting with Israel, many Western ships without such ties have been targeted [00:15:15].

The US has announced "Operation Prosperity Guardian" to restore trade flow in the Red Sea, which may involve military action against the Houthis [00:15:31]. However, the Houthis have survived nearly a decade of Western-sponsored attacks by Saudi Arabia [00:15:56], indicating that a quick resolution is not guaranteed [00:16:11]. An escalation of this conflict could expand the Middle East conflict beyond Gaza and directly involve the US [00:16:19].

#### Economic Repercussions

The continuing blockade of the Red Sea could have significant [[global_macroeconomic_trends_and_challenges | global economic implications]]:
*   **Inflation**: Retailers have experienced deflationary environments due to lower ocean freight prices [00:17:30]. A sustained increase in freight prices could lead to renewed inflation, particularly in Europe [00:17:38].
*   **Regional Disparity**: The impact on Europe is expected to be much greater than on the United States [00:18:13]. Rerouting around Africa adds an 8% increase in transit time for Asia-to-East Coast US routes, compared to a 20% increase for Europe [00:18:50]. The Panama Canal is also operating at two-thirds capacity due to drought, further complicating routes to the US East Coast [00:18:24].
*   **Geopolitical Pressure**: The disruption is not good for [[US  China relations and business impact | China]], which relies on quick shipments to Europe [00:19:06]. Saudi Arabia's largest port, Jeddah, is also impacted [00:19:23]. This could pressure Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, to align with international efforts to resolve the conflict due to their long-term economic development plans [00:20:56].
*   **Asymmetric Warfare**: The Houthi attacks highlight an asymmetric warfare problem: cheap drones or missiles costing thousands of dollars can effectively shut down tens of millions of dollars in commerce because insurance companies will not cover ships in dangerous zones [00:33:28]. This lack of risk tolerance in the global trading system means that even minor threats can cause the entire system to shut down [00:34:28].
*   **Emboldenment**: The success of these attacks could embolden other groups to undertake similar actions, leading to more widespread disruptions globally [00:34:52].

David Sacks stresses that the ongoing conflict in Gaza directly affects the Houthis' actions, as they will not stop until Israel's war in Gaza ceases [00:24:30]. The Israeli public largely supports continuing the war until Hamas is eliminated [00:29:08], making a quick ceasefire unlikely [00:29:55]. This creates a "Black Swan" potential for 2024, where the Israel-Hamas war could spiral into a larger regional conflict, potentially leading to an oil shock [00:25:24].

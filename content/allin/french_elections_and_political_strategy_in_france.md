Recent French elections saw a "surprise upset" to the right, which had been surging in the polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. This outcome led to street celebrations and some rioting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

## Election System and Strategic Maneuvers
France utilizes a two-round voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. If no candidate secures a majority in the first round, a second-round runoff occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. In the recent election, President Macron's party strategically worked with the far-left, resulting in approximately 200 candidates dropping out to consolidate votes for the far-left and block Marine Le Pen's party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. This district-by-district strategy aimed to frustrate the popular will for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Key Political Parties and Their Platforms

### National Rally (Marine Le Pen's Party)
In the first round of voting, Marine Le Pen's National Rally secured a strong plurality of the vote, winning almost every district in the country except Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. Their primary issue is "unlimited immigration" into France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. French citizens, described as nationalistic, oppose this immigration, believing it is detrimental to their culture, societal cohesiveness, and crime rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Despite receiving a higher vote share (37%) in the second round, they only won 142 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

### Macron's Party
Macron's party secured 22% of the vote and won 148 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

### New Popular Front (Far-Left Parties)
This coalition of far-left parties, led by radical socialist Jean-Luc Mélenchon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, won only 27% of the vote in the first round but ended up with the most seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. Mélenchon has expressed radical socialist views, including:
*   A 90% tax on income over €400,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.
*   A 14% mandatory wage increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   Reducing the retirement age from 64 to 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   Implementing price controls on food, electricity, gas, and petrol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
*   Returning to a restricted number of hours in the work week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.

Following the election, Mélenchon announced that his party would **not** cooperate with Macron's party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. This situation has led to a "logjam" in parliament, as no single faction holds a majority and they are unwilling to work together, effectively delaying reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.

## Broader Global Political Dynamics
The French election results are seen by some as part of a broader global shift and a battle between socialism and free market democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. This phenomenon is observed in other countries like India, Mexico, the UK, and the [[US elections and political dynamics | US]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. The argument is that globalization has led to massive economic progress, but at the cost of wealth accumulating with a small number of people, leaving a large majority feeling left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. The rise of socialist practices is viewed as a push to resolve perceived inequality and market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.

However, an alternative perspective suggests that the global shift is less about an embrace of socialism and more about widespread discontent with incumbent governments due to difficult periods of joblessness, inflation, and high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. This view posits that voters are simply tossing out current leadership for new figures, regardless of their left or right leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

### Immigration as a Driving Factor
A significant, often overlooked, aspect of the French political landscape is the issue of Muslim Islamic immigration and the lack of integration of this population into French society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This sentiment is common across Europe, where people are described as nationalistic and concerned about preserving their culture and nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. They view "unlimited immigration" as economically and socially detrimental, contributing to crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

### Parallels to [[Political dynamics in the US elections | US Political Dynamics]]
Similar to France, some argue that center-left political figures, like President Biden in the [[US elections and political dynamics | US]], prioritize enabling radical progressives over implementing sensible adjustments that would be more popular, such as stricter immigration policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. It is suggested that neither Macron nor Biden have addressed popular demand for reasonable borders and immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. The ongoing push for reform is seen as a popular craving to fix a system perceived as rigged and corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.

A new stock exchange, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), is emerging with backing from major financial players like BlackRock and Citadel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. This initiative aims to challenge the established duopoly of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

## Overview of the TXSE
The Texas Stock Exchange will be based in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a> and has already raised $120 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. Its core pitch is that the NYSE and NASDAQ have become overly expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a> and have increased compliance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. Notably, NASDAQ introduced a new board diversity target at the beginning of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>, which has been described as "DEI stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. In response, the TXSE positions itself as a "CEO-friendly" and "anti-woke exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

## Timelines and Support
The TXSE plans to file its SEC registration documents later this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>, begin facilitating trades next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>, and host its first new listing in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. The involvement of Citadel and BlackRock is significant, as they can bring substantial business to the new exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. This move aligns with a broader trend of companies relocating to Texas, such as [[tesla_corporate_headquarters_move_to_texas | Tesla]] moving its corporate headquarters from Palo Alto, California, to Texas in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.

## Rationale for a New Exchange
Proponents argue that more competition is needed to provide companies with better access to capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. The existing duopoly of NASDAQ and NYSE is criticized for a lack of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a> and for implementing "regressive" listing requirements, particularly concerning board composition that doesn't align with economic rationale or value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

> "I do think that it's hard right now for companies to get access to Capital. I think more diverse and more flexible ways where smart investors can allocate their money into the ideas that they want are better." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>

It's noted that NASDAQ and NYSE have imposed rules unrelated to securities laws, including those on board diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>, leading to quiet pushback from public company board members and CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

The cost of going public is another factor; a survey showed that listing on NASDAQ or NYSE costs about $7.4 million, compared to approximately $2 million for an over-the-counter bulletin board service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. This highlights the demand for a more competitive marketplace for exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

## Challenges and Precedents
While the emergence of a new challenger exchange is not unprecedented—with previous attempts like the Long-Term Stock Exchange failing to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>—the current effort is seen as positive for increasing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. The discussion of these market dynamics links to broader concerns about [[the_role_of_platforms_and_regulators_in_market_disruptions | the role of platforms and regulators in market disruptions]].

## Introduction

The discourse on media has increasingly focused on the perceived [[media_coverage_and_bias | bias]] and activist tendencies within traditional journalism, leading to challenges in public trust and the emergence of alternative forms of communication. This shift impacts how information is disseminated, consumed, and interpreted, affecting various aspects of society, from politics to social issues and technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Perceived Bias in Traditional Media

Many view established media outlets as biased, particularly against certain groups such as technology entrepreneurs and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This perception arises because these outlets are seen to exhibit a "class hatred" toward such figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Critics argue that journalists often interpret statements to fit a pre-existing narrative rather than presenting information neutrally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Specific examples of perceived bias include:
*   **Political Alignments** Certain media outlets are seen as aligned with particular political [[mainstream_media_and_its_influence_on_politics | biases]], for instance, preferring those who "genuflect" to their political views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. It is noted that media outlets often "all think the same way" with "very small differences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **"Hit Pieces"**: Subjects of news stories often feel they are not getting a "fair shake" and that articles about them are consistently "hit pieces" designed to criticize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Activism Journalism**: What some refer to as "advocacy" or "activism journalism" is seen as a form of [[partisan_media_practices_and_regulation | bias]] where journalists push a specific political agenda rather than objectively reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Challenges in Journalism Practices

The pursuit of "clicks" has reportedly influenced journalistic practices, sometimes at the expense of accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Lack of Scrutiny**: There's a concern about a "zero checks and balances" environment where factual errors go uncorrected by editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. An example cited is a journalist confusing percentage points with basis points in an article about the Federal Reserve and the debt ceiling, which was a "numerically illiterate" error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Gelman Amnesia Effect**: This effect describes how individuals recognize journalistic inaccuracies in areas they are experts in (e.g., understanding only 10-30% of a story's truth when it concerns their field), but assume full accuracy in areas they are not familiar with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This problem is exacerbated when mistakes are driven by a specific agenda, not just sloppiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Headline Manipulation**: Headlines are often designed for maximum clicks, sometimes using A/B testing with software to find the most engaging wording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. For example, a Slate article's headline about a podcast was changed from "cronies" to "Elon Musk's Inner Circle," reflecting an attempt to drive engagement or a "bash" agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Many people only read the headline and interpret that as the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Rise of Direct-to-Audience Communication

In response to perceived media [[media_coverage_and_bias | bias]], many public figures and organizations are opting to communicate directly with their audiences, bypassing traditional journalistic filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Desire for Unfiltered Information**: There's a growing audience demand for "direct and unfiltered Raw point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This allows individuals to present their side without media interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Podcasters like Draymond Green have successfully built large audiences by speaking directly, offering a powerful trend in modern [[the_state_of_independent_media_and_broadcasting | sports media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Impact on Trust**: The growing direct-to-audience trend contributes to the [[loss_of_trust_in_media_and_search_engine_bias | loss of trust in traditional media]], as the public questions the necessity of intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Impact of Media Bias on Societal Issues

[[role_of_media_and_public_discourse_in_shaping_society | Media portrayal]] significantly influences public understanding of complex [[social_issues_and_their_impact_on_society_including_trans_rights_and_media_portrayal_of_police | social issues]].
*   **San Francisco Homeless Crisis**: The way media frames issues like homelessness in San Francisco is debated. Critics argue that framing the problem simply as "homelessness" is insufficient; instead, it should be re-framed as "untreated persons" suffering from addiction and mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This shift in language would lead to a different policy prescription, focusing on treatment and mandates rather than solely on housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. The crisis is also attributed to the rise of "super drugs" like fentanyl, which has massively increased the problem in the last 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
    *   The closure of psychiatric hospitals, stemming from policies by figures like Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, is cited as a historical factor contributing to the mental health crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
    *   The complex situation of an art gallery owner hosing down a homeless person highlights the deep frustration of business owners facing daily struggles with public health crises, emphasizing how both parties are victims of systemic failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Small businesses, especially in cities like San Francisco, face immense challenges and high mortality rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Over-classification of Documents**: The recurring issue of classified documents being found in the possession of former presidents (Biden, Trump, Clinton) suggests an "over-classification problem" within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>. It's argued that much of what is classified is not truly sensitive and that this practice, a "logical response by the permanent government to the Freedom of Information Act," allows the government to avoid accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. The lack of automatic declassification further exacerbates this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

## [[Impact of corporate decisions on media narratives | The Future of Media and Information]]

Technological advancements, particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI), are poised to reshape the landscape of information and content creation.

### AI and Generative Media
*   **ChatGPT and AI Hype Cycle**: ChatGPT is seen as a "degenerate AI" and the "hottest thing in Silicon Valley," demonstrating incredible potential in text-based content creation and query answering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. While considered a new "VC hype cycle," its technological potential is deemed "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. However, it's questioned whether venture capitalists will significantly benefit, as the development seems to be dominated by large companies like Microsoft (investing heavily in OpenAI), Google (DeepMind), and Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **OpenAI's Evolution**: OpenAI, initially founded as a non-profit in 2015 with a goal to "advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate Financial return," has transitioned into a profit-seeking enterprise, raising concerns about its original mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
*   **Impact on Business Models**: AI systems are shifting from simple "information retrieval" to "synthesis of that data," which fundamentally changes existing business models reliant on historical data presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>. This transformation implies that "every business model can and and will need to be Rewritten that's dependent on the historical legacy of kind of information retrieval" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **Copyright and Fair Use**: The use of existing data by AI models raises complex legal questions around copyright and fair use. For instance, if ChatGPT uses Yelp's data to recommend restaurants, it could be seen as depriving Yelp of income, leading to potential lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. The need for an "ai.txt" standard, similar to "robots.txt," is proposed to allow content owners to control how their data is used by AI and seek compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. Discussions around Section 230, which grants platforms immunity from liability for user-generated content, could also impact how algorithms are viewed in terms of publishing responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineering**: The ability to effectively interact with AI systems by asking the "right questions" is emerging as a critical skill, termed "prompt engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This could make individuals who master it "10 or 20 times more valuable" and become the "proverbial 10x engineer" of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. This development could lead to a "conductor economy" where individuals leverage AI tools to achieve intentional outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.
*   **New Opportunities**: While some fear job displacement (Luddite argument), the development of AI tools is expected to create "new work" and "New Opportunities," leading humanity to "level up as a species" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. The shift from a manufacturing-heavy economy to a knowledge-based one, and now potentially to an AI-driven one, suggests a continuous evolution of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. AI could enable the creation of new forms of content, such as AI-generated novels, symphonies, screenplays, and even personalized video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.

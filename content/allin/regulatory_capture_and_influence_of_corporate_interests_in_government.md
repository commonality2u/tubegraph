From: [[allin]] <br/> 

Robert Kennedy Jr. attributes the issues with various government agencies to [[regulatory_capture_and_its_impact_on_industries | systemic corruption]] and agency capture, rather than a "Deep State" conspiracy involving a group of individuals in "black coats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. He describes the corruption as systemic, where agencies become "captive" to industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. According to Kennedy, the people who tend to rise to powerful positions within these agencies are often "in the tank with industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

## Intelligence Agencies and the Military-Industrial Complex

Kennedy argues that the function of intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, has "devolved" to serve the [[military_industrial_complex | military-industrial complex]] and military contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. Their role, he suggests, is to provide a "constant pipeline of new wars" to feed this complex and the growth of the surveillance state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.

He highlights historical examples:
*   CIA Director Allan Dulles, formerly of Svin Cromwell, reportedly orchestrated coups on behalf of former clients like Texaco and United Fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   Kennedy's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, realized during the Bay of Pigs invasion that he had been "lied to" by CIA heads and his Joint Chiefs, leading him to express a desire to "shatter" the CIA into a thousand pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
*   His father, Robert F. Kennedy, also suspected the CIA's involvement in his brother's assassination and considered how to reform the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. He proposed separating the Espionage (information gathering) and Plans (covert operations) divisions to ensure accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

The critique suggests that the CIA views conflicts like the Iraq War as a success if their mission (e.g., deposing Saddam Hussein) is accomplished, regardless of the broader consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>.

## Agriculture and Environmental Protection

Kennedy claims that other government agencies, such as the USDA and EPA, also exhibit significant [[regulatory_capture_and_its_impact_on_industries | regulatory capture]]:
*   The USDA is allegedly "run by Carill, Smithfield, Monsanto, Bo Pilgrim, John Tyson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.
*   The EPA's pesticide division head, Jess Rowan, was found to have secretly worked for Monsanto for a decade, directing them to "kill this study" or "kill that study" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
    *   A co-host, who was an executive at Monsanto for a few years, claims the relationship with the EPA and USDA was not "cozy" and felt like a "challenging frankly regulatory process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

## Pharmaceutical Industry and Media

Kennedy asserts that the pharmaceutical industry wields significant [[political_influence_on_corporate_structures_and_policies | political influence on corporate structures and policies]] and [[impact_of_corporate_decisions_on_media_narratives | corporate decisions on media narratives]].
*   He claims that mainstream media outlets, including Fox News, rely heavily on pharmaceutical advertisements for revenue, which can influence their content and lead to censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. Roger Ailes, founder of Fox News, allegedly told Kennedy that "70% of the revenues" for his prime-time network news came from pharmaceutical ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>.
*   A federal law prevents the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization for a vaccine if an existing drug is effective against the target disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. Kennedy suggests this motivated a suppression of early COVID-19 treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin to protect the "hundred billion dollar vaccine enterprise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   Vaccine manufacturers were granted full immunity from liability in 1986, which, according to Kennedy, led to a "gold rush" in vaccine development due to the lack of downstream liability, upstream safety testing, and marketing costs (as the government mandates their use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   He points out that direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising on TV is legal in only two nations globally: the United States and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>. This, he argues, contributes to Americans taking significantly more pharmaceutical drugs than Europeans, despite worse health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>.

## Economic Policies and Externalized Costs

Kennedy criticizes industries like nuclear power and coal for not being truly competitive in a free market because they "externalize their costs and internalize their profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>.
*   He argues that nuclear power plants cannot get insurance policies due to safety concerns and rely on the Price-Anderson Act to shift accident burdens onto the American public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. He also notes that nuclear plants require "massive public subsidies" and do not have an adequate long-term waste storage solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   Coal, despite its high environmental costs (e.g., poisoning streams, mercury pollution), is presented as a cheap energy source but would be economically unviable if it had to internalize these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.

Kennedy suggests that existing rules for the energy system were "written by the incumbents to reward the dirtiest filthiest most poisonous most toxic fuels from Hell rather than cheap clean green wholesome fuels from heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## Presidential Approach to Regulatory Capture

As president, Kennedy would aim to "unravel" the [[regulatory_capture_and_its_impact_on_industries | systemic corruption]] across government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This would involve reorganizing government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He believes his critique, which attributes national issues to a "ruling elite" managing the country for its own benefit and "screwing the middle class," could resonate with the electorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

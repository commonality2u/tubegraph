The [[future_of_ai_in_technology_and_society | future of AI]] and [[advancements_in_autonomous_robots | humanoid robots]] is envisioned as leading to immense prosperity and an age of abundance, potentially transforming the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## The Age of Abundance
The rate of improvement of [[openai_and_ai_advancements | AI]] is faster than any technology previously observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. This rapid advancement suggests a future of immense prosperity, where there would be no shortage of goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. With the advent of [[openai_and_ai_advancements | AI]] combined with [[advancements_in_autonomous_robots | robotics]], the cost of manufactured goods and provided services is expected to trend towards zero, allowing everyone to have what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

> "The cost of goods and services will trend to zero, like I'm not saying it'll be actually zero but it'll be everyone will be able to have anything they want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

Elon Musk estimates an 80% likelihood of this positive future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. However, a potential challenge lies in finding meaning in a world where [[openai_and_ai_advancements | AI]] can perform tasks better than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## Optimus: The Humanoid Robot
The development of general-purpose [[advancements_in_autonomous_robots | humanoid robots]] and [[advancements_in_autonomous_robots | autonomous vehicles]] is considered crucial for this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. Once these are achieved, there will be no actual limit to the size of the economy, as productivity per person, augmented by robots, can increase dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

The Optimus project aims to produce [[advancements_in_autonomous_robots | humanoid robots]] at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   **Cost**: In high volume, after several production versions and reaching a million-unit-plus per year level, the cost of labor and materials for Optimus is projected to be around $10,000 to $20,000, less than a small car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
*   **Development**: It typically takes three major iterations for a technology to become excellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. Optimus is currently in its first version, with the second version expected in volume by the end of next year, and a third major iteration potentially by late 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. Major iterations are less than two years apart, suggesting a timeline of approximately five to six years to reach million-unit-per-year production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.
*   **Capabilities**: Optimus is designed to be a general-purpose robot, learning from human anatomy for design improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. For example, the next-generation Optimus hand will have actuators in the forearm, similar to humans, operating fingers via cables, and will feature 22 degrees of freedom, enough to perform almost any human task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. These robots could perform tasks like walking dogs, mowing lawns, watching and teaching children, or even colonizing Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.
*   **Future Ratio**: It is predicted that the number of [[advancements_in_autonomous_robots | robots]] will vastly exceed the number of humans, with a ratio of at least 2:1 or 3:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Technological Advancements
Tesla's approach to [[openai_and_ai_advancements | AI]] development for self-driving cars involves specific hardware for handling large contexts like gigabytes of high-definition camera data over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Dojo**: This is Tesla's training computer designed for compressing gigantic contexts of video and image data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. Dojo 2 is expected to be comparable to powerful training systems like Nvidia's B200 type system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.
*   **Inference Chip**: Tesla has designed its own [[ai_as_a_computing_platform_and_its_potential_disruption | AI]] inference computer for its cars, which is considered superior to anything available from suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. This team has even reinvented network protocols, like a transport control layer over Ethernet, for optimized chip communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

The development of these [[advancements_in_autonomous_robots | robots]] and [[ai_as_a_computing_platform_and_its_potential_disruption | AI computing platforms]] also presents the opportunity for a future where people can feel inspired and look forward to advancements like being astronauts on Mars or even going beyond the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

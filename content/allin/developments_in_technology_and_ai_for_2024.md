Discussions around [[predictions_for_tech_advancements_in_2025 | technological advancements]] in 2024 highlighted significant shifts expected in the AI landscape, business models, and various industries.

## Business Winners in Technology

Predictions for the biggest business winners in 2024 included a focus on efficiency, cost reduction, and new AI-driven capabilities.

*   **Bootstrapped Startups** Chamath identified bootstrapped and profitable startups as major winners, anticipating that it will become significantly cheaper to copy existing businesses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This is due to models becoming "10 and 100 times better," the cost of compute becoming "10 and 100 times cheaper," and the cost of energy becoming "10 times cheaper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. He suggests that companies can now be created very cheaply to attack existing businesses that have high overheads in people and processes, which [[Impact of AI on different industries and technical fields | AI can replicate for free]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Anduril's Roadrunner Product** David Sachs predicted Anduril's Roadrunner product would be a significant business winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This drone interceptor is designed for ground-based air defense and offers a more sustainable solution than using expensive missiles against cheap drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. The Roadrunner system, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, is reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a> and can either intercept or return to base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
*   **Training Data Owners** Jason picked owners of training data, such as *The New York Times*, Reddit, X (Twitter), and YouTube, as major winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. He noted that language models are quickly reaching parity, making the real value lie in the training data itself, suggesting that open-source models may dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. He proposed a market-based solution where [[openai_and_ai_advancements | language models]] respect copyright owners and pay licensing fees for data usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

## Business Losers in Technology

Predictions for business losers in 2024 highlighted the disruptive power of AI and shifting market dynamics.

*   **Vertical SaaS Companies** Chamath believes vertical SaaS (Software as a Service) companies will face significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. The availability of tools for code generation, no-code development, and co-piloting will enable engineers to become "20, 50, 100x more productive" in building custom applications for their enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This allows companies to create homegrown solutions at a very low cost, disrupting the market for expensive vertical SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
*   **LLM Startups** Chamath also predicted that LLM (Large Language Model) startups would be among the worst performing assets, believing they are "massively overvalued" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. He argued that open source is making an "incredible run" at proprietary models, with too many players leading to parity and unsustainable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

## Most Contrarian Beliefs (Tech/AI Focused)

*   **Decline in OpenAI's Enterprise Value** Chamath's most contrarian belief for 2024 was that the enterprise value of [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] would decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. He attributed this not to [[openai_and_ai_advancements | OpenAI]] specifically, but to the broader [[ai_technology_and_market_trends | AI industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. Key reasons included:
    *   **Latency**: The current latency of [[ai_technology_and_market_trends | AI tools]] (30-50 seconds per request) makes building production-quality code impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>.
    *   **Cost**: The economic cost of a million tokens on current platforms is "untenable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.
    *   He believes that capitalism will arbitrage these issues, leading to new cloud services with millisecond latency and significantly lower token pricing (10-20 cents per million tokens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. This will cause open-source models to "proliferate" and put pressure on proprietary models, leading to a reallocation of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.
*   **Apple's Gains in Generative AI** Jason's contrarian belief was that Apple would make "huge gains" in generative AI or AI in general, perhaps by rebooting Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. He feels Apple will not remain on the sidelines in the AI race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.

## Most Anticipated Trends

*   **AI-Driven Discovery in BioPharma and Chemical Engineering** Friedberg expressed excitement for the advancements in "predictive models, [[ai_driven_discovery_in_biopharma_and_chemical_engineering | AI-driven discovery]] of novel molecules, materials, and methods of production" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>. This includes new drugs and materials emerging from software rather than traditional lab discovery, promising reduced costs and environmental footprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>.
*   **Exponential Pace of AI Advancement** Sachs anticipates that the "exponential pace of advancement in [[ai_advancements_and_the_impact_on_technology_and_society | AI]] will continue" in 2024, leading to innovations percolating down to mainstream consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.
*   **Efficiency via AI and Outsourcing** Jason's most anticipated trend was efficiency, driven by [[ai_advancements_and_the_impact_on_technology_and_society | AI advances]] and outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. He noted that high salaries and a desire for remote work among American workers are forcing companies to build AI and software to automate processes and outsource work globally at lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. This "work from home philosophy" makes hiring internationally as easy as hiring locally, but at a third of the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Most Anticipated Media (AI Focused)

*   **AI-Generated News and Personalized Newscasters** Friedberg is interested in [[future_of_ai_in_technology_and_society | AI-generated news]], where real-time generative video takes news feeds as input and presents them in a user-desired visual format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>. This could lead to a "personal newscaster" that allows users to interact, curate their news, and even filter for specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Chamath echoed this, mentioning AI models that produce "stunningly symmetrically beautiful people" who could deliver news, allowing users to interact with and tailor the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. He noted that such products are expected to emerge in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.

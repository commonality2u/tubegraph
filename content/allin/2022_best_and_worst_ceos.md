## Best CEO of 2022

### Predictions for 2022 (made in 2021)
In 2021, the hosts made the following predictions for the Best CEO of 2022:
*   **Jason** predicted Frank Slootman and [[Elon Musks companies and roles | Elon Musk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.
*   **Chamath** predicted Satya Nadella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.
*   **Sax** predicted Brian Armstrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.
*   **Friedberg** predicted Jack Dorsey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.

### Actual Best CEO Picks for 2022

*   **Sax: CEOs who got "leaner"**
    Sax chose a generic category, stating that "every founder took my advice to get leaner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:52">[01:42:52]</a>. He believes that every CEO who responded to the market's "regime change" by cutting costs, getting leaner, and extending runway deserves to be on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>. He noted that many are still resisting or taking medicine in "little drips and drives" instead of swallowing it whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>.

*   **Chamath: Vicki Hollab (Occidental Petroleum) & CEOs who "bit the bullet"**
    Chamath's numerical answer was Vicki Hollab, CEO of Occidental Petroleum, whose stock was up about 140% in 2022, making it the best-performing stock of the year for a $63 billion company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>. He also doubled down on Sax's answer, praising CEOs who "bit the bullet" to guide their portfolio companies to cash flow break-even or extend runway to Q1 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:21">[01:44:21]</a>. He specifically mentioned the CEO of Klarna for having the courage to make cuts before others and the CEO of Checkout.com for taking a huge write-down to ensure company survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>.

*   **Friedberg: Warren Buffett**
    Friedberg's choice was Warren Buffett, citing his consistent ability to remain steadfast regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:44">[01:45:44]</a>. Buffett "stays within his zone of competence," doesn't let macro factors drive him, and is an extraordinary capital allocator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. He is the largest shareholder of Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:43">[01:46:43]</a>.

*   **Jason: Brian Chesky (Airbnb) & Dara Khosrowshahi (Uber)**
    Jason chose CEOs of companies that transitioned from "money losers" to "free cash flow" generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.
    *   **Brian Chesky (Airbnb)**: His number one pick, as Airbnb became a "money printer" and is still growing quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:14">[01:47:14]</a>.
    *   **Dara Khosrowshahi (Uber)**: His second pick, noting that Uber needs to cut more expenses but is also hitting free cash flow and strong network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:27">[01:47:27]</a>.

## Worst CEO of 2022 (Implicitly)

While there wasn't a specific "Worst CEO" category with predictions, several discussions pointed to poor CEO performance:

*   **Bob Chapek (Disney)**
    Sax identified Bob Chapek, the former Disney CEO, as the "biggest business loser of 2022" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:01">[03:30:01]</a>. Chapek was Bob Iger's hand-picked successor but made key mistakes:
    *   Allowed himself to be "Mao Mao'd by woke employees" into picking a fight with DeSantis over the "Don't Say Gay Bill," leading to economic retaliation from the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:12">[03:30:12]</a>.
    *   Bob Iger undermined him behind the scenes, complaining that Chapek was not soliciting his advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
    *   Chapek centralized P&Ls, infuriating creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:02">[03:37:02]</a>.
    *   He went to war with Scarlett Johansson over a $10 million settlement, showing a lack of ability to handle talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:15">[03:37:15]</a>.
    *   These actions were described as "unforced error after unforced error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:26">[03:37:26]</a>. Chapek was eventually forced out and Iger returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

*   **Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX)**
    Sam Bankman-Fried (SPF), CEO of [[Elon Musk vs Sam Bankman Fried | FTX]], was unanimously named the "worst human being for 2022" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a> due to the "incredible revelation of the scale of the scam and the fraud and the craziness that went on" at [[Elon Musk vs Sam Bankman Fried | FTX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:50">[03:14:50]</a>. The failure of [[Elon Musk vs Sam Bankman Fried | FTX]] highlighted "systemic laziness and blind eye and systemic bias" by investors and journalists who should have done more due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:10">[03:22:10]</a>. His actions caused widespread financial losses and chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:20">[01:56:20]</a>.

*   **CEOs of "Big Tech"**
    Chamath argued that "Big Tech" as a class was the "biggest business loser of this year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>. He noted three reasons:
    *   It was a "crowded trade" that finally broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:45">[03:00:45]</a>.
    *   Regulators began aggressively targeting these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.
    *   The innovation cycle shifted, as companies realized they couldn't outspend competitors and their spending seemed "foolish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:20">[03:11:20]</a>.

## Best Turnaround of 2022

*   **Jason: Mark Zuckerberg (Meta)**
    Jason believes Meta, led by Mark Zuckerberg, had the "best turnaround" of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>. After losing money and refusing a "riff" (layoff), Zuckerberg finally made cuts (reportedly 10-15% based on performance), leading to a stock recovery from $85 to $110-$115 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:32">[01:52:32]</a>.

*   **Sax: San Francisco Political Leadership**
    Sax noted a "partial turnaround" in San Francisco's political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:27">[01:53:27]</a>. Key events included:
    *   The recall of three school board members, including Allison Collins, by a 70-30 margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>.
    *   The recall of progressive D.A. Chesa Boudin by a 60-40 margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:20">[01:54:20]</a>.
    *   The rejection of far-left supervisor Gordon Marr by his own community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:36">[01:54:36]</a>.
    *   The reelection of tough D.A. Brooke Jenkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:43">[01:54:43]</a>.
    These events suggest that the electorate is now seeking "Centrist Democrats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:59">[01:54:59]</a>.

## Rudy Giuliani Award for Self-Immolation (for CEOs/Leaders)

This award is given to individuals who "poured lighter fluid and gasoline over themselves and lit themselves on fire for no apparent reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>.

*   **Jason: Kevin O'Leary**
    Jason chose Kevin O'Leary, who received a $15 million bag from [[Elon Musk vs Sam Bankman Fried | FTX]] and then "decided to try to defend it 18 ways to Sunday," burning his reputation in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:36">[02:10:36]</a>.

*   **Friedberg: Elon Musk**
    Friedberg controversially nominated [[Elon Musks companies and roles | Elon Musk]], not due to bad intentions or idiocy, but because his principled role in buying and running Twitter has caused him "a lot of reputational damage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">[02:10:53]</a>. While many appreciate his efforts, it has hurt his standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:31">[02:11:31]</a>.

*   **Chamath: Herschel Walker**
    Chamath gave the award to Herschel Walker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:09">[02:12:09]</a>.

*   **Sax: John Fetterman**
    Sax humorously nominated John Fetterman, noting that while Republicans who self-immolate "get laughed out of town," Democrats "just get elected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:36">[02:13:36]</a>.

*   **Additional Nomination: The FBI**
    A final nomination was for the FBI for the "poorly handled" search and seizure at Mar-A-Lago, which looked "kind of like an idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:11">[02:13:11]</a>. This contributed to the "combination of revelations" about government collusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:27">[02:13:27]</a>.

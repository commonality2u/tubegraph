From: [[allin]] <br/> 

A noticeable "vibe shift" is occurring in the tech industry, characterized by CEOs adopting more candid and outspoken communication styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This shift suggests a departure from the more guarded public personas seen during the "Peak Zero" and [[cancel_culture | cancel culture]] era of 2019-2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Characteristics of the "Vibe Shift"

The new trend sees [[Tech transfer and commercialization dynamics | tech CEOs]] becoming "radically candid" and seemingly less concerned about public relations groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the earlier period when figures like Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai were notably more vigilant about their public statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Notable Examples of Candid CEOs

### Jensen Huang (Nvidia)
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered a memorable speech at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, asserting that his "great advantage is that I have very low expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. He emphasized that high expectations often lead to low resilience, and that suffering is crucial for building the character necessary for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Huang even uses the phrase "pain and suffering" with "great glee" within his company, viewing it as a way to refine character and achieve greatness, which he distinguishes from mere intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Alex Karp (Palantir)
Palantir CEO Alex Karp publicly declared his enjoyment of "burning the short sellers" and taking "lines of cocaine and away from these short sellers" on CNBC, expressing a desire to prevent them from "pulling down Great American companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Other Figures
*   **Elon Musk**: Continues to be consistently candid, notably at a New York Times conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Mark Zuckerberg**: Has also embraced this candidness, releasing a video directly comparing Apple Vision Pro with Meta Quest 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Analysis of the Vibe Shift

### Less Worry About Cancel Culture
The general sentiment suggests that many individuals are less concerned about [[cancel_culture | cancel culture]] compared to three years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This shift is perceived as a positive and refreshing development, allowing people to speak their minds more freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Skepticism on "True Risk-Taking"
Some argue that while the candidness is welcome, these CEOs aren't necessarily challenging "sacred cows" or taking significant "dangerous truths" or "real risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. For example, Alex Karp's remarks are seen as a "colorful joke" rather than a risky statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, and Jensen Huang's advice is a "good lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg's comparison of products is seen as merely speaking passionately about his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

The argument is made that [[contrarian_beliefs_about_tech_and_economic_developments | Elon Musk]] stands apart by taking "real risks" in tackling censorship and promoting free speech on X, facing government investigations and compensation package issues as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg's historical apology to Capitol Hill is cited as an example of a CEO not "punching back" against political pressure, contrasting with what would be considered "super based" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Exhaustion with "Word Scrambled Gymnastics"
Another perspective is that the "vibe shift" stems from widespread exhaustion with the "multiple layers of word scrambled gymnastics" that people previously felt compelled to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. As [[tech_transfer_and_commercialization_dynamics | tech companies]] and their CEOs find renewed success after a period of malaise, they acquire "political Capital" which they are now choosing to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This suggests that a new generation of winning companies may feature leaders who take a different, more direct path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## The Role of Suffering and Low Expectations

Jensen Huang's comments about the importance of suffering and low expectations for success resonated strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. It's noted that a few years prior, such comments might have been criticized for being "out of touch" or "triggering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, but now are widely retweeted as "100% awesome" and "finally candid advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

This perspective aligns with Elon Musk's "happiness formula": "happiness equals reality minus expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

From an entrepreneurial standpoint, the idea that suffering, persistence, grit, and perseverance are requisite traits for greatness is strongly supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Traditional paths of success (good schools, good grades) often do not prepare individuals for the unpredictable nature of entrepreneurship, where "if X, maybe Y, maybe Z, maybe a hundred other things" occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Entrepreneurs constantly face problems that even the smartest teams cannot solve, requiring relentless problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

### Entrepreneurship is Not for Everyone
It is argued that not everyone is psychologically equipped for entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. The first test of an entrepreneur is the ability to convince others to join a "crazy journey" without immediate financial incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Additionally, founders need marketable skills (developer, UX designer, salesperson) which can be learned through self-motivation via online courses, books, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. While "everybody's capable of being a founder," "very few can finish a company" due to the constant ups and downs and need for resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Experience with rejection and failure, such as from cold calling or playing poker, is highlighted as crucial for developing the necessary persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

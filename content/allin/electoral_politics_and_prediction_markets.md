Traditionally, understanding who is winning an election involved looking at [[Polls and prediction markets in elections | polls]], despite their imperfections, which sometimes included outdated methods like calling landlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Models like 538 also aggregate these poll results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. However, in the current election cycle, there's a strong focus on [[Polls and prediction markets in elections | prediction markets]], also known as betting markets, due to participants having "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The accuracy of these markets compared to traditional polls and aggregators is a key discussion point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Current Political Landscape and Predictions

Recent shifts in [[Polls and prediction markets in elections | prediction markets]] reflect significant changes in the [[US elections and political dynamics | political dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. For example, in a 24-hour period, VP Kamala Harris's chances of becoming the Democratic nominee increased from 18% to 50%, while President Biden's dropped from 66% to 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Other potential "moonshot" candidates like Michelle Obama and Gretchen Whitmer also saw their odds rise from low single digits to 1-2% after a recent debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

A key chart from Polymarket indicates that the chances of Biden dropping out reached 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Despite a White House spokesman denying a *New York Times* report that Biden was considering dropping out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, the political landscape is in a "feeding frenzy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Biden's Future and the Democratic Strategy

President Biden is scheduled for an interview with George Stephanopoulos, which is seen as a critical moment for his presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. If he appears "sharp and responsive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, it could quell speculation about his cognitive decline; otherwise, he might be "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

There are differing views on the Democratic Party's strategy:
*   One theory, dubbed "hot swap summer," suggests a scenario where Biden resigns, leading to a "Democratic primary speedrun" with multiple debates to quickly select a new nominee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This would allow the party to appear democratic and generate public interest, aiming to "demolish Trump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   A counter-argument is that running a debate would show the party as weak and diffuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   Prediction markets suggest that if Biden steps aside, Kamala Harris is the only feasible alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Sidestepping her would offend a major Democratic constituency and risk losing roughly a billion dollars in campaign contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   Another perspective suggests that the Democratic Party, being run by "political insiders" who dislike billionaires, would never hand over the party's reins to an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This means it's "Kamala or bust" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
*   The media has been accused of a "gigantic cover up" of Biden's cognitive decline, actively suppressing questions and labeling videos as "clean fakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. This lack of an "honest media" means there's no check and balance on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

Some argue for the Democratic Party to consider an "outsider" candidate like Jamie Dimon or Bob Iger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. These individuals could self-fund, bring credibility, business success, and executive authority, potentially winning votes away from Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. However, a past attempt by Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire, failed due to public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### Urgency and Consequences

The electoral system operates on a tight schedule, with decisions needing to be finalized by mid-August at the latest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. The ongoing "dribble" of information and controlled access to the President is not dispelling concerns about his capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. There's concern that if Biden is not fit to run, he might not be fit to serve out the rest of his term, potentially leading to his resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This would elevate Kamala Harris to President, imbuing her with "gravitas and credibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, despite previous concerns about her readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

The situation is deemed "precarious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, especially given the global context of the war in Ukraine, where American cluster bombs have been used against Russian civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The Democratic Party leadership's decision on how to proceed will be "very revealing" of their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. The donor class, which is reportedly "fleeing the ship," may also be pushing for a change in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

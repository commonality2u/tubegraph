Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, has expressed that as a computer scientist, he has "never seen anything as exciting as all of the [[AI advancements and the impact on technology and society | AI progress]] that's happened the last few years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Brin, who registered Google as a website on September 15, 1997, and founded Google with Larry Page in 1998, has recently returned to helping Google's efforts in [[OpenAI and AI advancements | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He currently dedicates almost every day to this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Historical Context of AI

During Brin's time in grad school in the 1990s, [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] was considered a "footnote" in the curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Approaches like neural networks were largely "discarded" in the 1960s and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. There was a prevalent belief that these methods "don't really work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Recent Breakthroughs and Evolution

A "miraculous" shift occurred when people working on neural networks started making progress with "a little bit more compute, a little more data, a few clever algorithms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This led to "amazing" advancements in the last decade, with "new amazing capability" appearing "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Impact Across Industries

[[Impact of AI on different industries and technical fields | AI]]'s influence extends far beyond traditional areas like search, touching "so many different elements of day-to-day life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. A notable example is its impact on programming, where writing code from scratch "feels really hard compared to just asking the AI to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Brin recounts an instance where he had an [[AI as a computing platform and its potential disruption | AI]] model generate code for Sudoku puzzles, and then feed them to the [[AI as a computing platform and its potential disruption | AI]] itself for scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Model Architectures and Trends

Historically, different [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] techniques were used for distinct problems, such as a chess-playing [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] being "very different than image generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Even recently, Google's graph neural network outperformed physics forecasting models, utilizing a "totally different Arch" and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

In a recent International Math Olympiad, Google's [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] achieved a silver medal by employing three distinct models: a formal theorem proving model, a geometry-specific [[AI technology and market trends | AI]], and a general-purpose language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Despite these specialized applications, Brin notes a clear trend towards a "more unified model," envisioning "shared architectures and and ultimately even shared models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Compute Demands and Algorithmic Improvements

The development of larger, unified [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] models requires substantial computing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. However, Brin suggests that "algorithmic improvements" in recent years might be "outpacing the increased compute" being invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Despite this, there is "huge amount of demand" for compute from cloud customers, to the extent that Google sometimes has to "turn down customers" due to lack of available compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in AI

Brin acknowledges the [[Challenges and opportunities in AI development and deployment | challenges]] in [[Future of AI in technology and society | AI development]], particularly the need for robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. He noted that earlier robotics ventures by Google were "a little too early" because they lacked the "modern [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] technology" like general language models with vision and multimodal capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

He emphasizes the iterative process of bringing [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] to market: from a "moment of wow" with a demo to the hard work of making it "90% of the time" correct, responsive, and available in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Google's Approach to Deployment

Historically, Google was "too timid" to deploy language models, despite having invented the Transformer paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This timidity stemmed from concerns about mistakes, embarrassing outputs, or "dumb" responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Brin advocates for a more aggressive approach, asserting that the "magical" capability of [[AI technology and market trends | AI]], such as helping kids program complicated things with complex APIs, necessitates a willingness to "have some embarrassments" and "take some risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. He believes that if [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] is "something magical we're giving the world," it should be released, even if it "periodically get[s] stuff really wrong," allowing people to "experiment and see what new ways they find to use it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. He concludes that this [[AI technology and market trends | technology]] should not be "kept close to the chest and hidden until it's like perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### Competition and Value Creation

While there is competition among [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] companies like [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]], Anthropic, and Mistral, Brin emphasizes that the "tremendous value to humanity" from [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] goes beyond a simple race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. He likens the impact of [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] to the internet's profound effect on information access and communication, stating that the "new [[AI technology and market trends | AI]] is another big capability" accessible to "pretty much everybody in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

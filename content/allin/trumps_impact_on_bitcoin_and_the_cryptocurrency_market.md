Since the [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump election victory]], Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have experienced a significant bull run, with various related companies seeing substantial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:02">[08:02:02]</a>.

## Market Performance Post-Election

Within ten days of the [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump election victory]], [[Bitcoins market trends and ETFs | Bitcoin]] peaked at $92,000, an all-time high, before settling around $89,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:41">[08:09:41]</a>. Since early August, companies like Robinhood, PayPal, and Coinbase have seen their stock prices rise by double-digits or even 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:28">[08:29:28]</a>. This market reaction is attributed to the outlook based on [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump's election]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:10">[10:49:10]</a>.

The market views some of [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump's policies]] as stimulatory, driven by anticipated lower tax rates and increased deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:09">[10:59:09]</a>. This deregulatory environment is expected to particularly benefit markets like crypto, finance, and fintech, enabling them to launch products and generate revenue more easily than under previous regulatory schemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:42">[11:10:42]</a>.

## Trump's Pro-Crypto Stance

During his campaign, [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump]] actively courted the [[US crypto regulations and industry impact | crypto industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:20">[08:22:20]</a>. Key promises included:

*   **Firing Gary Gensler**: At a [[Bitcoins market trends and ETFs | Bitcoin]] conference in July, [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump]] stated he would "fire Gary Gensler and appoint a new SEC chairman" on day one of his presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:20">[08:41:20]</a>. While a president cannot directly fire the SEC chair, they can appoint a new one when the term ends in 2026, or the incumbent may resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:10">[09:28:10]</a>. Speculation arose that Gensler might step down, given a press release where he stated it was "a great honor to serve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:10">[09:41:10]</a>.
*   **No Sale of Bitcoin Holdings**: [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump]] pledged that the federal government would "never, never ever sell its [[Bitcoins market trends and ETFs | Bitcoin]] holdings," which are acquired through criminal asset forfeitures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin and Crypto Presidential Advisory Council**: He proposed creating such a council, stating that "the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:53">[10:11:53]</a>.
*   **Minting Bitcoin in America**: [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump]] advocated for all future [[Bitcoins market trends and ETFs | Bitcoins]] to be minted in America, though the feasibility of this choice is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:25">[10:24:25]</a>.

## Regulatory Outlook

The House Republicans already passed a framework for [[US crypto regulations and industry impact | crypto regulation]] earlier in the year, known as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:44">[19:23:44]</a>. This bill would classify digital assets as commodities regulated by the CFTC if their underlying blockchain is "functional and decentralized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:05">[19:37:05]</a>. If a blockchain is functional but not decentralized, the assets would be considered securities under the SEC's purview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. The crypto industry desires a clear distinction between commodities and securities, preferring CFTC regulation for commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:33">[19:57:33]</a>.

With Republicans now controlling the Senate, the prospects for FIT21, or similar legislation, are greatly improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:25">[20:11:25]</a>. This, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the [[New SEC Chair and its impact on cryptocurrency regulations | SEC Chair's tenure]], suggests that the "days of Gensler terrorizing crypto companies by issuing Wells notices without clarifying what the rules are" may be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:04">[20:33:04]</a>. This expectation of clear rules is a key driver for the rallying [[US crypto regulations and industry impact | crypto markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:39">[20:58:39]</a>.

## Bitcoin as an Asset Class

Currently, [[Bitcoins market trends and ETFs | Bitcoin]] is largely viewed as a dollar-denominated asset and acts as a "very good gold proxy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:52">[15:58:52]</a>. Its price is "totally correlated" with other risk assets, meaning it tends to perform well when there's optimism about the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:15">[16:19:15]</a>. While some purists believe [[Bitcoins market trends and ETFs | Bitcoin]] will eventually become an independent, non-speculative store of value, that day is not yet here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

The broader market optimism, driven by the [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump Administration's]] projected policies, is leading to risk-seeking behavior and a "crushing" of risk spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. This positive sentiment, particularly concerning deregulation and potentially lower taxes, is expected to accelerate earnings for some businesses, leading investors to accept higher multiples today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

## Broader Economic Implications

The [[potential_trump_win_and_economic_consequences | Trump Administration]] is expected to end an era of "deceleration of regulatory capture and lawfare," benefiting equities previously restrained by such pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:20">[34:00:20]</a>. This is seen as a "disruptive force" aimed at testing federal agencies and bureaucratic systems, potentially making the government "stronger," "harder," and "more resilient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

The overall sentiment is that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal path, and shaking up the bureaucracy carries more upside than downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. The biggest risk is perceived as inertia, leading to potential bankruptcy rather than the disruption itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

### Poly Market FBI Raid

The FBI raid on Poly Market CEO Shane Copeland's home, eight days after the election, has been interpreted by Poly Market as "political retribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:16:00">[59:16:00]</a>. Poly Market was investigated for allegedly accepting trades from US-based users, despite having settled a case with the CFTC in 2022 and taking measures to block US traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:28:00">[58:28:00]</a>. The timing of the raid, *after* the election, suggests the FBI avoided acting beforehand to prevent accusations of political interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

The incident raises questions, with theories ranging from illegal domestic wagering (though a recent court ruling made it legal) to wash trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. A more controversial theory suggests a potential manipulation of prediction markets on behalf of the [[Kamala Harris campaign]] to feed a media narrative of a late surge for Harris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. However, there is no evidence to support this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

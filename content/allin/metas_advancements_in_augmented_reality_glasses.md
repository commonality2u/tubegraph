Meta has been making significant strides in [[AI advancements and the impact on technology and society | augmented reality]] (AR) glasses, positioning them as a key component of a new era of "ambient computing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. This represents a potential paradigm shift from traditional mobile handsets and browser interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>.

## Current State and Features
Meta's AR glasses are described as "chunky sunglasses," distinct from bulkier devices like Apple's Vision Pro "goggles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. A key feature demonstrated in prototypes is a wristband that tracks finger and wrist movements, allowing for interaction without needing to take out a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.

While not yet ready for prime time, Meta has produced around a thousand prototypes, loaning them to influencers for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. Initial feedback suggests these glasses appear "meaningfully better" than the Apple Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a> and allow users to look "semi-normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

## The Role of AI and Ambient Computing
The advancements in [[AI advancements and the impact on technology and society | AI]] are crucial to the potential success of Meta's AR glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. Meta had already made significant investments in this area before [[OpenAI and AI advancements | AI]] became prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

[[AI advancements and the impact on technology and society | AI]] enables several key functionalities for ambient computing:
*   **Voice and Audio Response** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>: The device can respond to natural language commands and speak to the user, similar to how [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]]'s voice control system facilitates dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
*   **Computer Vision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>: This allows the device to understand the surrounding world, functioning as a "true personal digital assistant in the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>.
*   **Control Systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>: Ambient computing relies on voice, gesture, and eye control, replacing traditional mice, keyboards, and touchscreens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. This liberates users from "hunting and pecking" and allows the computer to intuitively understand and execute tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

The vision for ambient computing suggests a future where information is accessed and tasks are completed seamlessly, without constant interaction with a phone screen, potentially improving social engagement in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite the progress, the ubiquity of glasses as the "perfect form factor" for a universally adopted device is still uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. The form factor is expected to shrink significantly from current prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

Meta is reported to be investing nearly $20 billion annually into its AR/VR division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. The company is seen as "executing extremely well," with advancements not only in AR but also in [[metas_open_source_ai_strategy | AI]] and recent cost-cutting measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. While there have been "false starts" in the history of computing devices, the current convergence of technological waves points towards a future where such ambient computing will be common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

### Political Predictions

*   **Sachs: Vladimir Putin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
    *   Putin stabilized Russia's economy in 2023 after Western sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> and gained the upper hand militarily in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   2024 is predicted to be a year of consolidating gains in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, exposing the "stalemate narrative" as a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   Putin's stance against the West has made him more influential in the Global South and BRICS countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, which oppose American dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
    *   Sachs clarified this is a prediction, not an endorsement, lamenting the war as a "gigantic mistake by the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> that put Putin in this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Friedberg & Chamath: Independent/Third Party in the US** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
    *   A poll showed over 60% interest in a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   The candidacy of RFK Jr., who recently joined the Utah ballot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, could lead to a meaningful, long-lasting change in American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   Many former Republicans and Democrats no longer identify with their parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Jason: Darkhorse Presidential Candidate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>

    *   Attention shifting to the Middle East, coupled with growing unpopularity of US funding for the Ukraine conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
    *   Ukraine's shot at NATO may fade, leaving the country behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
    *   Ukraine faces demographic decline and potential collapse, with lost soldiers and millions having fled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
    *   The "collective West" will be a big loser, as its "huge bet" in challenging Putin has "completely crapped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
    *   Israel's invasion of Gaza is not going well, creating a massive humanitarian crisis and international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
    *   Europe is facing recession due to losing cheap Russian gas, particularly Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

### Biggest Business Winners of 2024

*   **Friedberg: Commodities Businesses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>
    *   A "big commodities boom" is coming due to underinvestment relative to demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a> and a need to rebuild inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Cash is flowing back from treasuries as yields decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   **Chamath: Bootstrapped/Profitable Startups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>
    *   Underestimation of how cheap it will be to copy existing businesses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
    *   AI models will get 10-100x better, and compute/energy costs will get 10-100x cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
    *   Companies can be created very cheaply to attack existing businesses, as GPTs can replicate processes for "essentially free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Sachs: Anduril (Roadrunner Product)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>

    *   It addresses the asymmetric warfare problem where cheap drones are shot down by expensive missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. The Roadrunner system is reusable and autonomous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **Jason: Training Data Owners (NYT, Reddit, X, YouTube)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>
    *   Language models are quickly hitting parity, and the real value lies in the training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
    *   Proposing a market-based solution: users federate their subscriptions (e.g., NYT) with ChatGPT for enhanced tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Biggest Business Losers of 2024

*   **Chamath: Vertical SaaS Companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>
    *   These companies will be hit by cheap code-writing tools and co-pilots, enabling enterprises to build custom applications at low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
    *   Companies are already moving off vertical SaaS to homegrown solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Sachs: German Economy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>

*   **Chamath: Professional Sports Valuations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>
    *   Factors like the Liv Tour vs. PGA merger talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>, Saudi Arabia's investment in soccer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>, the explosion of NIL in NCAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>, and increased churn among streamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a> (the only ones who can afford high sports rights) point to a "Tipping Point" where acceleration of values slows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
*   **Jason: Smartphone Manufacturers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>
    *   Facing a major slowdown as consumers skip generations of phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
    *   Apple struggles to get people to upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

### Biggest Business Deals of 2024

*   **Sachs: FED's BTFP Replacement/Extension** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>
    *   The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), used to bail out regional banks, expires in March/April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
    *   Regional bank balance sheets are not healthy enough to survive without continued liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.
    *   The FED will need to replace or extend the program to keep banks liquid until the yield curve de-inverts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. This relates to [[market_trends_and_fed_policy | market trends and FED policy]].
*   **Jason: TikTok IPO/Spin-out** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>
    *   TikTok will face pressure from political factions to remove CCP influence from its board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.
*   **Friedberg: Generative AI Licensing Deals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>
    *   Expect "Blockbuster deals" where rights holders (e.g., Disney) license chunks of their library for generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a> to create on-demand video games, content, or merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

### Most Contrarian Beliefs of 2024

*   **Chamath: OpenAI Enterprise Value Goes Down** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>
    *   Based on high latency of AI tools making production-quality code impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>.
    *   The cost of a million tokens on platforms is "economically untenable" and "extremely expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
    *   Capitalism will drive arbitrage, leading to cheaper, faster cloud services (10-20 cents per million tokens) with proprietary hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. This will cause open-source models to proliferate, putting proprietary models under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.
    *   Existing economics will be reallocated, making it hard for current winners like NVIDIA and OpenAI to maintain high multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
*   **Friedberg: Increased Probability of Nuclear Weapon Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>
    *   This is conditioned on declining military supplies and appetite for traditional conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
    *   A tactical, low-yield nuclear weapon could be used if someone is "backed into a corner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
    *   He estimates a 1-2% chance, which is 10x higher than five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
    *   Also, a risk of Turkey being challenged to leave NATO due to siding with Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   **Sachs: Soft Landing Gets Very Bumpy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>
    *   Markets became "super optimistic" with pricing in big Fed rate cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>, leading to a strong stock market rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
    *   Despite not predicting a recession, Sachs believes there's "too much euphoria and overoptimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>, and 2024 will be bumpier politically and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. This relates to [[the_economic_outlook_and_recession_predictions | the economic outlook and recession predictions]].
*   **Jason: Apple Making Huge Gains in Generative AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>
    *   Prediction that Apple will become a significant player in AI by the end of 2024, possibly rebooting Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.

### Best Performing Asset of 2024

*   **Friedberg: Uranium ETF (URA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>
    *   Driven by inevitability, ESG demand, and conflict-driven demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
    *   China building 450 nuclear power stations, and global deregulatory efforts for nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Chamath: Public Tech Software Index (Long), Private Late-Stage Tech Software Companies (Short)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>
    *   Public market valuations are resetting, and growth rates aren't there for private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
    *   Private companies will experience dilution due to stock-based compensation, even if revenue doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Sachs: Energy Stocks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>
    *   Significant risk of escalating conflicts globally (Middle East, Ukraine, Venezuela/Guyana, Ethiopia/Egypt/Eritrea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.
    *   These conflicts could lead to a spike in oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This is part of [[global_macroeconomic_trends_and_challenges | global macroeconomic trends and challenges]].
*   **Jason: Consumer Comfort Services (DoorDash, Airbnb, Uber)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>
    *   Consumers are maxed out financially, leading to austerity measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>.
    *   People will opt for "small luxuries" and great experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

### Worst Performing Asset of 2024

*   **Sachs: The "Magnificent Seven" (Spread Trade: S&P 493 over Mag 7)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>
    *   What goes up must come down, and the hotter they are, the harder they fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.
    *   The S&P 493 are expected to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>. Huge gains by the Magnificent Seven were story-based (AI), but AI's role will extend beyond them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.
*   **Jason: LLM Startups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>
    *   Massively overvalued; open-source models are making an "incredible run" at them and hitting parity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.
    *   Too many players and too much parity makes prices "no sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.
    *   Valuations expected to fall by 50-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>.
*   **Friedberg: Vertical SaaS (Short), Cloud Providers with AI Tools (Long)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>
    *   Vertical software companies will be hurt by enterprises building custom applications cheaply using AI tools on cloud platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
    *   High-cost vertical SaaS (e.g., $5k/seat/year) will be replaced by homegrown solutions built at low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
    *   This is a "big macro trend" towards price compression and deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>, as the "SAS business model is really a temporary phenomenon" between the internet's ubiquity and AI's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.

### Most Anticipated Trends of 2024

    *   New drugs and materials are coming out of software, not brute-force wet lab discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
    *   These tools will introduce new products, reduce manufacturing costs, and lower environmental footprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Chamath: Bitcoin Mainstream Adoption** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>
    *   The most important year for Bitcoin due to imminent ETF approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
    *   This will enable mainstream adoption, making Bitcoin part of the traditional financial lexicon by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. This relates to [[investments_and_asset_performance_predictions_for_2024 | investments and asset performance predictions for 2024]].
*   **Sachs & Jason: Efficiency through AI Advances and Outsourcing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>
    *   The exponential pace of AI advancement will continue, leading to more mainstream consumer innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.
    *   High salaries and remote work preferences in the US are forcing companies to build robots, AI, and software for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
    *   Startups are increasingly outsourcing work to other geographies at a third of the price due to the work-from-home paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

## Overall Sentiment for 2024

*   **Sachs:** "Turbulent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>. He feels "level," but the world will be turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.
*   **Jason:** "Enthusiastic" and "Optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. He feels a lot of cleanup work from 2022-2023 is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a> and is excited to create new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.
*   **Chamath:** "Cautious" and "Pensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>. A lot is changing, and he worries decisions made now might need to be remade or unmade later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.
*   **Friedberg:** "Excited" personally about his new CEO role at Ohal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>. Globally, he is "a little cautious" and "nervous" about "tinder boxes" that could trigger other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>. He attributes this nervousness to unprecedented global debt, which can lead to societal fabric breakdown and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. This relates to [[state_of_the_market_and_economic_outlook | the state of the market and economic outlook]] and [[impact_of_macroeconomic_trends | the impact of macroeconomic trends]].

The hosts noted the political situation where Republicans might force temporary budget cuts, leading to a "1% cut across the board on discretionary spending" if a new budget is not agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.

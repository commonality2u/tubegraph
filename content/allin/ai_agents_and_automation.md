[[AI]] agents are emerging as a significant development in [[AI technology and market trends | artificial intelligence]], with 2025 anticipated to be a pivotal year for their widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. These agents, often described as advanced "cron jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>, are designed to operate autonomously in the background, performing tasks that typically require human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.

## Functionality and User Interface
Companies like [[OpenAI and AI advancements | OpenAI]] are reportedly planning to offer [[AI agents and automation | AI agent]] services, with potential costs ranging from $2,000 to $20,000 per month for various tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. Manis, a Chinese company, has showcased a compelling visualization of these agents, featuring a two-pane UI: a standard chatbot interface alongside a view displaying the agent's real-time actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. This agent can seamlessly toggle between applications like search, browser, code terminal, and document editor, creating to-do lists and marking tasks complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. The basic idea is that [[AI]] can effectively perform any action on a computer or [[software]] that a human can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

A new standard called MCP is rapidly gaining traction to facilitate the connection of [[AI agents and automation | agents]] with applications, enabling them to understand data and possible actions within various SaaS (Software as a Service) applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

## Impact on Business Models
The rise of [[AI agents and automation | AI agents]] is poised to fundamentally alter the [[Impact of AI on software and services | software business model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>. Traditionally, software is priced per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. However, [[AI agents and automation | AI agents]] allow software to directly pursue "labor spend" by delivering underlying workflows or outcomes to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. For example, if [[AI agents and automation | AI agents]] can perform work equivalent to paralegals, a software vendor could sell a multiple of the previous per-seat license, targeting the cost savings from human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

## Job Displacement vs. New Opportunities
There is a debate regarding whether [[AI agents and automation | AI agents]] will primarily replace existing jobs or create new opportunities. While some tasks will be automated, a significant portion of [[AI]] usage is expected to be for tasks that were previously unaffordable or never undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

*   **Logistics**: [[AI]] is used to make thousands of phone calls daily to truck drivers, identifying matches for loads and activating them on platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. This was previously too expensive to do with human [[call centers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Work**: The vast majority of [[AI]] use cases in large enterprises are for tasks like reviewing contracts, automating invoice processes, or creating marketing campaigns in multiple languages – work that was not previously feasible due to cost or complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. It's estimated that 90% of future [[AI]] usage will be in areas not currently performed by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.
*   **Legal**: [[AI]] is being used to review legal documents, identify changes, and compare versions, potentially reducing the need for attorneys in initial review stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Limitations
Despite the rapid progress, [[AI agents and automation | AI agents]] face significant challenges, especially in regulated industries where mistakes can lead to severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.

*   **Hallucinations and Accuracy**: Probabilistic [[software]] (like LLMs that can hallucinate) can produce errors, unlike deterministic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This makes quality assurance (QA) paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. For instance, in financial [[services]], an [[AI]] mistake could lead to fines for non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. The best models currently achieve around 90% accuracy in specific enterprise data tests, which is not sufficient for high-stakes applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.
*   **Trough of Disillusionment**: Many companies have invested heavily in [[AI]] products, but now face the "trough of disillusionment" as they encounter technical complexities and difficulties moving from experimentation to mainline production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Layering multiple [[AI]] models or running multiple passes to improve accuracy significantly increases "test time compute" costs, which can be astronomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.

## Exponential Progress
The [[AI as a computing platform and its potential disruption | impact of AI]] is not yet peaking, with exponential progress occurring along three key dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>:

1.  **Algorithms**: [[AI]] models are improving by three to four times annually, not just in speed but qualitatively, moving from simple chatbots to reasoning models that can break down complex questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.
2.  **Chips**: [[AI]] chips, such as Nvidia's H100 to GB200, are becoming three to four times better with each new generation, rolled out roughly annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.
3.  **Data Centers**: The deployment of GPUs in [[AI]] data centers is scaling rapidly, from hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of GPUs, requiring a shift from megawatt to gigawatt power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>.

This combined [[concerns about ais acceleration and potential risks | exponential progress]] (10x every two years) suggests a million-fold increase in [[AI]] compute availability over a presidential term, leading to massive impacts on the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.

## Specific Applications and Future Outlook
*   **Coding Assistance**: Progress in coding assistance is rapid because code compiles and can be objectively validated, allowing [[AI]] to learn and iterate effectively through reinforcement learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>.
*   **Math**: Similarly, math is another area where [[AI]] is improving rapidly due to the ability to validate proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:29">[01:27:29]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Compliance**: [[AI]] could classify products and determine duties owed, potentially becoming the "source of truth" if governments adopt these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>.

While [[AI]] may excel in areas with clear validation, its progress in less objective fields like legal work, where validation is harder, remains a key question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. The role of "improvement engineering"—a specialized skill focused on shrinking error rates to zero—will be crucial for building reliable [[software]] for enterprise production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:19">[01:32:19]</a>. This requires deep expertise in quality systems to ensure practical and trustworthy [[AI]] deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>.

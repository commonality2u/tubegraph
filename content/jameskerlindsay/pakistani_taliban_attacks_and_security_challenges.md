In recent months, the Pakistani Taliban, officially known as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), has carried out a series of high-profile attacks in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has led to concerns that the group is re-emerging as a significant challenge to the country's peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The situation has also prompted questions about the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Context

Pakistan, located in South Asia, is the 33rd largest member of the United Nations, covering approximately 880,000 square kilometres (340,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. To its northwest lies Afghanistan, the 40th largest UN member, at around 650,000 square kilometres (250,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While similar in size, their populations vary greatly: Afghanistan has about 40 million inhabitants, whereas Pakistan's population is estimated at 230 million, making it the fifth-largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Both countries are predominantly Sunni Muslim but are ethnically diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

A key ethnic group for understanding the region's dynamics are the Pashtuns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. They speak a language related to Iranian and are spread across Southern Afghanistan and Western and Northwestern Pakistan, numbering around 50 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Pashtuns constitute about half of Afghanistan's population and 15% of Pakistan's, where they are the second-largest group after the Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | Historical Context of Pakistan and Afghanistan Relations]]

The [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan]] began to take its modern form in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. After consolidating its position in the Indian subcontinent, including present-day Pakistan, Britain pushed north into Afghanistan, which was also a target for Russian imperial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Despite failing to conquer Afghanistan, Britain established friendly relations with the Emirates of Afghanistan in 1855 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. A second British invasion in 1878, though also beaten back, led to Afghanistan becoming a British protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. In 1893, the border was formally defined along the Durand Line, which significantly divided traditional Pashtun lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Afghanistan gained full independence as a Kingdom in the 1920s after the protectorate ended in 1919, and became a UN member in 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In 1947, British rule over India ended, leading to partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The Muslim-majority areas in the north formed the new Dominion of Pakistan, which later became the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

From the outset, relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan were strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Afghanistan challenged the borders of the new Pakistani state, arguing the Durand Line was never intended as an official boundary and calling for the Pashtun areas to be transferred to its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This led to significant tensions, with Afghanistan being the only country to vote against Pakistan's UN membership and supporting Pashtun separatist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Diplomatic relations were severed for several years in the early 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, and these issues persisted even after Afghanistan became a republic in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Soviet Invasion and the Rise of the Afghan Taliban

The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, following a Marxist coup, completely transformed the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. As a close Western ally, Pakistan became a crucial conduit for U.S. and international assistance to the mujahideen, who were fighting the Soviet occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This support continued even after the USSR withdrew in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan descended into civil war as mujahideen groups fought each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This provided an opportunity for a new group, the Taliban ("Students"), to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Drawing on ethnic Pashtuns educated in Pakistani religious schools, the Taliban soon gained the attention and support of Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Pakistan saw an opportunity to gain control over its "historically troublesome" northern neighbour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The Taliban rapidly grew in strength, emerging in 1994 and seizing the Afghan capital, Kabul, by September 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Once in power, the Taliban imposed an extreme form of Islamic rule, strictly applying Sharia law, curtailing human and women's rights, and destroying cultural heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Afghanistan also became a haven for Islamist militant groups hostile to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, notably Al-Qaeda, which attacked the United States on September 11, 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Weeks later, the U.S. and NATO partners invaded Afghanistan, forcing the Taliban from power by the end of 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. However, the group remained an active force, launching an armed insurgency against international forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Emergence of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP)

Pakistan was one of only three countries (alongside Saudi Arabia and the UAE) to recognize the Taliban regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. After 9/11, continued public support became impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. While Islamabad publicly disavowed the Taliban and joined the "War on Terror," it maintained close ties with its former allies, providing sanctuary for many of their leaders and fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Under increasing pressure to act against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, Pakistan launched a massive military operation in 2004 in the Pashtun-dominated border area with Afghanistan, then known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This incursion, involving 70,000 troops into an area long off-limits to the Pakistani government, led to widespread anger among local leaders and thousands of Pashtuns who had fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

In 2007, following a controversial military raid, Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]], emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Drawing on various militant groups, the TTP launched an uprising aiming to end Pakistan's efforts to control the Pashtun tribal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Relationship Between TTP and Afghan Taliban

From the start, the exact relationship between the TTP and the Afghan Taliban was complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. They shared close personal and ethnic ties, as well as a broad ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. TTP fighters also participated in attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. However, the two groups had distinct agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>:
*   The TTP aimed to oust Pakistan from the tribal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   The Afghan Taliban focused on expelling NATO from Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
The Afghan Taliban needed to maintain good relations with Pakistan and elements within its security services for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Escalation and Decline of TTP Threat (Pre-2021)

Despite these nuances, the conflict between Pakistan and the TTP escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. In 2014, following a major crackdown on the TTP, the group attacked an army-run school, killing over 130 children, an act that drew international revulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

In the aftermath, the TTP threat appeared to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Weakened by the Pakistan Army's operations, which forced it to relocate to Eastern Pakistan and Afghanistan, it also suffered defections to other Islamist insurgent groups, including the Afghan Taliban's rival, the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (IS-K) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

Meanwhile, as the U.S. began to draw down its presence in Afghanistan, the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban]] gained ground, often to the anger of Pakistan's Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. In January 2018, President Trump publicly accused Pakistan of deceit for sheltering terrorists, leading to the U.S. withholding at least $900 million in security assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Afghan Taliban's Return to Power and TTP Resurgence

Pakistan's gamble on the Afghan Taliban seemed to pay off in February 2020 when the Trump Administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The Taliban pledged that Afghanistan would not become a base for anti-Western armed groups in return for the withdrawal of U.S. troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Just over a year later, in August 2021, the remaining U.S. and NATO forces hastily retreated as the Taliban swept back into Kabul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

While the Taliban's return to power was met with global horror, Pakistan initially viewed it as a victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Although Pakistan joined the rest of the world in refusing to formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's government, its prime minister indicated the country's intent to be a link between the Taliban and the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

However, Pakistani hopes of becoming a new power broker were premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Taliban's victory in Afghanistan heralded a revival of the TTP, which intensified its attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Despite Islamabad's expectation that the Afghan Taliban would control the TTP, they showed little willingness to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Instead, Kabul organized talks between the two sides, leading to a ceasefire that eventually broke down in November 2022, sparking the latest wave of serious TTP attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## New Tensions and Border Issues

The border issue between Pakistan and Afghanistan is now re-emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This was highlighted in early 2022 by a dispute over a new fence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The Afghan information minister explicitly raised the unresolved status of the Durand Line and how it had divided the Pashtun nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Other significant shifts in the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | Pakistan-Taliban relationship]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>:
*   The Taliban regime in Kabul seems to have little desire or need for Pakistan's role as an intermediary on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   The Afghan Taliban appears to be actively pushing back against Islamabad, for example, by engaging with India, Pakistan's historical adversary, a relationship New Delhi seems open to developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

These developments suggest that having regained control in Afghanistan, the Taliban (or at least significant elements within it) are content to resist Pakistan's attempts to control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Their apparent refusal to crack down on the TTP, coupled with references to the contested border and a divided Pashtun nation, is a growing concern for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Pakistan, which once nurtured the Afghan Taliban for its own strategic ends, may now face a dramatic reversal of fortunes, with the Afghan Taliban potentially embracing its Pakistani offshoot and building relations with India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

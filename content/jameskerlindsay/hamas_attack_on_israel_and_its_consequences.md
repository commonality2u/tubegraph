On 7 October 2023, Hamas militants launched a massive attack against Israel from their stronghold in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This was the deadliest Palestinian assault on the country in 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Within hours, the Israeli government declared war on Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict

The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has a long, complex, and highly contested [[history_of_the_israelpalestinian_conflict | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The story for current purposes largely begins after the Second World War when the newly created United Nations voted to partition British-controlled Palestine into two states: one for the Jewish population and one for Arab Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This plan was immediately rejected by Palestinians and neighboring Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Hours after Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948, Arab states attacked the new country but were soon defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The defeat left Palestinians with only two areas: the West Bank, which came under Jordanian control, and Gaza, which fell under Egyptian military authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians became refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The refusal of Palestinians and Arab states to accept their loss led to a second war in 1967, where Israel again won decisively, capturing the West Bank and Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The international community, however, rejected these gains, with the UN Security Council calling for Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

In 1993, Israel and the PLO reached a breakthrough agreement, acknowledging Israel's existence in return for establishing a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza as a prelude to an independent Palestinian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. However, progress stalled, and a second Palestinian uprising erupted in the early 2000s as Israel expanded its hold over the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its forces and dismantled its settlements in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Rise of Hamas
With hopes for a final deal fading, the Palestinian community became increasingly fractured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, formed in Gaza in 1987 as an offshoot of the Islamic Brotherhood in Egypt and backed by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, rejected the peace process and called for Israel's destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Hamas began launching attacks on Israeli targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

In January 2006, Hamas won an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections in the West Bank and Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. After a national unity government broke down, Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Israel then secured its border and imposed a blockade on Gaza, heavily restricting access, while Egypt also enforced tight border controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Hamas, supported by Iran, continued frequent rocket attacks across the border, leading to fierce Israeli reprisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## The October 7th Attack

On 7 October 2023, Hamas fired a barrage of missiles into Israel, and several thousand militants broke through the fence surrounding Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. They launched indiscriminate attacks against military and civilian targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Over 1,300 people were killed, and almost 3,000 wounded, with reports of rape, torture, mutilation, and the murder of entire families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Additionally, up to 150 Israelis were taken hostage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This constituted the most significant one-day loss of life in Israel's history and the most severe attack on the country in over half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Israel's Response and Consequences

Facing accusations of an unprecedented intelligence failure, the Israeli government immediately declared war on Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Gaza has since been heavily bombed, resulting in over 1,000 Palestinians killed and an estimated 6,000 wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Gaza is now under "complete siege," with access to water, food, and electricity blocked, actions that some warn could constitute crimes under international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. With over 300,000 reservists called up and a national unity war government formed, a full-scale Israeli ground invasion seems imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### [[military_and_strategic_challenges_in_gaza | Military and strategic challenges in Gaza]]
While Israel's wish to retaliate is understandable, questions arise about the ultimate goals of this war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The air campaign alone cannot defeat Hamas, which has an underground network of tunnels, and disproportionately harms civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. A serious attempt to defeat Hamas will require a ground invasion, which carries significant costs and dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Urban warfare is challenging, and a continued presence on the ground would be needed to prevent Hamas from regrouping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict | Economic and political consequences of conflict]]
Israel faces the [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict | military, economic, political, and diplomatic costs]] of another prolonged occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Alternatively, maintaining a strict lockdown indefinitely would have horrific human consequences, leading to claims that Israel is attempting to force the population out or destroy it, potentially reigniting broader [[israels_defense_and_international_reactions | international opposition]] to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Risk of Escalation
There is a danger of further escalation beyond Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Tensions have heightened in the West Bank, with increased confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Fears also exist that the violence could spread to neighboring Lebanon, with concerns that Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed militant group, may launch an attack on Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Most seriously, there are concerns it could lead to a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, given Iran's financial and military support for Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Path Forward

Many believe that the only way for Israel to decisively win this war is to reach a final, comprehensive settlement with the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The conflict, after almost eight decades, must be resolved rather than merely managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

The UN highlighted the need to re-establish a "political horizon" for a settlement weeks before the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, negotiating under heightened tensions presents massive obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Creating a Palestinian state, while necessary, is not sufficient for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. A Palestinian state needs to be economically and politically viable, requiring territorial agreements, and enormous external aid and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Even if Israel and Palestine agree to coexist, groups like Hamas will remain as spoilers, requiring significant security support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Ultimately, resolving the conflict requires a monumental effort by the wider international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. The question remains whether the latest horrific events will galvanize the world to act, or if attention will wane, leaving the problem to fester until the next time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

For the past two years, international attention has been largely focused on the civil war in Ethiopia's northern province of Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, concurrently, another significant issue has been escalating: tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt over the completion of a massive dam on the Nile River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite repeated efforts to reach an agreement, the two nations remain at loggerheads, raising concerns about a potential [[resource_conflicts_over_water | resource conflict]] in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Natural resources, particularly fresh water, are increasingly seen as sources of tension and conflict in modern international relations, a trend exacerbated by climate change's impact on water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Nations Involved

The Arab Republic of Egypt and the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] are located in northeast Africa, separated by Sudan by less than a thousand kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Both countries are comparable in size and population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:
*   **Ethiopia**: Approximately 1.1 million square kilometers (26th largest UN member) and around 120 million inhabitants (second most populous country in Africa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Egypt**: Approximately 1 million square kilometers (29th largest UN member) and 110 million inhabitants (third most populous African state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Economically, however, they differ considerably. In 2021, Egypt's per capita GDP was around US$3700, compared to US$925 in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Historical Relationship

Egypt and Ethiopia are two of Africa's oldest countries, with links dating back to ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They were the first independent African countries to establish diplomatic relations in 1927 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, and in 1945, they became two of the four founding African members of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Despite this long history, their relationship has often been strained by issues such as Ethiopia's recognition of Israel in 1961 and their differing alignments during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, the most significant issue shaping their relationship has been the management of the Nile River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## The Nile River's Significance

The Nile River, at roughly 6,700 kilometers, is Africa's longest river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It consists of two main tributaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   **White Nile**: Originates in the Great Lakes region of central Africa (Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Blue Nile**: Originates in Ethiopia and joins the White Nile in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

For Egypt, the Nile is a critical natural resource, providing almost 98% of the country's drinking water and virtually all water needed for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Egypt is highly sensitive to anything that might disrupt the river's flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Ethiopia also views the Nile as an essential resource due to its significant agricultural water needs, as most of its population relies on farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Additionally, as one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, Ethiopia faces massive demand for energy, with nearly half its population lacking access to electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The Ethiopian government has long sought to harness the Blue Nile for hydroelectric power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)

Since the mid-1950s, Egypt has been increasingly concerned about Ethiopia's potential to build a dam on the Nile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Ethiopia had such plans but seemed to delay them due to fears of Egyptian reprisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In the 1970s, Egypt threatened war if the project proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Even in the new millennium, Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak reportedly suggested bombing any new dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

This situation changed in 2011 with the Arab Spring, which led to Mubarak's removal from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Seizing the opportunity, Ethiopia proceeded with constructing the [[grand_ethiopian_renaissance_dam | Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] (GERD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Dam Details

The GERD project is a massive undertaking, located less than 30 kilometers from the border with Sudan and estimated to cost over $4.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Height**: Almost 150 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Reservoir**: When fully filled (expected after 2024), it will contain 74 billion cubic meters of water and cover 1900 square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Capacity**: It will become the largest hydropower project in Africa and one of the largest worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The dam has become a symbol of Ethiopia's growing ambitions and a means to lift millions of its citizens out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Escalating Tensions and Failed Negotiations

The commencement of the GERD project led to severe tensions between Ethiopia and its neighbors, Sudan and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While Sudan initially opposed the project, it later shifted its position, seeing the potential for extra electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Egypt, however, took a much stronger stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Cairo insisted it did not object to Ethiopia's development goals but argued that the project must consider the legitimate interests of all affected countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Attempts at Agreement

*   **2015 Declaration of Principles**: An agreement initially seemed possible, with the signing of a declaration of principles in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, this did not lead to a comprehensive settlement, and tensions grew behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Accusations**: In 2016, Ethiopia openly accused Egypt of supporting separatist groups, including the Oromo Liberation Front, a claim vehemently denied by Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Brief Rapprochement (2018)**: In June 2018, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali held an amicable meeting with Egyptian leader Abdul Fatah El Sisi in Cairo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. They emphasized the ancient links between the two countries, created by the Nile, and expressed willingness to agree on the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Abiy Ahmed stated that Ethiopia would never harm the people of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Breakdown (2019)**: Hopes for a breakthrough were short-lived, and tensions escalated again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. By late 2019, the relationship completely broke down, with Abiy Ahmed threatening war if Egypt acted against the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **African Union Mediation (2020)**: In July 2020, mediation by the African Union led to a "common understanding" that could pave the way for an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, key elements remained unresolved, such as water release details during severe drought and dispute resolution mechanisms, with Ethiopia reportedly rejecting binding arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Current Standoff

Since 2020, there has been little progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Sudan has renewed its concerns, and Egypt has adopted a tougher line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. In 2021, Egypt's foreign minister stated that "more than a hundred million Egyptians face an existential threat" from the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

International concern has also grown, with the UN Security Council discussing the matter in 2020 and 2021, issuing a presidential statement calling for resumed negotiations under African Union auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Despite calls for diplomacy, tensions continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Ethiopia has begun filling the dam, a move Egypt condemned in a letter to the Security Council in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. More recently, Egypt has accused Ethiopia of obstructing talks and has sought to raise attention at international forums, including the African Union Summit in February 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Egypt repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot tolerate such a challenge to its interests, arguing that without an agreement, the project threatens international peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The GERD remains widely viewed as one of Africa's most serious potential flash points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. While a full-scale war seems unlikely, the issue could still spark conflict between two of Africa's largest, oldest, and most influential countries as the dam nears full operational capacity in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Despite studies showing an optimal outcome that could satisfy all three countries involved (Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan), there is little indication that they are willing to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

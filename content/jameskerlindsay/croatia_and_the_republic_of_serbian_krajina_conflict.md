In August 1995, Croatia launched a significant military offensive, known as Operation Storm, to regain control of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This area had unilaterally declared independence four years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Within three days, the territory was back under Croatian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

A quarter of a century later, the events remain controversial, and annual celebrations in Croatia marking the operation cause [[impact_of_operation_storm_on_croatian_and_serbian_relations | friction between Croatia and neighbouring Serbia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While Croatia celebrates Operation Storm as 'Victory Day' and the conclusion of its "homeland war" for national independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, Serbia views it as a moment of national mourning due to the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs from their ancestral lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Historical Context

### Croatia within Yugoslavia
Croatia, located in Southeast Europe, covers 56,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 4.1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. According to the 2011 census, ethnic Croats constitute about 90 percent of the population, with ethnic Serbs being the largest minority at 4.5 percent, and Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) at just under one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the territory of Croatia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Following World War II, Croatia became one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, alongside Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Road to Conflict
By the late 1980s, the Yugoslav federation faced increasing strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. As Croatia pursued a looser relationship within Yugoslavia, and even independence, the ethnic Serb minority in Croatia, comprising about 12 percent of the population, began to consider their own position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. These Serbs were primarily located in three areas: Slavonia (along the border with Serbia), Western Slavonia (further inland), and Krajina (adjacent to Bosnia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

In July 1990, Croatia adopted a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Believing this downgraded their status, Croatian Serbs began to establish self-administered areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The "Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina" was established in December 1990, followed by autonomous regions in Slavonia and Western Slavonia the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Fighting erupted as Croatian forces attempted to reassert control, marking the beginning of the Yugoslav wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

On June 25, 1991, Croatia declared independence alongside Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The federal armed forces, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), tried to suppress the secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Despite a ceasefire and negotiations, Croatian Serb forces, aided by the now Serbian-controlled JNA, gained control of approximately one-third of Croatia's territory, including the 87-day siege of Vukovar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Over 200,000 Croats and non-Serbs were forcibly expelled from these captured areas, a policy later termed [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

In October 1991, Croatia formally broke away from Yugoslavia and launched a counter-offensive, retaking large areas of Western Slavonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In response, Croatian Serbs unilaterally declared independence on December 19, 1991, establishing the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), which unified all Serb-controlled areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## International Involvement and Renewed Conflict

Growing international pressure led to a ceasefire in early 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A United Nations peacekeeping mission, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), was established around the Serb-controlled zones, which became UN protected areas, in return for the JNA's withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Attention then shifted to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had also descended into conflict, with Bosnian Serbs forming their own republic and Bosnian Croats attempting to secede, supported by Croatia, establishing the Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Despite this, fighting continued in Croatia, with several major Croat offensives in 1993 to retake Serb-held territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. One of these offensives was marked by extreme brutality, leading to war crimes charges against several Croat commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. A turning point came in March 1994, when the United States brokered a peace agreement between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims, allowing Croatia to focus more fully on the Serbian secession on its own soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

In early 1995, Croatia announced it would no longer allow UNPROFOR to operate on its territory, making clear its intention to retake the territory by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Operation Flash
The first step was "Operation Flash" in May 1995, where 7,500 Croatian troops attacked Western Slavonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Croatia retook the territory within days, forcing most of the 14,000 Serbian inhabitants to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. While this led to Serb forces shelling the Croatian capital, Zagreb, in retaliation, the Croatian government began preparing for the next phase: an attack on Krajina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Operation Storm
On July 31, President Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian leadership finalized plans to retake Krajina and force out the Serbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. On August 4, Operation Storm began with a massive artillery bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Serbian resistance quickly crumbled, and between 200,000 and 250,000 people, the vast majority of the territory's inhabitants, fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Within 72 hours, Operation Storm concluded, and Krajina was under Croatian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

The war officially ended on November 12, 1995, with an agreement to reintegrate Slavonia, the last part of the defunct RSK, into Croatia, a process completed by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legal Proceedings

Following the conflict, there was pressure to prosecute those responsible for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The ICTY was established by the UN Security Council to prosecute war crimes and human rights abuses during the Yugoslav conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. RSK leaders and key Serbian figures, including Slobodan Milosevic, were tried for crimes against humanity in Croatia, including murder, torture, forcible transportation, deportations, plunder, and destruction of property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

However, prosecuting Croatians for actions during Operation Storm proved more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. A 1996 Human Rights Watch report cataloged atrocities during and after the operation, including attacks on fleeing civilians and the torture and murder of Serbs who remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. ICTY indictments accused Croatia's leadership of a "joint criminal enterprise" to permanently remove the Serbian population from the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Croatia firmly rejected these claims, arguing the operation was justified and that prosecuting leaders was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

General Ante Gotovina, a key Croatian commander in Operation Storm, was arrested in 2005 and transferred to the ICTY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. In 2011, he was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 24 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. However, he and another general were controversially acquitted on appeal in 2012, based on technical discussions about artillery fire, and he returned to Croatia as a hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

In 1999, Croatia launched a case against Serbia at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Serbia filed a counter-claim, accusing Croatia of genocide during Operation Storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. In judgments delivered in 2008 and 2015, the ICJ ruled that while both sides committed acts that could constitute genocide, there was no definitive proof of intent to destroy populations (rather than simply force them out), meaning neither contravened the genocide convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Legacy

Operation Storm is considered one of the most important examples of a state using armed force to suppress a breakaway territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The legacy of Operation Storm continues to loom large in the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

*   Serbia views Victory Day as a provocative celebration of what is now widely accepted as an act of [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]], yet often fails to acknowledge the [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] that occurred earlier in Serb-held areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   Croatia views Operation Storm as a legitimate military action to retake secessionist territory, but often overlooks the significant humanitarian costs of an offensive that resulted in two-thirds of the country's ethnic Serbs being forced from lands their families had occupied for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Rather than being an annual source of tension, the events surrounding Operation Storm could become a source of reconciliation if both Serbia and Croatia were to reflect on the heavy cost of the entire conflict, not only on their own people but on hundreds of thousands of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

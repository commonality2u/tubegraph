In November 2023, the Armenian prime minister's decision to skip the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) summit, a Russian-led alliance, was widely perceived as a direct snub to Russian President Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This act highlighted growing tensions between Yerevan and Moscow, fueling speculation about a potential final break as Armenia strengthens its relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | war in Ukraine]] has prompted many European countries to re-evaluate their foreign policy orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. For some, like Sweden and Finland, this led to abandoning neutrality for NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Others, including Ukraine, [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_moldovas_strategy | Moldova]], and Georgia, have focused on accelerated European Union integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Armenia, located on the periphery of Europe, has also experienced a geopolitical shift, though it has been more muted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Historical Ties and Shifting Alignments

Since the end of the Cold War, Armenia has maintained close ties to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. These links, however, have recently come under significant strain, leading Armenia to reconsider its strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

After becoming an independent sovereign state in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia joined the Commonwealth of Independent States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Its relationship with Moscow was reinforced by close economic ties and the presence of a Russian military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Crucially, the [[2020_armenia_azerbaijan_war_impact | war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh]] further shaped this relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. While Russia officially remained neutral in this conflict, it was often perceived as favoring Armenia, partly by providing arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Tensions with NATO-member Turkey and Azerbaijan, which imposed an embargo, further underscored Armenia's reliance on Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. In 2002, Armenia became a part of the CSTO, a military alliance of six former Soviet states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Early Signs of Reconsideration

By the early 2000s, with Russia's ties to the West deteriorating, Armenia began signaling a desire for closer ties with the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. It joined the EU's Eastern Partnership in May 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. However, this pursuit abruptly ended in 2013 when Armenia unexpectedly decided to join the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead, despite nearing completion of a free trade agreement with the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Although Armenia later signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU in 2017, its commitment to Russia appeared firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

The dynamic shifted significantly in 2018 with the ousting of the long-standing government and the rise of reformist Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. While Pashinyan initially sought to maintain close ties with Russia, mistrust grew on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Moscow mistrusted the new democratic government, while Armenia grew concerned about improving relations between Russia and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

## Deterioration of Relations

The [[2020_armenia_azerbaijan_war_impact | 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War]] marked a critical turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Azerbaijan launched a military campaign to retake the region, and despite Russia brokering a last-moment ceasefire that included a Russian peacekeeping force, Azerbaijan largely achieved its objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This outcome was a massive blow for Armenia and led to widespread resentment against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. Many Armenians blamed Moscow for not preventing the war or intervening earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

Consequently, relations between Yerevan and Moscow steadily deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Russian officials openly criticized Pashinyan, straining diplomatic ties, while Moscow forged closer connections with Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. In response, Armenia began engaging more openly with U.S. and European leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Much to Moscow's displeasure, Armenia also began providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

The collapse of relations was further evident in September 2023 when Azerbaijan launched a fresh attack on Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. This time, Russia made no effort to stop the conflict, leading to Azerbaijan taking complete control of the region and approximately 100,000 inhabitants fleeing to Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

Since then, Armenia's foreign policy shifts include:
*   **Ratification of the International Criminal Court**: Armenia ratified its participation, a move condemned by Moscow given ongoing investigations into alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   **Boycott of CSTO Summit**: Pashinyan's boycott of the latest CSTO summit was called an "anti-Russian move orchestrated by the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. This snub was particularly impactful as it followed a high-profile trip by Pashinyan to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

## Challenges to a Full Western Pivot

Despite these apparent shifts, a complete break from Russia and alignment with the West is not straightforward for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

### NATO Membership
Switching allegiance to NATO would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. While many NATO members would welcome Armenia, deep-rooted tensions between Armenia and Turkey (a NATO member) mean Ankara, and potentially Hungary, would likely block any application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. Even if Turkey did not veto, it might demand unacceptable concessions, such as Armenia dropping genocide accusations related to the 1915 events or granting Azerbaijan a land corridor to Nakhichevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

### European Union Membership
EU membership appears to be a more logical and feasible option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>, especially with neighboring Georgia recently recommended for candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. However, EU membership does not seem to be high on Armenia's agenda, for two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>:
1.  **Perception of EU interest**: Most Armenians do not see EU membership as a realistic aspiration, despite a pro-Armenian lobby in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
2.  **Societal implications**: Armenia remains a largely conservative country, and concerns exist about the liberalization requirements of EU membership, such as greater LGBT rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. These attitudes about EU membership are reportedly encouraged by Russian disinformation campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. Public opinion polls reflect this reticence, with only about half the population favoring EU membership, significantly lower than other potential members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

### Security Concerns
Armenians also believe the West cannot provide the security they need, as the primary threats remain Turkey and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. There are fears that Azerbaijan may attempt to seize southern Armenia to create a land bridge to Nakhichevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Many Armenians feel the West would be unable or unwilling to prevent such an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Despite Russia's recent failures to protect Nagorno-Karabakh, some Armenians still believe Russia is the only actor capable of preventing further territorial division, particularly as any move to divide Armenia would sever an essential link to Russia's key ally, Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Armenians find themselves in a complex geopolitical position. While they no longer trust Russia, they feel that completely abandoning it for closer Western ties is not a viable option, at least for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.

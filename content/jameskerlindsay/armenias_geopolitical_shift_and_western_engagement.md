Armenia has been re-evaluating its long-standing foreign policy orientation, which has historically been closely tied to Russia. Recent events suggest a potential, albeit complex, shift towards Western engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Deteriorating Ties with Russia
In November 2023, the Armenian prime minister notably skipped the latest summit meeting of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a move widely seen as a direct snub to Russian President Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This decision publicly highlighted the [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | growing tensions between Yerevan and Moscow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Since the end of the Cold War, Armenia had maintained [[armenias_historical_ties_with_russia_and_the_west | close ties to Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>, including economic relations and hosting a Russian military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. These ties were further solidified by the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, as Russia was perceived to favor Armenia by providing arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Armenia joined the CSTO in 2002, a military alliance of six former Soviet states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

However, this relationship began to change in 2018 with the rise of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, despite his initial reassurances to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Suspicions grew on both sides, with Moscow mistrusting Yerevan's democratic government and Armenia becoming concerned about thawing relations between Russia and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The **Nagorno-Karabakh conflict** played a critical role in the [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | deterioration of relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>:
*   In 2020, Azerbaijan launched a military campaign to retake Nagorno-Karabakh, prompting Russia to broker a ceasefire and deploy a peacekeeping force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   This Azerbaijani victory was a massive blow to Armenia, leading to widespread resentment against Russia for failing to prevent or stop the war earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_peace_agreement_on_armenia_and_azerbaijan | peace agreement left Nagorno-Karabakh under effective Azerbaijani control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   The [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | frostiness between Pashinyan and Putin grew]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, with Russia openly criticizing the Armenian prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a fresh attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia made no effort to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Azerbaijani forces took complete control, leading to the exodus of over 100,000 ethnic Armenians to Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This event has significant [[future_implications_for_armenians_in_azerbaijan | implications for Armenians in Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   Further highlighting the collapse of relations, Armenia ratified its participation in the International Criminal Court, a move condemned by Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Growing Engagement with the West
Concurrently with the [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | decline in relations with Moscow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, Armenia has increasingly engaged with U.S. and European leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   Armenia began signaling a desire for closer ties to the European Union in 2009, joining the EU's Eastern Partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Although it briefly diverted to join the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union in 2013, it later signed a new Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   Much to Russia's anger, Armenia also started providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, reflecting the [[impact_of_ukraine_war_on_armenian_foreign_policy | impact of the Ukraine War on Armenian foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   The Armenian Prime Minister's boycott of the CSTO summit came after a high-profile trip to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, symbolizing a clear leaning towards the West.

## Challenges to Western Alignment
Despite the evident shift, a fundamental strategic and geopolitical break with Russia and full alignment with the West present significant [[challenges_in_armenias_potential_nato_or_eu_membership | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:

### NATO Membership
Switching allegiance to NATO would be extremely difficult, if not impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Deep-rooted tensions between Armenia and Turkey mean that Ankara, and possibly Hungary, would almost certainly block any application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   Even if membership were considered, Turkey might demand an unacceptably high price, such as Armenia dropping genocide accusations related to the 1915 events or granting Azerbaijan a land corridor to Nakhichevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### EU Membership
While a more logical and feasible option than NATO, EU membership doesn't appear to be high on Armenia's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   Many Armenians genuinely do not see EU accession as a realistic aspiration, shaped by a sense that the EU wouldn't want Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   There are concerns about the societal implications of joining the EU, as Armenia remains a largely conservative country, and membership would require liberalization, such as greater LGBT rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   These attitudes are seemingly encouraged by Russian disinformation campaigns targeting Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   Public opinion polling shows around half the population favors EU membership, which is significantly lower than support in most other potential member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### Security Concerns
A primary concern for Armenians is that the West cannot provide the security they need, especially against perceived threats from Turkey and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   Despite the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh, fears persist that Azerbaijan might try to seize southern Armenia to create a land bridge to Nakhichevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   Armenians feel the West would be unable or unwilling to prevent such an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   Despite Moscow's recent failures regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, many Armenians still believe that only Russia could prevent further territorial losses, particularly as dividing Armenia would cut off an essential link to Iran, a key Russian ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

Ultimately, most Armenians feel they must accept their current situation, caught between rival powers. While they no longer trust Russia, completely abandoning it for closer Western ties is not seen as a viable option, at least for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

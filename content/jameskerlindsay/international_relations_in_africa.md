For the past two years, significant [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international attention]] has been on the civil war in Ethiopia's northern province of Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, another major issue involving Ethiopia's completion of a massive dam on the Nile River has steadily escalated, leading to severe tensions with nearby Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite repeated diplomatic efforts, the two nations remain at loggerheads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, prompting concerns that this dispute could ignite Africa's next resource [[international_relations_and_war | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This situation exemplifies the complexities of [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international relations]], [[international_relations_and_war | conflict]], security, and statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Natural Resources as a Source of Tension

Natural resources are widely recognized as a significant source of tension and [[international_relations_and_war | conflict]] in modern [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Disputes often arise over access to energy resources like oil and gas, as well as precious metals and minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Fresh water is another crucial source of competition, used for drinking, sanitation, agriculture, and energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. As climate change impacts water supplies globally, access to water is expected to become an even greater source of instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. One of the world's most critical water access disputes is currently unfolding in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## The Nile River: A Vital Resource

The Nile River, approximately 6,700 kilometers (4,000 miles) long, is Africa's longest river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It comprises two main tributaries:
*   **The White Nile:** Originates in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, including areas of Rwanda, Kenya, and Tanzania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **The Blue Nile:** Begins in Ethiopia and converges with the White Nile in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

For Egypt, the Nile is an indispensable natural resource, providing almost 98% of the country's drinking water and virtually all water for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Consequently, Egypt is extremely sensitive to any potential disruption to the river's flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Ethiopia also considers the Nile an essential resource, with significant water needs for its largely farming-dependent population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Furthermore, as one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, Ethiopia faces massive growth in energy demand, with nearly half its population lacking access to electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The Ethiopian government views the Blue Nile's hydroelectric potential as crucial for its development goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Historical Context of Egypt-Ethiopia Relations

Egypt and Ethiopia, two of Africa's oldest countries, share links stretching back to ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Their modern diplomatic relations began in 1927, making them the first independent African countries to establish such ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Both were among the four founding African members of the United Nations in 1945, alongside South Africa and Liberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Despite this shared history, their relationship has often been strained, marked by issues such as Ethiopia's recognition of Israel in 1961 and their differing alignments during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, the management of the Nile River has been the most defining issue in their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)

Since the mid-1950s, Egypt has been increasingly concerned about Ethiopia's potential plans to build a dam on the Nile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Ethiopia had such plans but reportedly held off due to fears of Egyptian reprisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In the 1970s, Egypt explicitly threatened [[international_relations_and_war | war]] if such a project proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Voice recordings of former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak from the New Millennium even suggested Egypt would bomb any new dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The situation changed in 2011 with the Arab Spring and Mubarak's removal from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Ethiopia seized the opportunity to begin constructing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### GERD's Scale and Significance

Located less than 30 kilometers from the [[international_relations_and_state_borders | border with Sudan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, the GERD is a massive undertaking with an estimated cost exceeding US$4.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Standing almost 150 meters high, its reservoir, once fully filled after 2024, will hold 74 billion cubic meters of water and cover 1,900 square kilometers (720 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. It is set to become Africa's largest hydropower project and one of the largest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The dam symbolizes Ethiopia's growing ambitions and its strategy to alleviate poverty for millions of its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Escalating Tensions and Diplomatic Efforts

The commencement of the GERD project led to severe tensions between Ethiopia and its neighbors, Sudan and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While Sudan initially opposed the project, it later shifted its position, recognizing the potential for additional electricity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Egypt, however, maintained a much stronger stance. Cairo stated it did not object to Ethiopia's development goals but insisted that the project must consider the legitimate interests of other affected countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Failed Agreements and Accusations

Initially, an agreement seemed possible, with the signing of a declaration of principles in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, this did not lead to a comprehensive settlement, and tensions grew behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **2016:** Ethiopia accused Egypt of supporting separatist groups, including the Oromo Liberation Front, a claim vehemently denied by Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **2018:** A meeting between Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali and Egyptian leader Abdul Fatah El Sisi in Cairo offered renewed hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Abiy Ahmed publicly stated that Ethiopia would "never hurt the people of Egypt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Late 2019:** Hopes for a breakthrough faded, and relations completely broke down, with Abiy Ahmed threatening [[international_relations_and_war | war]] if Egypt acted against the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### International Mediation

In July 2020, mediation by the African Union reportedly led to "a common understanding" that could pave the way for an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. While critical aspects were addressed, key elements remained unresolved, such as water release protocols during severe droughts and the mechanism for resolving disagreements, with Ethiopia reportedly rejecting binding arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Since then, little progress has been made. Sudanese concerns have resurfaced, and Egypt has adopted a tougher stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. In 2021, Egypt's foreign minister stated that "more than a hundred million Egyptians face an existential threat" from the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Global Concern and Future Outlook

The seriousness of the GERD issue has prompted growing [[Impact on international relations | international concern]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The UN Security Council discussed the matter in 2020 and 2021, issuing a presidential statement calling for renewed negotiations under African Union auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Despite calls for diplomacy, tensions have continued to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Ethiopia has already begun filling the dam, a move heavily condemned by Egypt in a letter to the Security Council in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. More recently, Egypt accused Ethiopia of obstructing talks and has sought to raise awareness in other [[Impact on international relations | international forums]], including the African Union Summit in February 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Egypt repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot tolerate such a fundamental challenge to its interests, arguing that without an agreement, the project threatens [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international peace and security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam remains one of Africa's most serious potential flashpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While a new study based on computer modeling suggests an optimal outcome that could satisfy all three countries' concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, there is currently little indication that Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan are willing to discuss this solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. As the dam continues to fill and approaches full operational status in 2024, the issue still holds the potential to spark [[international_relations_and_war | conflict]] between two of Africa's largest, oldest, and most influential nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

In October 2023, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali initiated concerns about a new conflict in the Horn of Africa by calling for Ethiopia to have access to the strategically vital Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Neighboring Eritrea put its forces on alert, suggesting a possible return to war between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While the immediate threat has lessened, many remain concerned about a future conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This potential for renewed hostility is deeply rooted in the long and complex [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_ethiopia_eritrea_dynamics | history of relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Geography and Demographics

Ethiopia and Eritrea are located in the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Ethiopia, at 1.1 million square kilometers (425,000 square miles), is the world's 26th largest country and Africa's 10th largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It is landlocked, sharing borders with Djibouti, [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Somalia]], Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan, Eritrea, and the unrecognised Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, with 120 million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Eritrea, situated to Ethiopia's northeast, possesses a long coastline on the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It is significantly smaller, at 125,000 square kilometers (under 50,000 square miles), making it the world's 97th largest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Eritrea shares land borders with Djibouti and Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, and has a population of about 3.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The two countries also share ethnic links. Tigrayans constitute over half of Eritrea's population and are the third-largest group in Ethiopia, making up 7% to 8% of its inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## [[eritreas_history_and_colonial_past | Historical Context and Colonial Past]]

The shared history of Ethiopia and Eritrea dates back to antiquity, including the Kingdom of Axum, which encompassed modern-day Eritrea and northern Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The modern [[eritreas_history_and_colonial_past | history of Eritrea]] begins in the 19th century with European colonial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

*   **Italian Colonisation**: Italy established a trading outpost in Eritrea in 1869, expanding its presence to create the Colony of Eritrea and take control of Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Despite resisting European colonisation earlier, Ethiopia (then Abyssinia) fell under Italian control in 1936, though this was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **British Trusteeship**: In 1941, British forces and Ethiopian guerrillas defeated Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Ethiopia regained independence and became a UN founding member, while Eritrea came under British trusteeship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Federation and Annexation

Initially, Eritrea was expected to exercise self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, deep divisions emerged between its two religious communities: Muslim Eritreans favored independence, while most Christians, primarily Ethiopian Orthodox, preferred union with Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Ethiopia, desperate for Red Sea access, also desired this union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

Faced with this impasse, the UN General Assembly considered the matter and presented three options: Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea, a federation between them, or Eritrea remaining a trust territory for another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The General Assembly chose the second option, leading to the creation of the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea on September 15, 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

This union was troubled from the start. Ethiopia, being larger, more populous, and with a longer [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | history of independence]], immediately asserted itself as the senior partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Resentment grew in Eritrea, culminating in September 1961 when the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) launched an uprising against Ethiopian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. In response, Ethiopia dissolved the Federation and annexed Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Eritrean War of Independence

The ELF continued its campaign, leading to the Eritrean War of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Everything changed on September 12, 1974, when [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown]] by a Marxist military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Although the ELF split, the new Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) allied with other groups fighting the new regime, most significantly the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

As the Soviet Union collapsed, depriving the Ethiopian government of its main benefactor, the rebel forces gained the upper hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. By May 1991, the TPLF, EPLF, and their allies took control of Addis Ababa, ousting the military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Eritrean Independence

The overthrow of the military regime fundamentally transformed Eritrea's fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The EPLF established a government in Asmara and announced an independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Representatives in Addis Ababa agreed that Eritrea should not be forced to remain part of Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

In April 1993, with UN support, 99.8% of Eritreans voted for statehood on a 98% turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. On May 28, 1993, Eritrea was admitted as the 183rd member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Despite Ethiopia becoming landlocked, relations initially appeared very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Post-Independence Conflicts

### Border War (1998-2000)

Problems soon emerged, primarily concerning the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Eritrea claimed territory along the entire boundary, particularly parts of Ethiopia's Tigray province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The TPLF, dominating the new Ethiopian government, fiercely rejected these demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

War broke out on May 6, 1998, marked by extreme brutality, resulting in up to 100,000 deaths and massive displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. After two years of fighting, Ethiopia gained the upper hand, leading to a UN-monitored ceasefire in June 2000 and a formal peace deal six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

As part of the deal, a Boundary Commission was created in cooperation with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. In 2002, the Commission awarded a small Tigrayan village to Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Despite agreeing to be bound by the decision, the Ethiopian government rejected the outcome, sparking anger and ensuring tensions remained high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Abiy Ahmed's Reforms and the Tigray War

Everything changed in April 2018 with the election of Abiy Ahmed Ali as Ethiopia's reformist Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. An [[impact_of_oromoamhara_relations_on_ethiopian_politics | ethnic Oromo]], he began to push back against entrenched Tigrayan dominance in [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Two months into his term, he announced Ethiopia's agreement to accept the Border Commission's decision, earning widespread international praise and the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This led to an immediate thawing of relations with Eritrea, including a meeting between Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea's long-standing totalitarian president, Isaias Afwerki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

However, the decision caused outrage in Tigray, where the TPLF still dominated local politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Tensions escalated in 2020 when Tigray pushed ahead with its regional elections despite Ethiopia postponing national elections due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. With neither side recognizing the other's legitimacy, Abiy Ahmed sent the Ethiopian National Defense Force to retake control of Tigray in November 2020, leading to the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Tigray War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Abiy Ahmed's improved relations with Eritrea paid off, as Afwerki, holding a deep hatred for the TPLF, quickly offered support to Addis Ababa, providing sanctuary to Ethiopian troops fleeing into Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The TPLF launched rocket attacks on Eritrea following reports that Eritrea had allowed Ethiopia to launch attacks from its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Within months, reports emerged of [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrean forces assisting the Ethiopian Army]] in Tigray, with subsequent claims of atrocities, war crimes, and possibly crimes against humanity committed by Eritrean troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Despite this joint cooperation, Tigrayan forces staged a comeback, at one point appearing poised to seize Addis Ababa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. However, in 2022, with renewed support from Eritrean forces, Ethiopian troops pushed the Tigrayans back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. As the Ethiopian Army neared retaking Mekelle, the Tigrayan capital, the African Union brokered a peace deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This agreement led to the surrender and demobilization of TPLF forces, Ethiopia reasserting control, and a promise of proper representation for Tigray in national institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## Renewed Concerns (October 2023)

Renewed concern about a return to war is driven by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Despite allying with the Ethiopian government during the recent war, Eritrea was excluded from the peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. There are also claims that Eritrean troops remain in Tigray, leading to soured relations between Asmara and Addis Ababa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The immediate cause for concern was Abiy Ahmed's speech on October 15, 2023, where he stated that Ethiopia, one of Africa's fastest-developing economies, should assert its rights to access the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Many Ethiopians still regard Eritrea as a historic part of their country, which immediately sparked fears of an Ethiopian invasion of Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. As Eritrean forces moved close to the border, Ethiopia responded in kind, raising concerns of imminent conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

However, this appeared to be a false alarm. Ten days later, Abiy Ahmed addressed the National Defense Forces, insisting that Ethiopia would not pursue its interests by force or attack "its fellow brothers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Nevertheless, given the long [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_ethiopia_eritrea_dynamics | history of tensions]] and Ethiopia's persistent wish for maritime access, many still question whether the two countries might indeed be heading towards another war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

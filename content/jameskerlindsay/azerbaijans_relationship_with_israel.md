The increasingly close relationship between Azerbaijan and Israel has been cemented by the 2020 [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Armenia-Azerbaijan War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>, and is a significant factor in the sharp rise in tensions between [[iran_azerbaijan_relations_and_tensions | Iran and Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic and Historical Ties

The ties between Azerbaijan and Israel are not new, having steadily developed since Azerbaijan gained its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. In April 1992, the two countries officially established diplomatic relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This made Azerbaijan one of the relatively few Muslim-majority states at the time to recognize the Jewish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

This recognition was one of the first factors that led to a [[iran_azerbaijan_relations_and_tensions | deterioration of relations]] between Baku and Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Defence Cooperation

Since their initial diplomatic engagement, the links between Azerbaijan and Israel have grown steadily stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. A key aspect of this relationship is close defence cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Israel supplied many of the sophisticated weaponry, including drones, that Azerbaijan used in the November 2020 War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

## Iran's Concerns

This growing cooperation between Azerbaijan and Israel is a significant concern for Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. Iran views this relationship as providing Israel with a strategic foothold on its northern border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. This perceived threat contributes to the current [[iran_azerbaijan_relations_and_tensions | heightened tensions]] between the two Shia Muslim nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

Hugo Chávez's presidency marked a significant period of economic, social, and political change in [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Starting under his leadership, and accelerating under his successor, [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Nicolas Maduro]], [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] went from being one of South America's richest and most democratic states to an impoverished, authoritarian, and isolated country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Rise to Power
In 1992, Hugo Chávez, then a young left-wing military officer, launched a coup against the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Although the uprising failed and Chávez was imprisoned, he was pardoned just a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Following his release, he established his own political party, the Fifth Republic Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In 1998, he successfully contested and won the country's presidential election, securing 56 percent of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Domestic Policies
Upon assuming office, Chávez initiated a radical agenda of economic, social, and political reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Buoyed by rising global oil prices, he significantly increased public spending on healthcare and education, and launched ambitious public infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Key aspects of his domestic policy included:
*   **Nationalization**: Chávez nationalized parts of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Personnel Changes**: He began to place inexperienced political allies into critical sectors, notably the country's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

While his popularity grew among the poor, these policies led to increasing opposition from [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s middle and wealthy classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly forced from power by a military coup, but his supporters quickly mobilized, causing the uprising to collapse, and Chávez returned to power within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Undeterred, he continued with his radical domestic agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Economic Challenges
Despite continued high international oil prices, [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s increasingly poorly managed oil industry suffered from low investment and poor maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This resulted in a decline in oil production and a slowdown in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## International Relations
Chávez became an increasingly high-profile figure on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He was an outspoken advocate for the developing world and openly criticized the United States, which he accused of orchestrating the 2002 coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. As tensions grew between Washington and Moscow, Chávez strengthened [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Succession
Hugo Chávez died in March 2013 after a long illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. He was immediately succeeded by his vice president, [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Nicolas Maduro]], who was firmly committed to continuing Chávez's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

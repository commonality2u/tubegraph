As 2023 concluded, concerns grew that Venezuela might be preparing to invade neighboring Guyana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This escalation is part of a decades-long [[venezuelan_guyanese_border_dispute | disputed border]] issue, despite an ongoing case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Caracas appears increasingly intent on seizing the disputed territory by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An invasion by Venezuela would have significant geopolitical consequences, challenging established international norms and potentially reshaping global relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Violation of International Law and Norms

An invasion by Venezuela would constitute a fundamental violation of international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The territory under dispute is internationally accepted as belonging to Guyana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, and the matter is currently before the ICJ, which decided it has the authority to hear the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The ICJ has already called on Venezuela to refrain from actions that could modify the situation or aggravate the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

The principle that colonial boundaries should become the borders of newly independent states has been broadly respected since decolonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This means there are remarkably few postcolonial border disputes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. A Venezuelan invasion would challenge this established principle.

## International Response and Sanctions

An invasion would lead to an international outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Many countries and international actors, including the United States and the European Union, would almost certainly impose economic and political sanctions on Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Guyana has already initiated intensive diplomatic contacts with regional partners and significant [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | international actors]], including the United States, which has expressed full support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Guyana has also referred the issue to the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

However, it remains unclear whether any steps would be taken to reverse the act by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## Influence of Russia

Venezuela's emergence as one of Russia's staunchest international supporters could significantly impact the international response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Given Russia's attempted annexation of parts of Ukraine following its [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]], the Russian government could potentially block any Security Council resolution condemning a Venezuelan invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While a General Assembly vote might still be possible, Russia's veto power at the Security Council could mitigate severe international condemnation for Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Venezuela's Strategic Calculations

Facing domestic difficulties, President Nicholas Maduro might decide to weather any immediate international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This calculation could be influenced by a perceived lack of military response from the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Venezuela's leadership may take a longer-term view, similar to Russia's potential belief that the international community will eventually accept its annexations, at least tacitly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The vice president of Guyana has acknowledged this possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

The shift in Venezuela's stance on the border issue has accelerated in late 2023, following the discovery of oil in Essequibo in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This coincided with Guyana's rapid economic development due to its significant oil deposits, contrasting sharply with Venezuela's collapsing economy under Maduro's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Impact on the Global Order

If Venezuela launches an attack and does so with relative impunity, it would deliver another major blow to the accepted global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. A successful [[venezuelas_intentions_to_annex_guyanese_territory | Venezuelan invasion]] could encourage other states to question seemingly settled borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This previously obscure dispute could emerge as another step toward fundamentally reshaping international relations in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Neighboring Brazil has already moved its forces closer to the border, indicating its nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country, faced a significant military offensive in its northernmost province, Tigray, on November 4, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This event, which occurred as global attention was focused on the US presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, raised concerns that [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | Ethiopia]] might be sliding into civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The crisis followed months of [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions]] with the local government in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Background on Ethiopia

[[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | Ethiopia]] is located in East Africa, bordered by Somalia, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It is the 27th largest UN member by area, at 1.1 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, and has a population of 115 million, making it the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Ethnic Composition
The country is home to over 80 distinct languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> and numerous ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
*   **Oromo**: The largest group, approximately 35% of the population, located in the central, southern, and western parts of the country in the Oromia region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Amhara**: Around 27% of Ethiopians, centered in the northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Somalis**: About 6% of the population, located in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Tigrayans**: About 6% of the population, located in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Historical Context
[[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]], historically known as Abyssinia, is one of the world's oldest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It maintained its independence during the European scramble for Africa in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> and was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

[[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopia]] is no stranger to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. From 1974 to 1991, it experienced a brutal civil war that led to a famine causing over 1.5 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Despite hopes for a new era of prosperity with significant GDP growth in 2018-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for efforts to settle borders with [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, the country has never been entirely at peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Other conflicts include:
*   A two-year war with [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] from 1998 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   A nearly 25-year conflict with [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | ethnic Somali separatists]] of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), which ended with a peace agreement in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   An ongoing half-century separatist conflict in Oromia, where the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) launched an attack in November 2020 that left over 54 ethnic Amhara dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Numerous other cases of unrest across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Origins of the Current Crisis

The roots of the current [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tension]] lie in a long civil war from the 1970s and 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This conflict began on September 12, 1974, when Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a Marxist military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Various movements, notably the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), rose in opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The TPLF allied with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), the main Eritrean independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

By May 1991, rebel forces led by the TPLF seized the capital, Addis Ababa, overthrowing the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This led to significant changes:
*   [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   [[ethnicity_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | Ethiopia]] was reorganized along federal lines, officially becoming the [[ethnicity_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Its new constitution uniquely permitted secession, outlining a path for constituent parts to become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Nominally democratic, the country functioned as a one-party state under the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), an alliance including the TPLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Despite representing only 6% of the population, Tigrayans held dominant roles in the federal government, including the prime minister's post, held by Meles Zenawi from 1995 to 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Escalating [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | Tensions]] with Tigray

This political dominance shifted in 2018 when Abiy Ahmed Ali, an ethnic Oromo, assumed leadership of the EPRDF after major protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This marginalized Tigrayans from the government and military they had long dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Concerns arose that the new prime minister's calls for national unity aimed to undermine the country's federal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, and he began to exhibit authoritarian tendencies, including harsh measures on freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

In 2019, the EPRDF was dissolved and replaced by the Prosperity Party; the TPLF notably refused to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Spark for Confrontation
The immediate trigger for the current confrontation was a dispute over national and regional elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Elections, originally scheduled for August 2020, were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the government extended the mandate of lawmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   The TPLF-controlled government in Tigray rejected this, deeming it evidence of increasing authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, and proceeded to hold regional elections in September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   Relations deteriorated as neither the federal government nor the Tigray regional administration recognized the other's legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   Tigray withdrew its representatives from federal institutions in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   The Ethiopian upper house voted to withhold budget subsidies to Tigray, leading to threats from Tigray to withhold tax receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   Tigray blocked a federal attempt to reshuffle military leadership in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The most serious incident occurred in early November 2020 when a federal military barracks in Tigray was attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali accused the TPLF of orchestrating the attack to steal equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, stating that the "last red line has been crossed" and the federal government was "forced into military confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The Ethiopian National Defence Forces were ordered to "save the country and the region from spiralling into instability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Hours later, a six-month state of emergency was declared in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | Potential Consequences of Conflict]]

The situation in Tigray remains unclear, as the government has shut down electricity, telephone, and internet connections to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Regional and international observers are concerned that this could spark a full-scale civil war and potentially lead to the country's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The situation is particularly worrying because Tigray is home to a large proportion of [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | Ethiopia's]] troops and weaponry, and the TPLF maintains its own forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This makes a direct confrontation with Tigray significantly different from other insurgencies faced by the Ethiopian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Wider Implications
If the conflict escalates, it could have dramatic effects across [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | Ethiopia]] and the wider region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Fears exist that neighboring states, such as [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]], might become involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. There is also an obvious humanitarian issue, as serious fighting could lead to significant refugee outflows into neighboring regions, feeding wider regional instability across the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

The Tigray Crisis marks a significantly more serious development for [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The escalating [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions]] between the federal government and the TPLF, a formerly dominant force in Ethiopian politics that retains control of the Tigray region, have the potential to spiral out of control into a full-scale civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This poses a very real threat to peace and security in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

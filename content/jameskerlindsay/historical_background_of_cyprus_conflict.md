Cyprus, a Mediterranean island known for its history, resorts, and scenery, has also been the scene of bitter and brutal fighting in the 1960s and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It remains one of the most entrenched [[ethnic_conflict_in_cyprus|ethnic conflicts]] in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The island still hosts the longest-running major [[united_nations_peacekeeping_in_cyprus|United Nations peacemaking and peacekeeping mission]] in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. After almost 60 years of efforts, many question if the [[cyprus_dispute_and_its_impact|Cyprus Dispute]] can still be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Geographical and Political Overview

Cyprus is located at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It measures 9,250 square kilometres (around 3,500 square miles), making it the 162nd largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

While the Republic of Cyprus is the only internationally recognized state on the island, the country is divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), recognized only by Turkey, occupies about 36 to 37 percent of the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Additionally, Britain maintains two large military bases in Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The island's population is believed to be around 1.2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The exact numbers and proportions of Greek and Turkish Cypriots are highly contested due to a steady flow of settlers from mainland Turkey to the north since the island was divided in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Most analysts refer to the demographic balance from 1960 when the island gained independence:
*   Greek Cypriots: 78 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Turkish Cypriots: 18 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   Maronites, Armenians, and Latins (three small religious communities): 4 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>

## Ancient History and Foreign Rule

Cyprus has a rich history, situated at the meeting point of Europe, Asia, and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It was first settled by Bronze Age Greeks around three to four thousand years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Over millennia, it came under the rule of various empires and powers:
*   Egyptian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Persian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Roman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Arab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Byzantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Crusader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Venetian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

A significant turning point occurred in 1571 when the island was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, leading to the arrival of the first Turkish inhabitants â€“ the ancestors of today's Turkish Cypriot community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## British Rule and Nationalistic Movements

In 1878, the Ottomans passed administrative control of Cyprus to Britain as part of a defence pact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. From this point, the island's majority Greek Christian inhabitants began calling for Cyprus to be united with the Kingdom of Greece, a national ambition known as *enosis* (union) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Britain initially refused, citing Ottoman sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Even after the new Republic of Turkey relinquished its claim and Cyprus became a British Crown Colony in 1925, Britain continued to reject calls for enosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

In 1955, Greek Cypriot patience led to an armed campaign to end British rule and achieve enosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This, in turn, sparked calls from Turkish Cypriots for Cyprus to be partitioned between Greece and Turkey, a policy known as *taksim* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Independence and Early Conflict

As Cyprus neared civil war in early 1959, Greece and Turkey reached a historic compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Cyprus would become an independent state with a power-sharing arrangement between the two communities, guaranteed by Greece, Turkey, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The Republic of Cyprus formally came into existence on August 16, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Despite hopes for a fresh start, tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. While Turkish Cypriots largely accepted the new republic, many Greek Cypriots resented being denied union with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The power-sharing system soon came under strain over issues such as local government organization and the division of the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

This culminated in December 1963 when fighting erupted after Turkey rejected Greek Cypriot proposals for constitutional change, leading to the collapse of the joint government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Peace was restored in March 1964 with the establishment of a [[united_nations_peacekeeping_in_cyprus|United Nations peacekeeping force]] on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. However, UN-led efforts to broker a political agreement over the next decade yielded little progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## The 1974 Turkish Invasion and Division

In July 1974, violence erupted again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The military regime in Greece attempted to overthrow the Cypriot government in a final desperate attempt to secure enosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Turkey, using its guarantor rights, invaded the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This resulted in approximately 200,000 Greek and Turkish Cypriots being forced from their homes, and Cyprus was left divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Post-Invasion Developments

In the years following the 1974 division, the UN continued its efforts to reach a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In 1977, both sides agreed that any solution would be based on a federal arrangement consisting of two territorial units broadly corresponding to the two communities, known as the bizonal, bicommunal federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Despite this agreement, in November 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This move was condemned by the UN Security Council, which called on member states not to recognize the new entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Talks continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s but remained deadlocked, largely due to the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leadership, backed by Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

By 2000, as Cyprus prepared to join the European Union, a major new UN initiative was launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In 2004, the UN proposed a plan for reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Although widely endorsed by the international community and accepted by two-thirds of Turkish Cypriots, the proposals were rejected by three-quarters of Greek Cypriots in a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Since then, settlement efforts have continued, with the most recent major initiative being a UN-convened conference in 2017, which also failed to achieve a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Today, many observers feel that a settlement for [[prospects_for_reunification_of_cyprus|reunification]] is increasingly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Key Issues at Stake

Three key points of difference continue to hinder a resolution:

*   **[[governance_and_political_disagreements_in_cyprus|Governance]]**: This concerns the structure of a federal state and how communities would be represented. Turkish Cypriots insist on political equality and resistance to being sidelined, while Greek Cypriots demand a functional state where the minority cannot tyrannize the majority, and a guarantee against future secession attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Territory and Property**: Currently, 36-37 percent of the island is under Turkish Cypriot control, but observers believe this would need to be reduced to 25-29 percent in a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Questions remain about the return of Greek Cypriots to their original properties in the north, or compensation for those who cannot or do not wish to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Security**: Under the 1960 settlement, Greece and Turkey were permitted to station troops and had the right to intervene in threats to constitutional order, as occurred in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Greek Cypriots insist these provisions must be removed, while many Turkish Cypriots see the presence of Turkish troops and intervention rights as essential security guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Other issues include the status of Turkish settlers, the nature of any future peacekeeping force, and the management of transitional arrangements to a new federal deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

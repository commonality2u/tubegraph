In June 2021, Nigeria garnered international attention after banning Twitter following the platform's deletion of a tweet from the country's president. The tweet referenced the Biafra War of the 1960s and suggested the government might use force against resurgent separatist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident highlighted the ongoing [[ethnic_and_religious_tensions_in_nigeria | ethnic and religious tensions]] within the country, particularly concerning the Biafran independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Historical Background and the Biafran War

Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the continent's most populous country with approximately 200 million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Its population comprises numerous ethnic groups, most notably the predominantly Muslim Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Christian and Muslim Yoruba in the southwest, and the predominantly Christian Igbo in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The origins of these tensions trace back to British colonization in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Initially, Nigeria was divided into two distinct colonies: the Muslim-dominated Northern Nigerian Protectorate and the predominantly Christian Southern Nigerian Protectorate. These two were merged in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. In 1954, the country was formally constituted as a federation of three regions, roughly aligning with the main ethnic groups: the Hausa-Fulani dominated Northern Region, the Yoruba-dominated Western Region, and the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Nigeria gained independence in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Tensions quickly emerged following disputed elections, leading to a military coup in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This coup resulted in the assassination of many political figures, including the popular premier of the Northern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. In retaliation, thousands of ethnic Igbo living in the north were murdered, prompting over a million others to flee south to the Eastern Region, which in turn fueled calls for secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Despite a supposed deal for a looser federal arrangement in early 1967, the federal government appeared to renege by announcing a plan to divide the three regions into 12 new parts, perceived as an attempt to undermine the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Consequently, the Eastern Region's leader, Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, declared independence on May 30, 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The Nigerian government launched a full-scale invasion to quell the secession six weeks later, leading to the Biafran War (also known as the Nigerian Civil War) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This conflict became a humanitarian catastrophe, with an estimated one to three million people dying from hunger as supplies to the breakaway region were cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. By January 1970, the Nigerian government, supported by international allies including Britain and the Soviet Union, defeated the resistance, and the Republic of Biafra ceased to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Resurgence of Biafran Sentiment

In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Federal Government called for national unity under a policy known as the "Three R's": reintegration, reconciliation, and reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Initially, the trauma of the war seemed to suppress Igbo independence sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

However, by the late 1990s, this began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. New generations emerged with no direct experience of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Despite the official policy, many Igbo felt they continued to face hostility and discrimination, being systematically shut out of key jobs and political offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Furthermore, there was a perception of deliberate neglect of economic development in the region, with lower federal funding and fewer infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Another contributing factor was the emergence of [[security_threats_and_violence_in_nigeria | conflict in the Niger Delta]] in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Although the Delta, largely within the claimed Biafran territory, became Sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil-producing region, local communities saw little revenue and suffered immense environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This sense of marginalization, coupled with exploitation and repression, reignited the Biafran independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

In 1999, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Subsequently, other groups emerged, most notably the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. His media outlet, Radio Biafra, became a leading voice for the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Government Crackdown and Escalation

The Nigerian Government consistently cracked down on neo-Biafran sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. MASSOB membership was outlawed in 2005, and its leader was arrested in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Current tensions intensified around 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The election of President Muhammadu Buhari, a former general from the Muslim North, signaled an intention to focus on his supporters and crack down on separatist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Simultaneously, the arrest of IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu in October 2015 on sedition and treason charges sparked widespread protests, which escalated into violence and harsh repression by government forces, including the use of deadly force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Although Kanu was later released on bail, these events strengthened IPOB's standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. In 2017, IPOB was officially designated a terrorist organization by the Nigerian Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Herder-Farmer Conflict

Since then, tensions in the southeast have been exacerbated by the Herder-Farmer Conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. As [[impact_of_climate_change_on_conflicts_in_nigeria | climate change]] leads to desertification in the north, Muslim Fulani cattle herders have increasingly moved south into lands held by settled farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This conflict has resulted in over 10,000 deaths and tens of thousands displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. President Buhari, himself a Fulani, has been accused of not doing enough to stop these attacks, particularly as herders encroach on Igbo territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Following deadly clashes in late 2020, IPOB established an armed wing, the Eastern Security Network, ostensibly to defend against herder attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This has led to further violence with government forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, ultimately sparking the controversial tweet by President Buhari that led to Nigeria's Twitter ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Challenges and Outlook

The Biafran independence movement faces significant opposition from the Federal Government and internal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Opinion within the Igbo community is divided, with growing support among disaffected youth but caution or opposition from older members who recall the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Practical issues also persist, including the unclear boundaries of a potential Biafran state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. While some advocate for including all areas claimed in the 1960s, others focus on a core group of Igbo-dominated states in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. However, a smaller state would be landlocked and exclude key oil-producing areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Independence is also opposed by many non-Igbo groups who wish to remain part of Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Currently, there is little indication that the government will concede to demands for a referendum or permit secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The government remains determined to suppress Biafran independence sentiment, particularly as it faces [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | separatist challenges elsewhere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Growing fears exist that IPOB's new militancy could lead to an increasingly violent phase in the independence campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The resurgence of the Biafran movement is fueled by a deep sense of marginalization and government neglect, intensified by internal tensions between the Muslim North and Christian South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, and exacerbated by the [[impact_of_climate_change_on_conflicts_in_nigeria | climate change-driven Herder-Farmer conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. While a new Biafran War seems unlikely, a major new Biafran conflict remains a distinct possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

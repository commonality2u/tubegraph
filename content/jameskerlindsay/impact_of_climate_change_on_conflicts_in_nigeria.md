Climate change has played a role in exacerbating existing tensions and fueling conflicts in Nigeria, particularly in the southeast region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. This is primarily observed through the "Herder-Farmer Conflict" or "Herder War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

## Herder-Farmer Conflict

Desertification in northern Nigeria, intensified by climate change, has compelled Muslim Fulani cattle herders to move south into areas traditionally held by settled farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This encroachment has led to violent clashes, resulting in over 10,000 deaths and the displacement of tens of thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

### Exacerbating Biafran Independence Movement
The herders' expansion into Igbo territory has significantly contributed to rising tensions in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Critics accuse President Muhammadu Buhari, who is Fulani, of not doing enough to halt these attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Following deadly clashes in late 2020, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) established an armed wing, the Eastern Security Network, which they claim was to defend against herder attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. This has led to further violence with government forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

The conflict, "seemingly fed by climate change," contributes to [[ethnic_tensions_in_nigeria | internal tensions]] between the Muslim North and Christian South, fostering a "deep sense of marginalization and government neglect" that fuels the resurgent Biafran independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

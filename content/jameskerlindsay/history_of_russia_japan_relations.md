While global attention has been directed toward Russia's war in Ukraine, a persistent territorial dispute in Russia's east has seen recent escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Senior Japanese officials have recently reaffirmed their country's claim to the southern Kuril Islands, raising concerns about potential new conflict on Russia's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

A long-standing issue in modern international relations involves Russia and Japan, which, almost eight decades after the end of the Second World War, have yet to conclude a formal peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This ongoing disagreement centers on the strategically important southern Kuril Islands, which are rich in mineral and energy reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Geographical Context

Russia is the world's largest country, spanning 17 million square kilometers (6.6 million square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Japan, by contrast, is the 62nd largest of the 193 UN members, covering 380,000 square kilometers (145,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. In terms of population, Russia has approximately 144 million people, while Japan has about 125 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The two nations are neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. At their closest uncontested point, the southern tip of Russia's Sakhalin Island is just 43 kilometers (28 miles) from the northern point of Hokkaido, Japan's most northerly main island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The Kuril Islands are an archipelago consisting of 56 main volcanic islands and numerous islets, stretching about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) between northeast Hokkaido and Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Historical Developments

### 19th Century Expansion and Treaties

While Russia and Japan are close neighbors now, this was not always the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. After pushing eastward and conquering Siberia in the 17th century, Russia expanded into East Asia in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This expansion, including the seizure of territory from China in the 1850s, led to direct confrontation with Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Key agreements include:
*   **Treaty of Shimoda (1855)**: Russia and Japan agreed to share Sakhalin Island, with Russia taking the north and Japan the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. They also divided control of the Kuril Islands; Russia took islands north of Urup, while Japan gained sovereignty over the three main southern islands—Iturup, Kunashir, and Shikotan—along with the Habomai Islets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Treaty of St. Petersburg (1875)**: Two decades later, Russia took control of all of Sakhalin in exchange for ceding the entire Kuril Island chain to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905)

Tensions between Japan and Russia escalated, culminating in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Russia's defeat was unprecedented for a European power, forcing Moscow to cede much of its Far Eastern territory, including the southern half of Sakhalin Island, to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This war had significant regional and international implications, paving the way for Japan's occupation of Korea and Chinese Manchuria, and is also seen by many as a catalyst for the Russian Revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### World War II and Soviet Occupation

Rivalry between Japan and the Soviet Union intensified in the following decades, leading to an undeclared war in 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Although the USSR won, its focus shifted to Europe, leading to the signing of a neutrality pact in April 1941, which allowed Japan to turn its attention toward the United States later that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

In early 1945, after the defeat of Nazi Germany, pressure grew for the Soviet Union to join the war in the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, invading the southern half of Sakhalin Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Despite Japan's surrender on August 15, the Soviet Union continued to take the Kuril Islands, and by early September 1945, the entire island chain was under Russian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The Soviet Union quickly solidified its control, expelling Japanese inhabitants from the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Post-War Relations and the 1956 Peace Declaration

By the mid-1950s, the relationship between the two countries began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. On October 19, 1956, Moscow and Tokyo signed a landmark peace declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This declaration formally ended the state of war, re-established diplomatic relations, and committed both sides to settling future disputes peacefully, dropping compensation claims, and negotiating agreements on trade and fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Crucially, however, they were unable to sign a formal peace treaty due to their ongoing differences over the Kuril Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While the declaration explicitly stated that the two southernmost parts of the islands—Shikotan and the Habomai Islets—would be returned to Japan upon the conclusion of a final peace treaty, Japan insisted on sovereignty over all four of its "Northern Territories" (Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islets), which were originally ceded to it in 1855 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Efforts to resolve the northern boundary issue proved fruitless in the decades that followed, and a final peace treaty was not signed by the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Post-Cold War Developments

With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Japan called on the newly independent Russian Federation to formally return the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Moscow, however, was reluctant, partly arguing that Japan's close alliance with the United States could lead to the militarization of the islands if returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Russia's reluctance was also shaped by the islands' economic value, including extensive fishing waters and significant oil and gas reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Russia's determination to retain the islands was highlighted in 2010 when Dmitry Medvedev became the first Russian leader to visit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

By 2016, a shift seemed possible with closer commercial links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a summit, reaching an eight-point agreement to promote economic cooperation and seemingly agreeing that the Kuril Islands question remained open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Another summit two years later agreed that talks should be based on the 1956 peace declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

However, hopes for progress were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In 2020, Russia introduced a constitutional amendment explicitly outlawing any moves to relinquish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Simultaneously, Russia steadily increased its military presence on the islands, installing sophisticated anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. In July 2021, the Russian Prime Minister visited Iturup, an island directly claimed by Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. While Tokyo protested, Russian politicians made it clear that Moscow now considered the issue closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Recent Escalation and [[prospects_for_a_russia_japan_peace_treaty | Prospects for a Russia-Japan Peace Treaty]]

This issue resurfaced on February 28, 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Hideki Uyama, Europe director at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, told parliamentarians that Russia was in occupation of the Northern Territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Russia responded by stating the islands were legally transferred as "punishment for Japan's aggression and its alliance with Nazi Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. In a clear departure from the Abe-era language, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi openly called the islands an integral part of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Washington affirmed its support for Japan's claims, a stance held since the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Escalation continued as Putin signed an amendment exempting businesses on the islands from corporate, property, and land taxes for up to 20 years, a decision condemned by Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Japan's decision to join Western sanctions on Russia further strained relations, leading Moscow to add Japan to its list of "unfriendly countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This has prompted speculation of reprisals, such as banning Japanese fishing vessels from the waters around the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Tokyo has also increased its monitoring of Russian military activity in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Prospects for Conflict or Settlement

Despite these developments, direct conflict seems highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Japan is not expected to invade the islands, even with Russia's military preoccupied elsewhere, as Russia remains a nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:04]</a>. Japan will avoid steps that could be perceived as a direct attack on Russian territory, similar to how NATO avoids direct intervention in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

The wider view suggests that the conflict in Ukraine will make the Kuril Islands dispute more difficult to resolve in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Russia has already announced the suspension of peace talks with Japan over the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, this does not mean the matter is closed indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. At some point, Russia will likely emerge from its current economic isolation and may need to rebuild ties with Western countries, including Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This could create an opportunity for negotiations leading to a final settlement, though much will depend on the outcomes within Russia following the end of the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Over 75 years after the end of the Second World War, Japan and Russia still lack a full and final peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The question remains whether the new conflict in Europe might eventually create an opportunity to resolve this long-standing issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

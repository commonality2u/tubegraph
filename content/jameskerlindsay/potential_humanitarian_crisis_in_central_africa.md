A potential humanitarian crisis is emerging in [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Central Africa]], driven by escalating conflict between [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]] and the [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Fears are growing that a full-scale war could erupt between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Current Escalation
In late January 2025, news emerged that rebel forces, reportedly backed by [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwandan troops]], entered the capital of one of the eastern provinces in the [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Democratic Republic of the Congo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This incursion forced thousands of people to flee the escalating crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The UN Security Council has called for [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]] to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

On January 27, 2025, M23 fighters entered Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, amidst heavy clashes that killed 13 South African peacekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. As thousands flee the area, there are reports that rebel forces are heading for Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. These clashes are considered the most serious in over a dozen years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Allegations suggest that large numbers of well-armed and well-trained [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwandan]] troops have openly joined the fight alongside M23 rebels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | DRC]] President Tshisekedi has announced a massive military mobilization, stating that the two countries would be at war unless [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]] withdraws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. South Africa, an ally of [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Congo]], has also warned [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]] against further action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Historical Context
The eastern [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Congo]] region has been marred by conflict for many years, with various rebel groups fighting for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17">[01:17]</a>. The situation dramatically escalated as [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwandan]] forces entered the fray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a>.

A significant event contributing to regional instability was the 1994 genocide in [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]], which led to the flight of thousands of Hutu fighters into neighboring [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Congo]] (then Zaire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>. This subsequently sparked the First [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Congo]] War in October 1996, when [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]] and Uganda invaded the [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | DRC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35">[05:35]</a>. The Second [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Congo]] War, also known as the Great War of Africa, began when [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Congo]] sought support from other African countries, including Angola, Chad, Namibia, [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | Sudan]], and Zimbabwe, against [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwandan]] and Ugandan forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13">[06:13]</a>.

Unrest continued in the east, particularly in North and South Kivu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04">[07:04]</a>. Key [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwandan]] factions emerged, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]] (FDLR), formed by Hutu militants, and M23, composed of Tutsi mutineers from the Congolese army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29">[07:29]</a>. [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwandan]] President Paul Kagame has supported M23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54">[07:54]</a>.

In November 2021, M23 resumed its activities, launching attacks that killed hundreds and displaced over 200,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39">[08:39]</a>. The UN has openly accused [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | Rwanda]] of supporting M23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10">[09:10]</a>.

### Humanitarian Concerns
There is a serious and immediate humanitarian dimension to the escalating conflict in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41">[12:41]</a>. There are real fears that [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Congo]] and [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Central Africa]] more generally may be plunged into another devastating war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44">[12:44]</a>. Such a conflict could result in tens of thousands killed and potentially millions displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54">[12:54]</a>.

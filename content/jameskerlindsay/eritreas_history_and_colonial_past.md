Eritrea, located in Northeast Africa, is a state of approximately 120,000 square kilometers (around 45,000 square miles) with a Red Sea coastline to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>. It shares borders with Djibouti to the southeast, Sudan to the northwest, and its longest land border is with [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. While its precise population is unknown due to a lack of official figures, the UN estimates it has about three and a half million inhabitants, divided roughly equally between Orthodox Christians and Sunni Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. Despite being resource-rich with gold and copper, its estimated per capita GDP is around $700 USD, making it one of Africa’s poorest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Ancient Roots and European Colonial Expansion

Eritrea's history dates back to ancient times, given its strategic location on the Red Sea, a vital global trading route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. However, its modern history is largely shaped by the expansion of European colonialism in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

After establishing a trading presence, the Kingdom of Italy formally established the colony of Eritrea in 1890 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This colonial rule continued until the mid-1930s when Italy conquered [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]], uniting it with Eritrea and Somaliland to form Italian East Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This Italian dominion was short-lived, as British troops, aided by Ethiopian guerrillas, forced Italy to withdraw from the region during the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Post-World War II and the Federation with Ethiopia

Following Italy's withdrawal, Eritrea's path diverged from its former partners. [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] regained its independence and became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945, while Italian Somaliland was returned to Italian rule in 1949 before gaining independence in 1960 as part of the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Eritrea, however, remained under British administration, eventually becoming a UN trust territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

As decolonization gained momentum, it was expected that Eritrea would also be granted the right to self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. However, the Eritrean population was internally divided on its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The Muslim community sought independence or, failing that, continued UN trusteeship under British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. In contrast, the Christian community, being members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, favored union with neighboring [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

Crucially, the Ethiopian Emperor, Haile Selassie, actively promoted the union option, asserting historical claims over the area and seeing it as a vital opportunity for landlocked [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] to gain access to the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

Faced with these divisions, the UN General Assembly established a commission to investigate the matter, but it failed to reach a consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Ultimately, three options were considered:
*   Direct annexation of Eritrea by [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>
*   A federation between [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] and Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
*   Eritrea continuing under UN trusteeship pending full independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>

Under pressure from Western-aligned [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] and with British and American backing, the General Assembly recommended the federal settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. On September 15, 1952, the two entities united to form the Federation of [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] and Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Annexation and the War for Independence

From its inception, the new state was an unequal union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]], being significantly larger and with a long history of independence, naturally regarded itself as the dominant partner, leading to considerable Eritrean discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. This discontent escalated into open conflict in September 1961 when the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), an armed group, launched a revolt against Ethiopian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. In response, [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] dissolved the federation and formally annexed Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

The Eritrean war for independence persisted over the following decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. In September 1974, a significant turn of events occurred when Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown, bringing [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] under the rule of a Marxist military dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. As [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] plunged into civil war, the ELF allied with other rebel groups to oppose the new regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

In the late 1970s, the ELF experienced a split, leading to the emergence of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) under the leadership of [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. The EPLF quickly became the dominant Eritrean faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. The fighting continued throughout the 1980s, but the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the decade deprived the Ethiopian military regime of its key benefactor, shifting the balance in favor of the rebels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. In late May 1991, rebel forces entered Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, and overthrew the military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

## Independence and Early Hopes

The overthrow of the Ethiopian regime marked a decisive moment for Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. The EPLF announced plans for an independence referendum, and its former rebel partners, who now formed the new Ethiopian government, acknowledged that Eritrea could no longer be held in the union against its will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

In April 1993, Eritreans overwhelmingly voted for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Just one month later, in May 1993, the state of Eritrea joined the United Nations as the world’s newest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Initially, there were hopes that Eritrea would develop into a modern democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Under [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]], who became president, the new country received significant international support, and a draft constitution unveiled in 1997 enshrined democracy and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

However, these hopes for democracy soon broke down. In 1998, a border dispute led to Eritrea invading [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]], sparking a brutal two-year war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Although the conflict ended in 2000, ongoing tensions with [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopia]] resulted in Eritrea remaining highly militarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. From this point, [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] tightened his grip on power, leading to the country's current status as one of the most repressive nations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

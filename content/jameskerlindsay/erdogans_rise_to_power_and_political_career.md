Since 2002, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has been the dominant force in Turkish politics, leading to [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | a complete transformation of the country]] and its international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His tenure has seen Turkey move in a "troubling direction," marked by increasing authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Early Life and Entry into Politics

[[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] was born on February 26, 1954, in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He spent most of his youth on the Black Sea coast before returning to Istanbul as a teenager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He attended an Islamic school and became involved in politics as a student, joining a religious party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Over several decades, he rose through the ranks of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Mayor of Istanbul and Imprisonment

In 1994, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] became the mayor of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. However, his religious beliefs led to his imprisonment for four months in 1998, after reciting a poem at a rally that critics deemed a call to religious violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Formation of the AKP and Political Ascent

Despite his conviction, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] continued his political career after release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. In 2001, he became the head of a new political movement, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

In November 2002, following an economic and constitutional crisis, the AKP secured an overwhelming victory in a general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Due to his prior conviction, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] was initially unable to stand for Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. However, the new government swiftly overturned the ban, allowing him to be elected as an MP and become Prime Minister on March 14, 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## First Decade: Reforms and EU Aspirations

Upon taking office, many skeptics questioned [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan's]] motives, fearing he would pursue an overtly religious agenda and isolate Turkey from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Yet, he initially focused on European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

This commitment led to several key initiatives:
*   **Improved Relations**: Prioritizing better relations with Greece and resolving the division of Cyprus, both obstacles to Turkish EU accession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **EU Accession Talks**: Turkey formally opened talks to join the EU in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | **Societal Liberalization**]]: EU accession drove significant changes, including easing restrictions on religion in public life, such as allowing women to wear headscarves in government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Minority Rights**: Significant new minority rights were introduced, including Kurdish language education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Military Restraint**: Crucially, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] also reined in the military's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

For his first decade in power, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] moved Turkey in a broadly positive direction, seeking to solve the Cyprus issue, introducing domestic political and social reforms, and opening talks with the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Second Decade: Shift Towards Authoritarianism

Despite early successes, [[challenges_and_controversies_during_erdogans_governance | concerns about Erdogan's rule]] began to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Electoral Integrity**: While the AKP won another overwhelming victory in 2007, the 2011 elections were marred by allegations of electoral fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Gezi Park Protests**: A significant turning point occurred in May 2013 when police violently dispersed protesters attempting to block a park development in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This small protest rapidly escalated into nationwide demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. After putting down the unrest, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] clamped down on opposition and became increasingly autocratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Ascension to Presidency**: In 2014, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] ran for and won the presidency, a role typically figurehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He then appointed a compliant prime minister, effectively consolidating his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **2016 Coup Attempt and Crackdown**: On July 15, 2016, elements within the military attempted a coup, which quickly collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. In response, the government launched a massive crackdown, blaming a dissident religious leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Thousands were jailed, and anyone suspected of opposing the AKP was purged from positions in the civil service, military, judiciary, and higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Consolidation of Power**: In 2017, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] introduced constitutional changes, later approved by referendum, which abolished the prime minister post and created an executive presidency, similar to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Domestic and Foreign Policy Shifts

Under [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan's increasingly autocratic rule]], Turkey has become a profoundly illiberal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The media is heavily controlled, human rights abuses are rife, and there are significant concerns about the democratic system and allegations of high-level corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. His rule has been marked by a "growing megalomania," evidenced by the construction of a massive presidential palace in Ankara, legislation making insulting the president a criminal offense, and the decision to rename the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

In foreign policy, [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdogan has moved Turkey further away from the West]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. His authoritarianism has effectively ended hopes for Turkish EU membership, with talks halted for the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Concerns have also grown about Turkey's reliability as a NATO ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. He has sought to make Turkey an international actor by building ties across the Balkans, Africa, and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Additionally, he has formed a "strange relationship" with Vladimir Putin, including purchasing a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile system despite U.S. annoyance, and maintaining an ambivalent stance on Ukraine by continuing trade with Russia while NATO partners imposed sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Legacy and Future

The overall picture is of a Turkey led by an authoritarian leader increasingly cut off from Turkish society and its traditional partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. While [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan's]] early years brought positive reforms and stability, his second decade in power has moved Turkey in a genuinely worrying direction, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Few in the West now regard Turkey as a reliable ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

On May 14, 2023, Turkey will hold presidential and parliamentary elections, which many see as the best chance to unseat [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] and reverse the centralization of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Despite a slump in his poll ratings, partly due to the devastating earthquake in early 2023, the election remains tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. A coalition of six opposition parties aims to unseat him, but divisions within the coalition and other candidates potentially splitting the vote could allow [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] to remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

One thing is certain: [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has utterly [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | transformed Turkey]], initially for the better, and more recently for the worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

On January 11, 2024, hearings commenced at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding South Africa's claim that Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This case has significantly [[impact_of_genocide_accusations_on_international_relations | divided international opinion]], with many states supporting South Africa and the Palestinians, while others, particularly in the West, have dismissed the claim against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Understanding Genocide

Genocide, defined as the willful extermination of a group—men, women, children, young and old—merely for who they are, is considered the gravest crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The UN General Assembly described it as something that "shocks the conscience of mankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The term "genocide" was first coined in the 1940s during the Holocaust, as Nazis pursued the extermination of the Jewish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

In an effort to prevent future mass murders, the UN General Assembly passed the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on December 9, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This Convention, which entered into force three years later, defines genocide as acts intended to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Beyond direct killing, the definition of genocide also includes:
*   Causing serious bodily or mental harm to group members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Deliberately inflicting conditions intended to bring about the group's physical destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Measures to prevent births within the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

The Convention also criminalizes conspiracy, direct and public incitement, attempting, and complicity in genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Article IX of the Convention stipulates that disputes related to it, including a state's responsibility for genocide, should be submitted to the International Court of Justice upon request by any party to the dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## The International Court of Justice (ICJ)

Based in The Hague, Netherlands, the ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected for 9-year terms by the UN General Assembly and Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. As the UN's principal legal body, the ICJ serves two main purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>:
1.  **Advisory Opinions:** Provides legal advice to the UN at the request of bodies like the General Assembly, Security Council, UN Secretariat, and specialized agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
2.  **Contentious Cases:** Rules on issues brought by UN member states that accept its jurisdiction, often focusing on border disputes or acts of aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Crucially, it can also hear cases involving the Genocide Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Any of the 153 states that have ratified the Genocide Convention can bring a case, regardless of direct involvement or special interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Current examples include Ukraine against Russia and The Gambia against Myanmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Past cases have involved Serbia and Croatia, and Bosnia and Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It is important to note that the ICJ is not a criminal court; it solely addresses states' responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Accountability for individuals lies with national courts, special international courts, or the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Background to the Case

[[international_legal_proceedings_from_the_conflict | The roots of South Africa's case]] stem from the conflict that erupted in late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths and thousands wounded, and hundreds taken prisoner, Israeli forces launched a significant air operation against Gaza, followed by a ground invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

It is estimated that this has led to the deaths of at least 23,000 Palestinians, including over 7,000 children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Additionally, almost 2 million people have been displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A total blockade on Gaza has caused severe shortages of food and medical supplies, and disruptions to electricity, water, and communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The UN Secretary-General has described the situation in Gaza as a "humanitarian catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This has led to growing claims that Israel's actions exceed legitimate self-defense and constitute a deliberate policy to destroy the Palestinian people in the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## South Africa's Allegations

South Africa's case builds on its long-standing support for the Palestinians, rooted in the historical links between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and South Africa's ruling African National Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. On December 29, 2023, South Africa initiated proceedings against Israel under the Genocide Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

South Africa specifically requested the Court to consider provisional measures—immediate steps to halt actions that may amount to genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It argued that the actions of the Israeli government and military are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial, and ethnical group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### International Reactions

While many countries have supported South Africa's case, others have opposed the allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The United States, a key Israeli supporter, stated it had not seen any evidence of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Other Western states have also argued that while Israel should exercise restraint, its actions do not amount to a deliberate policy of extermination against Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Some observers contend that the case is primarily about politics rather than law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## The Hearings

On January 11, South Africa opened the proceedings by outlining its allegations, highlighting that Israel's military operations had led to the deaths of approximately 1% of Gaza's Palestinian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. It argued that the operation's complete disregard for civilian life amounted to a deliberate policy of extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. South Africa also claimed that repeated statements by Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and media figures, constituted incitement to genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. It concluded that Israel had shown a "chilling and incontrovertible intent to commit genocide in Gaza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

The next day, Israel responded, categorically rejecting the accusations of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. [[israels_defense_and_international_reactions | Israel's Defense and International Reactions]] called South Africa's claims a "profoundly distorted view of the situation," asserting its invasion of Gaza was a legitimate act of self-defense following Hamas's October attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. It denied accusations of incitement, stating comments were taken out of context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Israel further insisted that Hamas caused many deaths and injuries by using civilian buildings like hospitals and schools for military purposes, and by laying mines and booby traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The Israeli legal team argued that Hamas, with its ideology of destroying Israel and the Jewish people, was the party guilty of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## What Happens Next

Following the oral arguments, the focus shifts to two distinct parts of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>:

1.  **Provisional Measures:** The Court will decide if Israeli actions may contravene the Convention and, if so, may issue an order outlining steps Israel must take to prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Given the urgency, this ruling is expected within a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
2.  **Main Ruling:** The decision on whether Israel has violated the Genocide Convention is not expected anytime soon, potentially taking several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Potential Consequences of a Ruling Against Israel

The ICJ lacks enforcement powers and cannot compel a state to abide by its rulings, though it holds significant moral authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. A ruling against Israel could, however, lead to further action at the United Nations, including resolutions in the Security Council or General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

It is generally believed that the Israeli government is likely to ignore any provisional measures that limit its operations in Gaza, arguing a duty to its citizens to continue its campaign until its goals are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated on the 100th day of the operation that the campaign would continue until "total victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Legal analysts suggest that a provisional measures order could offer early indications of the Court's direction on the central question of Israel's alleged violation of the Genocide Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

For the main ruling, potentially years away, Israel appears to be preparing its defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Netanyahu, has openly questioned the Court's credibility, citing the origins of many justices from countries with less free judiciaries and potential political biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This suggests Israel may reject an adverse ruling by claiming it is politically motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Nevertheless, if the Court decides that Israel has violated the Convention, it would suffer immense damage to its international reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The implications for a country forged by the Holocaust would be profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

A ruling against Israel, whether on provisional measures or the central allegations, would also present a significant challenge for countries that support Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. They would face a dilemma: condemn Israel and support measures against it, or reject the Court's decision as politically motivated, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the ICJ—the world's highest court and principal legal organ of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This could mark another dangerous step away from the established international order that has underpinned the global system for the last 80 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

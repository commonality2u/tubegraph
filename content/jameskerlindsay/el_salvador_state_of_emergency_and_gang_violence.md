Following a sudden spate of killings, El Salvador declared a state of emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This declaration led to the arrest of 17,000 people and the implementation of numerous tough new measures to address the long-standing issue of gang violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This development is a concerning setback for a nation that was moving away from its reputation as the world's murder capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It also raises serious questions about the direction of the country under its young president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## El Salvador: A Nation Blighted by Organized Crime

While many might associate dangerous countries with war zones like Ukraine, Yemen, or Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, many of the world's deadliest nations are, in fact, plagued by organized crime and gang violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. El Salvador serves as a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In 2015, it recorded the second-highest violent death rate globally, with 126 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, surpassed only by Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Although the situation had appeared to improve in recent years, this trend was halted by a sudden surge in violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

In March 2022, 60 people were killed in El Salvador over a single weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In response, the government initiated another crackdown on gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Beyond the state of emergency and mass arrests, new stringent measures were introduced, including lowering the age of criminal responsibility, imposing longer prison sentences, and even restricting press reporting on gang-related crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While many view these actions as necessary to combat gang violence, they have also fueled concerns that the country is drifting towards authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Geographical and Economic Overview

The Republic of El Salvador is situated in Central America, with its southern coastline bordering the Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It shares borders with Guatemala to its northwest and Honduras to its north and east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Covering 21,000 square kilometers (8,100 square miles), it ranks as the 148th largest among the 193 UN member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Its population is approximately 6.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In 2020, El Salvador's per capita GDP was US$3,800, categorizing it as a lower middle-income country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_gang_violence_in_el_salvador | Historical Context of Violence]]

El Salvador boasts a long and rich history, with human settlement believed to date back at least 1500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Spanish Conquest and Independence
In the early 16th century, Spain conquered El Salvador, integrating it into the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which was part of the Vice-Royalty of New Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. As Spanish imperial rule crumbled in the early 19th century, El Salvador was forcibly incorporated into Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. However, in 1823, it joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua to form the Federal Republic of Central America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This union began to collapse by the end of the 1830s, and El Salvador officially declared independence in 1841 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Although it briefly reunited with Honduras and Guatemala in 1896 to form the Greater Republic of Central America, this entity disintegrated two years later, leaving El Salvador as a fully independent state once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### The Civil War (1979-1992)
Long plagued by political instability, a civilian government was overthrown by a coup in 1931, ushering in what would become 50 years of military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. By the late 1970s, opposition to the regime intensified with protests and strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. On October 15, 1979, the country's president was overthrown and exiled by hard-line military officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Fearing an impending Marxist revolution, the new regime launched a brutal crackdown on dissent, plunging the country into civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. U.S.-backed government forces, supported by paramilitary death squads, fought against the FMLN, an umbrella group of various left-wing organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The 13-year conflict was characterized by extreme brutality, including widespread human rights abuses such as state-sanctioned murder, torture, kidnappings, and disappearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The civil war concluded in January 1992 with a UN-brokered peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This agreement led to the military's withdrawal from politics and the legal recognition of the FMLN as a political party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. An estimated 80,000 lives were lost, and over a million people were displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Rise of Gangs
Hopes for recovery and rebuilding were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Beyond natural disasters, El Salvador faced a new, deadly challenge: gang violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Many Salvadorians had fled to the United States during the war, forming a large community around Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. There, they became involved in the city's burgeoning gang culture, leading to the formation of two major gangs: MS-13 and Barrio 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Crucially, as long as the civil war persisted in El Salvador, the growing gang violence was confined to the United States, as convicted gang members could not be deported to their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, once the conflict ended, the United States began expelling these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. As they returned, they brought their gang affiliations with them, causing the situation to escalate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. By the turn of the millennium, El Salvador's gang problem was spiraling out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Despite successive governments adopting "zero-tolerance" approaches, efforts to crack down on gangs proved largely ineffective, and the situation steadily worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. In addition to internal conflicts, gangs—now estimated to have between 60,000 and 70,000 members—began targeting the police and security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### The 2012 Gang Truce
In a surprising turn of events, rival gangs reached a truce in March 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Brokered by a former FMLN commander and a Catholic bishop, and tacitly endorsed by the government, the deal designated certain public areas, such as schools, as off-limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Attacks against security forces also decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In exchange, steps were taken to reform the harsh prison system, where gang members often faced terrible conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Initially, the truce appeared successful, leading to a rapid and significant drop in the violent death rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Within a year, the number of murders declined by 40 percent, from approximately 70 per 100,000 people to around 40 per 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. However, the truce became increasingly unpopular among large segments of society, as well as within the police and security forces, who felt it granted gangs too much power and allowed them to regroup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The truce was ultimately short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the appointment of the justice minister, who had been instrumental in the process, was illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. A new president took office in June 2014, refusing to recognize the truce and insisting on developing his own strategy for tackling the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Consequently, the situation sharply deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. By 2015, the murder rate surged again, surpassing many of the world's worst conflict zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## [[impact_of_gang_violence_on_el_salvadors_international_relations | International Repercussions of Violence]]

The escalating killings had significant wider international effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Thousands of Salvadorians fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. By 2016, Salvadorians constituted the second-largest group of unauthorized migrants entering the United States and the largest single nationality legally granted asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Importantly, images of refugees from El Salvador—along with those fleeing violence in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras, which also faced severe gang problems—contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment that helped Donald Trump win the US presidential race in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | Nayib Bukele's Approach]]

The situation began to improve with the election of [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | Nayib Bukele]] as president in May 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Having pledged to address the country's gang violence, he quickly introduced a range of tough new measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. These included major targeted crackdowns in key gang strongholds and significant increases in police and military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Simultaneously, the government initiated social programs in the most impoverished areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Most controversially, reports emerged that government representatives had met with jailed gang leaders, allegedly offering them special privileges in exchange for reduced violence—a claim later denied by [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | Bukele]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Regardless, the government's efforts appeared effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. By the end of 2020, the situation had dramatically improved, with the number of murders dropping to just over 1,300—a significant decrease from the 6,500 recorded a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. On January 27, 2021, President [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | Bukele]] announced that El Salvador had gone a full 48 hours without a gun death for the first time in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Despite a three-day outbreak of violence in November 2021 that resulted in 40 deaths, the year concluded with 1,140 deaths, indicating continued improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## The Latest Crisis (March 2022) and [[controversial_measures_and_human_rights_concerns_in_el_salvador | Human Rights Concerns]]

It was against this backdrop of apparent improvement that the latest surge of violence erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. On Saturday, March 26, 2022, 62 people were killed in a single day—the highest daily death toll since the end of the civil war 30 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. While the exact cause of this latest bout of killings remains unclear, the government responded swiftly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

In addition to imposing the state of emergency, which has since been extended, police began rounding up thousands of suspected gang members, even publicizing images of leading detainees on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Furthermore, the country has introduced numerous new measures, many of which have been condemned by leading international human rights organizations, including the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Perhaps the most contentious measure is a law criminalizing reporting on gang activities that could "generate panic and anxiety amongst the general population," an offense punishable by up to 15 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This legislation has drawn particularly heavy criticism not only from human rights organizations but also from the US State Department, which insists that "journalists must have the freedom to do their jobs without fear of violence threats or unjust attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

These steps are especially controversial given growing concerns about El Salvador's broader trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. While President [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | Bukele]] has maintained high approval ratings, often exceeding 85 percent, there are increasing fears about his authoritarian tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. In September 2021, the United States even sanctioned five Supreme Court judges appointed to rule in favor of a second presidential term for [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | Bukele]], which contravenes a constitutional time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

El Salvador appears to be at a critical juncture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. For almost three decades, it has battled gang violence, which made it one of the world's most dangerous countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. While significant progress seemed to be made in the past three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, there is now a perceived risk that the charismatic young president might be using the issue of gang violence to consolidate his control over the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

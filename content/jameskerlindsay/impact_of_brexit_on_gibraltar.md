[[Britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's decision to leave the European Union]] significantly altered the long-standing situation regarding Gibraltar, creating new challenges and reopening old debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. After several years of [[negotiations_and_agreements_concerning_gibraltar | negotiations]], the sides are reportedly on the brink of a deal to address problems stemming from [[Britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Brexit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Brexit's Impact

In June 2016, Britain held a referendum on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. While Gibraltar overwhelmingly voted to remain in the European Union, understanding the complications of leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, Britain narrowly voted to depart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This decision affected Gibraltar particularly heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

As [[negotiations_and_agreements_concerning_gibraltar | negotiations]] began on the terms of Brexit, separate discussions became necessary to manage complex issues arising for Gibraltar, Northern Ireland, and the British Sovereign Bases in Cyprus, all of which retained a land border with the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

The primary issues that arose included:
*   **Freedom of Movement and Border Checks**: Within the EU, the frontier was open for people, goods, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. With the UK and Gibraltar outside the EU, this needed to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Approximately 15,000 people cross the border daily, many for work, making the introduction of full border checks hugely disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **[[Economic_impact_of_Brexit | Economic]], Trade, Financial, and Legal Problems**: Brexit also created a range of these issues for Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Post-Brexit Negotiations

On December 31, 2020, just a month before Brexit, Britain and Spain reached an initial framework agreement for Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This agreement stipulated that any full accord would consider Gibraltar's geographical situation, international legal status, special circumstances, and its relationship with Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

However, while this established a broad framework, settling the exact details has proven extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Despite the EU authorizing [[negotiations_and_agreements_concerning_gibraltar | negotiations]] in July 2021, progress has been slow, and a final agreement has yet to be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. A final deal will be one of the first significant foreign policy tasks for the new Labour government, which took power in Britain on July 5, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## The Unresolved Core Dispute

While a deal over Gibraltar will help the day-to-day situation on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, it will not resolve the fundamental point of difference between Britain and Spain: the 300-year-old dispute over sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

*   **UK's Stance**: The UK roots its position in the principle of self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The British Government insists that any change in Gibraltar's status must be approved by its residents, who continue to show a desire to remain under British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Spain's Stance**: Spain maintains its claim to sovereignty, arguing a historical right to "The Rock," which it contends was unfairly seized in the early 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. While the Spanish Government has expressed willingness to accept some form of joint sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, Gibraltarians continue to reject this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Ultimately, reconciling these positions remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Following [[Britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's decision to leave the European Union]], which exacerbated previously managed problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, the current goal is to minimize points of friction for Gibraltarians, London, and Madrid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Disputes, in this sense, are sometimes perpetually managed rather than settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

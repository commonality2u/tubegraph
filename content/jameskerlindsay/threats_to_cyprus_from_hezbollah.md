The island of Cyprus, the European Union's most easterly member, has recently faced threats of attack from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This development stems from the growing risk of a new conflict on the Lebanese-Israeli border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, which could again see the island at the centre of humanitarian aid efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Cyprus's Geopolitical Complexities

[[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] is situated at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its closest neighbours include Turkey (65 km to the north) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, Syria (100 km to the east) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, Lebanon and Israel (to its southeast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, and Egypt (to its south) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Its nearest EU neighbour, Greece, is 400 km to the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The island has an exceptionally rich history, straddling Europe and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, and has been ruled by various major civilizations controlling the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, the island has been divided, with roughly 36% beyond the effective control of the internationally recognised government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Additionally, Britain maintains two military bases on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Evolution of Cyprus's Foreign Policy

### Early Independence and Non-Alignment
Following its independence in 1960, the Republic of Cyprus, under President Archbishop Makarios, became part of the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This movement rejected confrontation between the West and the Soviet bloc during the Cold War and included many leading Arab states such as Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. As a result, Cyprus quickly forged close ties with its Middle Eastern neighbours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The [[Cyprus Dispute and its Impact | breakdown of the constitution in 1963]] and the subsequent Turkish invasion in 1974 cemented Cyprus's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Anti-Western sentiment grew among many Greek Cypriots, strengthening the country's ties to the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Cyprus viewed its Arab neighbours as a valuable voting bloc at the United Nations, especially given their distrust of Turkey, which had strong ties to the West and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

For decades, [[Cyprus relations with Israel and the Middle East | Cyprus's relations with the Arab Middle East]] steadily strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The island became a sanctuary during the Lebanese civil war in the 1980s and an important business base for the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Meanwhile, its relationship with Israel remained poor, partly due to the Cypriot government's desire to avoid antagonizing Arab neighbours and strong pro-Palestinian sentiment among Greek Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Israel, conversely, prioritized its alliance with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Shift with EU Membership and Ties to Israel
When Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, it was expected to shift its focus away from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Although Cyprus left the Non-Aligned Movement as an EU condition, its isolation from the Middle East proved impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

This was clearly demonstrated in 2006 during the war in southern Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, when Cyprus became the centre of a massive international evacuation effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This event cemented the island's value as a hub for EU humanitarian and crisis management in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This role has again come to the fore with the war in Gaza, with Cyprus leading efforts to provide aid through the Cyprus Maritime Corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

[[Cyprus relations with Israel and the Middle East | Relations between Cyprus and Israel]] improved dramatically after 2010, following the deterioration of Turkey-Israel ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The discovery of natural gas deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean led to a maritime boundary agreement between Cyprus and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. As Cyprus moved in a more pro-Western direction, high-level contacts and bilateral agreements across various areas quickly grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Crucially, military cooperation also began to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Military Cooperation with Israel
A key highlight of this enhanced military cooperation was in May 2023, when the Cyprus National Guard and Israeli Defense Forces staged major joint exercises on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. These exercises were widely understood to simulate a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. They also provided an opportunity for Israeli warplanes to operate from an unfamiliar airbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Hezbollah's Warning
Against this backdrop of increased military cooperation, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, issued a warning on June 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He stated that if Cyprus allowed Israel to use its airports or bases to attack Lebanon, it would be considered "a part of the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Many observers interpreted this to mean the possibility of Hezbollah missile or drone attacks against the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Reactions and Interpretations
### Cypriot and EU Response
The comments prompted a strong reaction from the Cypriot government and its EU partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides insisted that Cyprus "was not involved in planning for military conflicts in any way whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. EU leaders issued a statement condemning threats against a fellow member and underscoring their solidarity with Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. European officials insisted that "any attack against Cyprus would be an attack against the rest of the Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. It is also believed that the EU would have made it clear to Iran, Hezbollah's patron, that a strike against Cyprus would carry very serious consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Diffusing Tensions and Alternative Targets
Cyprus also appears to be trying to diffuse the threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The EU statement did not specifically name Hezbollah, a move Cypriot officials insist was deliberately designed not to escalate tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

In an interesting development, the Cypriot government has suggested that Nasrallah's comments were not aimed against the Republic of Cyprus but rather at the British military bases on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. These bases have long been key to Western military operations in the Middle East, including recent strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. However, given the recent joint military exercises between Cypriot and Israeli forces, it would nevertheless appear that Cyprus was in fact the primary target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## Implications for Cyprus's Foreign Policy
The situation raises questions about whether Cyprus's close ties to Israel are becoming problematic, not only by making it a target for Hezbollah but also potentially disrupting its ability to play a humanitarian role in the wider Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

The Cypriot government would argue there is no contradiction between its strong relations with Israel and its humanitarian role, suggesting that such ties can even help its humanitarian efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Nicosia also maintains very close ties with many Arab countries, including Egypt and Gulf Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Furthermore, Cyprus is still seen by many across the region as a safe and welcoming neutral territory, evidenced by Israelis and Lebanese buying property on the island as a "bolt hole" from regional uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Nevertheless, recent events have highlighted the foreign policy complexities facing countries on geopolitical fault lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. While Cyprus is a valuable part of EU humanitarian efforts, its close bilateral relationship with Israel now seemingly puts the country at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This may prompt questions about the direction of Cyprus's foreign policy and whether some recalibration is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Ultimately, these developments underscore the degree to which Cyprus has now made the EU a frontline actor in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Eritrea, located in Northeast Africa, is one of the world's most enduring and brutal dictatorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. For over three decades, Isaias Afwerki has ruled the country with an iron grip and absolute authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, turning it into one of the most secretive and authoritarian countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It has often been referred to as "Africa's North Korea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Regime

After [[Eritreas history and colonial past | Eritrea]] gained independence in 1993, there were initial hopes for a modern democracy, especially with a draft constitution in 1997 enshrining democracy and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, this quickly deteriorated:
*   **Centralized Power** Isaias Afwerki, who became president, began tightening his grip on power after the 1998 border conflict with [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Totalitarian Control** Under Afwerki's rule, Eritrea has become a totalitarian one-man dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The ruling party is the People's Front for Democracy and Justice, the successor of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Lack of Democratic Institutions** The country operates without a legislature, an independent judiciary, or press freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The 1997 draft constitution was never endorsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## [[Human rights abuses and repression in Eritrea | Human Rights Abuses and Repression]]

The regime has a severe record of [[human_rights_abuses_and_repression_in_eritrea | human rights abuses]]:
*   **Suppression of Dissent** Dissent is crushed, often through imprisonment, torture, or even execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Crackdowns** A large-scale crackdown in 2001 resulted in almost all opposition leaders being jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Independent media has been shut down, and elections indefinitely postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Forced Military Service** The regime enforces a conscription system that forces men and women into military service without a clearly defined end term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Liberties** Fundamental human rights have been wholly curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Mass Exodus** These harsh domestic conditions have led hundreds of thousands of Eritreans to flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## [[Eritreas international relations and foreign policy | Foreign Policy and Isolation]]

Eritrea has maintained near-total isolation from much of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, and Afwerki has faced considerable international criticism for his foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Engagement in Regional Conflicts** In 2018, after a peace agreement with [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali]], Eritrea sent troops to fight alongside Ethiopian forces in the Tigray civil war, leading to allegations of large-scale war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Eritrea has also been accused of arming insurgents in neighboring Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Strategic Alliances** While largely closed off from the West, Eritrea maintains close contacts with India, a key trading partner and development assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Amid renewed tensions with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]], Eritrea has also built ties with Somalia and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Eritrea is also one of Russia's few reliable allies on the world stage, frequently voting with Moscow at the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## [[Opposition movements against Eritreas dictatorship | Opposition and Future Outlook]]

Despite the terrible situation, Afwerki has faced little organized opposition internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Exiled activists and journalists who expose [[human_rights_abuses_and_repression_in_eritrea | human rights abuses]] face significant personal risk, including intimidation, surveillance, and threats against their families back home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

However, signs of growing opposition are now emerging:
*   **Diaspora Activism** An increasing number of escapees and dissidents are speaking out against Afwerki's rule, detailing forced labor, arbitrary detention, and torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Younger, second-generation Eritreans living abroad are becoming more active, leading to bolder opposition groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Public Demonstrations** Eritrean Independence Days are now used to demonstrate against the regime in Western capitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Organized Groups** Groups like Brigade Nhamedu (Blue Revolution) are reaching out to diaspora communities to spread awareness about [[human_rights_abuses_and_repression_in_eritrea | human rights abuses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Ethiopian Involvement** [[Ethiopian political history and conflicts | Ethiopia]] appears to be more involved as tensions between the two countries rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Two opposition groups, including Blue Revolution, openly met in Addis Ababa in early 2025 to discuss overthrowing the Afwerki regime, an act that implies tacit Ethiopian acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. While the possibility of Ethiopia sponsoring an armed insurgency or even invading Eritrea for regime change cannot be wholly discounted, both options seem unlikely due to [[Eritrea]]'s fortifications and the inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

### The Age Factor
A critical factor for the future of the regime is Afwerki's age; at almost 80, questions about his successor are growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. If he were to die in office, the regime's future is uncertain, potentially leading to internal power struggles or civil unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. However, Afwerki remains fit and active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, and there is little evidence to suggest the regime is under serious internal threat at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Removing Africa's most repressive dictator remains a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

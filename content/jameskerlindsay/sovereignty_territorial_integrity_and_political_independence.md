These three interlinked concepts underpin modern international politics and are crucial for understanding conflicts and [[international_relations_and_state_borders | statehood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Russia's invasion of Ukraine represents an unprecedented challenge to all three, going beyond other major conflicts of modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Sovereignty

Sovereignty is the universally understood right of countries to determine what happens within their borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. It emerged as a fundamental principle in the mid-17th century and underpins the modern understanding of statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

The principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other states remains the foundation of the modern international order, despite some challenges, such as the concept of the responsibility to protect (R2P) when states systematically violate human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This principle is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Violations of Sovereignty

All invasions by one state or a group of states against another inherently violate a country's sovereignty, regardless of intent or justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
*   Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
*   Serbia (Yugoslavia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
*   Kuwait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
*   Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
*   Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
*   Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>

The use of terms like "peace interventions" or "special operations" are sanitized descriptions for invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Territorial Integrity

Territorial integrity is another fundamental principle of the international system, also enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. For discussion of conflict, it means that states have a responsibility to respect one another's defined physical boundaries, whether land borders or maritime limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Respect for Territorial Integrity

Generally, the principle of territorial integrity has been respected in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Wars of territorial conquest are rare, and formal annexation of conquered territory has been largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

Examples where territorial integrity was preserved despite invasion include:
*   The US-led invasions of Iraq (2003) and Afghanistan (2001) did not result in any border changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Efforts by Iraqi Kurds to proclaim independence were strongly opposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

### Violations of Territorial Integrity

While less common, violations of territorial integrity do occur:
*   The NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia (1999) eventually led to [[legal_and_political_arguments_regarding_kosovos_independence | Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This outcome violated Serbia's territorial integrity, even if those recognizing Kosovo argued for extenuating circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. However, the goal was not annexation by any protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, nor did any other country directly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. A condition for Kosovo's independence was that it would not unite with neighboring Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity is clear-cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, despite having recognized the change in its status when Ukraine became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Russia also recognized the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk just before the 2022 invasion, with the expectation that these areas would be incorporated into the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Political Independence

Political independence, explicitly stated in the UN Charter, has several readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

### State Extinction

Most obviously, it can mean the existence of a state as a sovereign entity in the international system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Invasions aimed at the formal extinction of a state are rare in modern times, as international law no longer accepts conquest as a legitimate basis for state extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   The best modern example of an attempt to wipe out a sovereign state was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   Major Western interventions did not result in state extinction; Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yugoslavia (later Serbia) continue to exist as UN member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

### Control over Internal Decisions

Political independence also refers to the extent to which a state controls decisions made within its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This is critical because many invasions target regime change, which challenges a state's political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   The US and its partners' invasions of Afghanistan (to remove the Taliban) and Iraq (to remove Saddam Hussein) violated both countries' political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.
*   In contrast, regime change was not NATO's goal in the case of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

### Russia's Challenge to Ukraine's Independence

Russia has suggested that the very existence of an independent Ukrainian state is at stake, with President Putin stating he regards Russians and Ukrainians as one people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Putin has openly stated that Ukraine's future as an independent state is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Regime change is also on Russia's agenda, with Putin justifying the war as a need to "demilitarize and de-Nazify" Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. It is expected that Moscow might install a puppet regime or draw Ukraine into a confederal arrangement with Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## Unprecedented Challenge to International Order

Russia's actions in Ukraine are distinct from other major conflicts of modern times because they violate all three fundamental principles of modern [[international_relations_and_state_borders | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   While all invasions violate sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
*   The US-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan challenged independence but not territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   The NATO action against Serbia resulted in a violation of territorial integrity ([[legal_and_political_arguments_regarding_kosovos_independence | Kosovo]]) but did not challenge Serbia's political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   In contrast, Russia has violated Ukraine's sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and is set on abolishing its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

This represents a fundamental challenge to the established international order since the end of the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. It is a challenge to the fundamental rules of the international system, established over 70 years ago, that define the limits of states' behavior towards one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Russia's actions, coupled with its status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and threats of nuclear retaliation, indicate a disregard for the basic principles and norms of [[international_relations_and_state_borders | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

This invasion has the potential to fundamentally affect the world, marking a break with the global political system built over the past 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. While the system may be flawed, it has been an improvement over the "might makes right" approach to international affairs, which may now be returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

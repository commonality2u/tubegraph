Cyprus, the European Union's most easterly member, finds itself at a complex geopolitical crossroads, positioned across distinct regions and navigating between competing actors and demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While it has become a vital element of broader humanitarian operations in the Middle East, its foreign policy has also put it under threat of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This article examines the implications of Cyprus's EU membership on its regional political standing and relations.

## Cyprus's Geopolitical Landscape

The Republic of Cyprus is situated at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its closest neighbors include Turkey to its north, Syria to its east, Lebanon and Israel to its southeast, and Egypt to its south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Its nearest EU neighbor, Greece, is 400 km to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The island has an exceptionally rich [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | history]] straddling Europe and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Over millennia, it fell under the rule of various major civilizations, including the Egyptians, Romans, Byzantines, and Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, the island has been divided, with roughly 36% beyond the effective control of the internationally recognized government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Britain also retains two military bases on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Pre-EU Foreign Policy: Non-Alignment and Arab Ties

Upon gaining independence in 1960, Cyprus, under its first president Archbishop Makarios, joined the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This movement included many leading Arab states such as Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. As a result, the new Cypriot state began to forge close ties with its Middle Eastern neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The defining factor shaping Cyprus's broader regional relations was the breakdown of its constitution in 1963 and the subsequent 1974 Turkish invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Many Greek Cypriots blamed NATO and the United States for failing to stop Turkey, which led to increased anti-Western sentiment and strengthened the country's ties to the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Cyprus increasingly viewed its Arab neighbors as a valuable voting bloc at the United Nations, especially given their distrust of Turkey, which had strong ties with the West and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Over the following decades, [[cyprus_relations_with_israel_and_the_middle_east | Cyprus's relations with the Arab Middle East]] steadily strengthened, with the island becoming a sanctuary for those fleeing conflicts and an important base for businesses in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Conversely, [[cyprus_relations_with_israel_and_the_middle_east | Cyprus's relationship with Israel remained poor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The Cypriot government sought to avoid antagonizing its Arab neighbors, and many Greek Cypriots were fiercely pro-Palestinian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Israel, in turn, prioritized its alliance with Turkey over relations with Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## EU Membership and Regional Engagement

When Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, many expected it to shift its focus away from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. As a condition of EU membership, Cyprus had to leave the Non-Aligned Movement and gained the backing of over two dozen European partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

However, any notion that Cyprus could isolate itself from the Middle East was quickly disproven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The 2006 war in southern Lebanon, involving Israel and Hezbollah, saw Cyprus become the center of a massive international evacuation effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This event cemented the island's value as a hub for EU humanitarian and crisis management in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

This role has again come to the fore with the current war in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Working with the EU, the US, and other partners, the Cypriot government established the Cyprus Maritime Corridor, providing vital assistance to nearly 2 million people affected by the fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. As tensions grow again between Israel and Hezbollah, Cyprus is preparing to handle potential new conflicts in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Shifting Alliances: Cyprus, Israel, and Turkey

A significant development impacting Cyprus's regional stance was the dramatic improvement in its relations with Israel after 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This coincided with a deterioration of ties between Turkey and Israel, especially after a 2010 Israeli raid on a Turkish aid ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The discovery of natural gas deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean also spurred cooperation, leading to a maritime boundary agreement between Cyprus and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

As Israel was no longer tied to Ankara, and with Cyprus moving in a more pro-Western direction under a new president, high-level contacts and bilateral agreements quickly grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Crucially, they also began to build military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This was highlighted in May 2023 when the Cyprus National Guard and Israeli Defense Forces staged major joint exercises on the island, understood to simulate a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Hezbollah Threats and the EU's Response

Against this backdrop, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned on June 19th that if Cyprus allowed Israel to use its airports or bases for attacks on Lebanon, it would be considered "a part of the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This was widely interpreted as a threat of Hezbollah missile or drone attacks against the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

The Cypriot government and its EU partners reacted strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

> "Cyprus was not involved in planning for military conflicts in any way whatsoever." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
> â€” Nikos Christodoulides, Cypriot President

EU leaders issued a statement condemning threats against a fellow member and underscoring their solidarity with Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. European officials insisted that "any attack against Cyprus would be an attack against the rest of the Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. It is believed the EU made it clear to Iran, Hezbollah's patron, that a strike against Cyprus would carry "very serious consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Cyprus has also attempted to diffuse the threats, maintaining its own contacts with Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Cypriot officials noted that the EU statement did not specifically name Hezbollah, a move deliberately designed not to escalate tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The Cypriot government has even suggested that Nasrallah's comments might have been directed at the British military bases on the island, which have long been key to Western military operations in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. However, given the recent military exercises between Cypriot and Israeli forces, it appears Cyprus was likely the primary target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Balancing Act: A Humanitarian Hub with Strategic Ties

The question arises whether Cyprus's close ties to Israel are becoming a problem, potentially disrupting its ability to play a humanitarian role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The Cypriot government argues there is no contradiction, asserting that good working relations with Israel do not hinder its humanitarian hub role, and in fact, strong ties to the Israeli government can even be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

Nicosia also highlights that despite improved relations with Israel, it maintains very close ties with many Arab countries, including neighboring Egypt and increasingly the Gulf Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The official visit of the Emir of Qatar to Cyprus in May further exemplified this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

Furthermore, Cyprus is still widely perceived across the region as a safe and welcoming neutral territory, attracting Israelis and Lebanese, among others, to buy property on the island as a "bolt hole" from regional uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Nevertheless, recent events underscore the foreign policy complexities faced by countries on geopolitical fault lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. While Cyprus is a valuable part of EU humanitarian efforts, its close bilateral relationship with Israel now seemingly puts the country at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This raises questions about the direction of Cyprus's foreign policy and whether a recalibration is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. In the meantime, these developments highlight how Cyprus's EU membership has made the EU a frontline actor in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

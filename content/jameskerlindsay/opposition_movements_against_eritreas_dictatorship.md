For over three decades, [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]] has governed Eritrea with an iron grip, transforming it into one of the most secretive and authoritarian nations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His regime has suppressed dissent, compelled citizens into indefinite military service, and maintained the country in near-total isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Despite years of brutal crackdowns, dissidents are now regrouping in an effort to challenge his rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Eritrea is recognized as one of the world's longest-standing and most brutal dictatorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, frequently referred to as "Africaâ€™s North Korea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Nature of the Dictatorship

After gaining independence in 1993, there were initial hopes for Eritrea to become a modern democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]], who became president, soon tightened his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This shift intensified after a border dispute with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] in 1998, which led to a two-year war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The ongoing tensions kept Eritrea highly militarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Measures implemented by [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] to consolidate power included:
*   **Suppression of Media and Elections** Independent media was shut down, and elections were indefinitely postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Crackdown on Opposition** A major crackdown in 2001 resulted in the imprisonment of almost all opposition leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Totalitarian Rule** Under [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]]'s rule, Eritrea has become one of the most repressive countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The People's Front for Democracy and Justice (successor of the EPLF) operates as a totalitarian one-man dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Lack of Fundamental Rights** The country lacks a legislature, an independent judiciary, and press freedom, severely curtailing [[human_rights_abuses_and_repression_in_eritrea | fundamental human rights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Indefinite Conscription** The regime enforces a conscription system that forces men and women into military service without a clear end term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. These harsh conditions have driven hundreds of thousands of Eritreans to flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

[[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] has also faced international criticism for his foreign policy, including allegations of large-scale war crimes during the Tigray civil war in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Growing Opposition

Despite the dire situation, organized opposition against [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]]'s rule has historically been limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Internally, his grip on power remains tight, and external criticism has been muted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Exiled activists, including journalists and former government officials, operate at considerable personal risk, as the Eritrean government targets critics abroad with intimidation, surveillance, and threats against their families back home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

However, there are now signs that opposition is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>:
*   **Increased Dissident Voices** A growing number of escapees and dissidents are speaking out against [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]]'s brutal rule, sharing harrowing accounts of forced labor, arbitrary detention, and torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Youth Activism** Younger, second-generation Eritreans living abroad are becoming more active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Bolder Opposition Groups** Opposition groups are becoming bolder, using Eritrean independence days as opportunities to demonstrate against the regime in Western capitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Organized Efforts** Eritrean organizations are operating more openly. For example, Brigade Nhamedu, also known as Blue Revolution, is actively engaging with diaspora communities to raise awareness about [[human_rights_abuses_and_repression_in_eritrea | human rights abuses]] and counter regime intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Ethiopia's Involvement

Crucially, as tensions between [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] and Eritrea rise again, [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] appears to be more involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This was evidenced by an open meeting of two opposition groups, including Blue Revolution, in Addis Ababa in early 2025 to discuss overthrowing the [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Such a meeting would not have been possible without tacit [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopian]] acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

The possibility of [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] further [[supporting_dissident_groups_and_the_risks_involved | supporting opposition groups]], sponsoring an armed insurgency, or even invading Eritrea for regime change cannot be entirely discounted, especially given the historical tensions between the two countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. However, both options seem unlikely due to Eritrea's heavy fortifications and the inherent risks of invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Future Prospects

Another critical factor is [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]]'s advancing age; at nearly 80 years old, questions are mounting about the regime's longevity, particularly as he has not groomed a successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. If [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] were to die in office, the regime's future would be uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Some observers predict the military or ruling elite would try to maintain the status quo, while others suggest the country could descend into chaos, internal power struggles, or even civil unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Despite these dynamics, [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] appears to be fit and active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. For now, there is little evidence to suggest that the regime is under serious internal threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. While long-suppressed external movements are gaining momentum, and [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] is becoming more involved, removing [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]] from power remains a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

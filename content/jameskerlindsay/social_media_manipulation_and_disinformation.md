Social media manipulation and disinformation campaigns have emerged as a critical element of modern international relations, representing a potent non-military strategy for states to destabilise their adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These tactics are often blended with traditional military strategies as part of [[influence_of_hybrid_threats_on_conflicts | hybrid warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Electoral Manipulation

One of the most concerning developments in modern international relations is the increasing use of electoral manipulation, frequently involving disinformation campaigns conducted through social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The outcomes of such campaigns can profoundly affect the future of countries, regions, and even the international system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Over the past decade, Russia has been accused of using electoral manipulation against numerous Western states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Allegations include interference in the 2016 US presidential election and the UK's Brexit referendum, as well as in countries like France, Germany, and the Baltic states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Case Study: Romania's 2024 Presidential Election

Claims of Russian meddling emerged in Romania following the first round of its presidential elections on November 24, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In a shock result, CÄƒlin Georgescu, a largely unknown [[rise_of_farright_politics_in_romania | far-right candidate]], secured the most votes (22.95%), ensuring his place in the runoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This outcome was unexpected, as polling had consistently shown his support to be less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Georgescu is known for his extreme views, including praising Romania's pro-Nazi leadership during the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. He is also described as pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and has spoken out against Romania's support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Allegations of Social Media Manipulation

Attention quickly turned to Georgescu's social media activity, particularly on TikTok, where numerous accounts appeared to have amplified his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This led to suspicions of a coordinated effort to manipulate public opinion, with accusations firmly pointed at Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The Kremlin has denied these allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### Responses and Concerns

The outcome of the first round of voting has caused considerable concern both within Romania and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Calls have emerged for an investigation into Georgescu's funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis convened the Supreme Council of Defense to analyze potential national security risks from state and non-state actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

In Brussels, the head of the centrist liberal group at the European Parliament called for TikTok's CEO to address the allegations before European lawmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Neighboring Moldova, which has also faced recent allegations of Russian electoral manipulation, expressed concern. Its pro-European president, Maia Sandu, stated that the two countries cannot let the Kremlin dictate their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

While a recount was conducted due to a technical matter, justices found no evidence of fraud, allowing the second round of elections to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The events in Romania underscore several critical points regarding social media manipulation and disinformation:

*   **Weaponization of Democracy:** If Moscow is indeed implicated, it would again signal Russia's willingness to use electoral manipulation to undermine the West, effectively weaponizing democracy against itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Need for Robust Defenses:** These events highlight the urgency of strengthening [[cyber_warfare_and_international_security | cyber defenses]], combating online disinformation, and ensuring the integrity of democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Power of Social Media:** The situation underscores the power of social media to shape political processes, often in unexpected and disruptive ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Mainstreaming of Far-Right Views:** Regardless of foreign interference, the vote also highlights that [[rise_of_farright_politics_in_romania | far-right views]] have become more mainstream and resonate with worrying large parts of society, raising crucial questions about the future of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

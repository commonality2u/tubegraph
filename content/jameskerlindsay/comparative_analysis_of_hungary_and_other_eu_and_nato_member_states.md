In recent years, [[impact_of_hungary_on_european_union_dynamics | Hungary's direction]] under its leader, Viktor Orban, has caused growing concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Beyond attacking democratic freedoms domestically, Orban has been [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | undermining Western solidarity over Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Many believe his actions challenging Western positions are actively serving [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | Russia's interests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Multilateralism and Shared Values

The modern world order is built on multilateralism, with a significant increase in international organizations since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While most organizations have clear joining rules, few define mechanisms for expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Some bodies, like the United Nations, serve as discussion forums for countries with diverse worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, others, such as NATO and the European Union, expect members to adhere to shared values, specifically a fundamental respect for liberal democracy principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The question of what happens when a member abandons these values has become crucial within the [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | European Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Poland]] has been a "troublesome partner" for the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, and Turkey has long posed problems for NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, [[impact_of_hungary_on_european_union_dynamics | Hungary]] now stands out as a significant challenge for both organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, with calls for its expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Hungary's Background and Western Integration

[[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]], a landlocked country in Central Europe, is surrounded by seven nations: [[slovakias_position_within_nato_and_the_european_union | Slovakia]], Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. With a population of around 9.8 million, it has minority communities including Roma, Germans, Romanians, and Slovaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Linguistically, Hungarian is unique among its neighbors, belonging to a separate language family (Uralic) alongside Finnish and Estonian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Historically, Hungary established its first kingdom in the 11th century but came under Habsburg rule in 1699, later forming the Austro-Hungarian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. After World War I, the Treaty of Trianon made it an independent state but stripped it of almost two-thirds of its traditional territories, a source of lasting bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Allied with Nazi Germany in World War II, Hungary then fell under the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, becoming part of the Warsaw Pact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. A popular uprising against Soviet control was suppressed in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

As the Cold War ended, Hungary transitioned peacefully to democracy, with Soviet troops leaving in June 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It quickly oriented itself towards the West, applying for EU membership in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In March 1999, [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | Hungary]] joined the Czech Republic and [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Poland]] as the first former Warsaw Pact members to join [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Six years later, on May 1, 2004, Hungary, along with nine other countries from Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, joined the [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | European Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Initially, Hungary was seen as a success story of [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | EU and NATO enlargement]], successfully transitioning to democracy and attracting investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Shift Under Viktor Orban

In May 2010, the Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orbán, won a landslide victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. While Orbán had previously served as prime minister (1998-2002) during Hungary's moves towards Western integration and was seen as an internationalist liberal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, his new term brought significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Within months, Orbán introduced measures to restrict press freedoms, leading to [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | EU pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. As he consolidated power, problems grew, with further restrictions on media, civil liberties, and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. By 2014, Orbán openly declared his vision for [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary]] as an "illiberal democracy" based on a "different, special, national approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

His overt nationalism and xenophobia caused wider issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. He antagonized neighbors by strengthening ties to Hungarian communities in their territories and became overtly anti-immigrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. In 2015, he undermined [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | EU solidarity]] during the Refugee Crisis by refusing to resettle asylum seekers, calling them "potential terrorists" and "intruders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Despite mounting criticisms, Orbán seemed unfazed, partly due to the [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | EU's persistent failure to tackle his bad behaviour]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] became adept at the bloc's politics, backing down just enough when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Orbán also received high-level protection from the centre-right European People's Party, the largest bloc in the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Even after the Parliament voted to start [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | infringement proceedings against Hungary]] in 2018, Orbán knew he was safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Any serious action, like the [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | suspension of certain membership rights]], would require the support of all other member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This was unlikely because [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Poland]], having also taken an illiberal turn, served as Hungary's closest ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

As a result, the situation continued to deteriorate. In 2019, Freedom House downgraded [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary's democratic standards]] to "partly free," the only EU member with this rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Observers noted that Hungary had essentially become a corrupt one-party state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, with fears that Orbán and Hungary were becoming a role model for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Ukraine War and Russian Relations

The war in Ukraine brought [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary]] to wider international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Concerns arose that Hungary would block Western action against Moscow due to the close relationship between Orbán and [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | Putin]], and strained relations between Budapest and Kyiv over the Hungarian minority in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Although [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary]] initially hampered [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] efforts to supply military aid to Ukraine by restricting its airspace, Orbán surprised observers by opposing the invasion and supporting EU sanctions against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, this was perceived as a tactical move before elections, as memories of 1956 lingered in Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

After Fidesz won another landslide victory and Orbán was congratulated by [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | Putin]], he quickly changed his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] became increasingly obstructive, attempting to limit sanctions on [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] and refusing to back EU proposals to reduce [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | Russian]] gas consumption, eventually forcing EU members to exempt Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Hungary was already in talks to increase its [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | Russian]] gas supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Furthermore, alongside Turkey, [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary]] has still not ratified [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | Sweden and Finland's membership of NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Orbán continues to express nationalist and racist views, notably stating in July 2022 that Hungarians did not want to become a "mixed race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These comments, widely condemned, even led to a resignation from his advisory staff who called it "pure Nazi text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Reasons for Hungary's Actions (Hypotheses)

Many observers believe Orbán is acting on [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | Russia's behalf]], suggesting [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary]] is Moscow's "Trojan Horse" within the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. While this fits the pattern of Russian interference, caution is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Orbán's position could also be shaped by self-centered factors, including:
*   A genuine commitment to authoritarian national populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Admiration for the Russian leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   A desire to antagonize Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   A way to divert national attention from wholesale corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   Prioritizing Hungary's economic interests over solidarity with EU and [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] partners or neighboring Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Western Response and Future Outlook

Regardless of the reasons, the tide may be turning against Orbán <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. In February 2022, the [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | European Court of Justice ruled that EU money can be withheld]] from members not abiding by fundamental values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Consequently, in September, the [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | European Commission announced plans to withhold 7.5 billion euros of funding]] from [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary]] over persistent public procurement corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. While Budapest has agreed to introduce measures, skepticism remains that Orbán will merely make temporary concessions before reverting to old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Many advocate for tougher steps, including calls for [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary]] to be expelled from [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] and the [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | EU]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, there is currently no mechanism for expelling a country from either body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, and a deep reluctance to pursue such a radical, unprecedented step exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Nonetheless, not taking decisive action carries extreme risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Regardless of whether Orbán is directly under Moscow's influence, [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary's position]] on democratic standards, civil liberties, human rights, and [[hungarys_relations_with_russia_and_ukraine | dealing with Russia]] fundamentally clashes with the values of almost all its EU and [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. By not acting, both organizations risk undermining their own values and encouraging other members to follow [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary's path]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The West must seriously consider its approach to the [[impact of hungary on european union dynamics | Hungary problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

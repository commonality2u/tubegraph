Somaliland, located in the Horn of Africa, has a complex history rooted in colonial divisions and internal conflicts, culminating in its declaration of independence and subsequent [[somaliland_struggle_for_international_recognition | struggle for international recognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>. The territory, approximately 180,000 square kilometers (70,000 square miles), would be the 89th largest member of the United Nations if recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>. Its population is estimated at around 6 million, predominantly ethnically Somali and adhering to Sunni Islam, with the majority belonging to the Isaak clan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:31">[02:50:31]</a>.

## European Imperial Expansion and Colonial Division
The modern [[history_of_somalilands_independence_and_secession | history of Somaliland]] is intrinsically linked to European imperial expansion in Africa during the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. Britain, France, and Italy all established colonial control over areas inhabited by the Somali people in Eastern Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:08">[03:12:08]</a>. This colonial presence persisted until after the Second World War, when decolonization began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:09">[03:23:09]</a>.

## Brief Independence and Union with Italian Somaliland
On June 26, 1960, British Somaliland gained its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:10">[03:28:10]</a>. However, this statehood was short-lived, lasting only five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:07">[03:33:07]</a>. On July 1, 1960, it merged with the newly independent Italian Somaliland to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:09">[03:36:09]</a>. While Somaliland now contests the legality of this union, it was initially welcomed as a step towards the unification of all Somali peoples in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>.

## Growing Tensions and Loss of Autonomy
Problems soon emerged within the Somali Republic. Tensions quickly grew between the two merged parts due to their very different histories and divisions along clan lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>. In 1961, northern military officers staged a coup attempting to restore independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:09">[04:03:09]</a>. Following this, the South stripped Somaliland of its autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:18">[04:08:18]</a>.

## Military Dictatorship and Suppression
Matters worsened in October 1969, when the country's democratic government was overthrown by a military dictatorship led by General Mohamed Siad Barre, commander of Somalia's armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:12">[04:12:12]</a>. Barre promoted an aggressive Somali nationalism and ruthlessly suppressed any separatist movements in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:06">[04:28:06]</a>.

## Reclaiming Independence (1991)
The situation dramatically changed in January 1991 when, after two decades in power, Barre was overthrown and fled Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:10">[04:35:10]</a>. As the South descended into anarchy and inter-clan conflict, the North seized its opportunity to reclaim its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:04">[04:43:04]</a>. The Republic of Somaliland was proclaimed on May 18, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:09">[04:49:09]</a>.

## Consolidation and Quest for International Recognition
In the years following its declaration of independence, Somaliland consolidated its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:04">[04:57:04]</a>. While Somalia was embroiled in civil war, Somaliland emerged as an "oasis of peace and security" in the Horn of Africa, developing effective state structures and democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:05">[05:01:05]</a>.

Despite establishing relations with external actors, including British and American officials and African political figures, Somaliland's efforts to gain full international recognition were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:14">[05:14:14]</a>. It argued that the ongoing political instability in Somalia and its prior independence merited acceptance as a sovereign state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:13">[05:29:13]</a>. However, no country was willing to be the first to formally recognize its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:04">[05:34:04]</a>.

### African Union Fact-Finding Mission
Despite the official reluctance, there was growing sympathy for Somaliland behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:10">[05:43:10]</a>. In 2005, the African Union (AU) sent a fact-finding mission to Somaliland, which ultimately recommended recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:07">[05:48:07]</a>. The report highlighted Somaliland's progress toward becoming a modern state and noted its situation as "unique and self-justified in African political history," arguing that its case should not be linked to opening a "Pandora's Box" of secessionist claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:08">[05:58:08]</a>.

### Continued Challenges to Recognition
Although the AU report seemed to offer a path to eventual full international recognition, Western countries remained reluctant for any recognition to come from African Union or a group of African States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:03">[06:16:03]</a>. Despite the AU mission's steer, no African consensus emerged, and Somaliland remained unrecognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:04">[06:33:04]</a>.

## Recent Developments
On January 1, 2024, news broke of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between Ethiopia and Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:07">[06:42:07]</a>. While the exact terms are undisclosed, it's understood to grant Ethiopia long-term lease over a Red Sea port facility for commercial and military naval use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:06">[07:03:06]</a>. Somaliland's president, Musa Bihi Abdi, stated that under the deal, Ethiopia recognizes Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

However, the legal and political meaning of this announcement remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:13">[07:36:13]</a>. Under international law, recognition requires explicit intent, and merely signing a treaty does not always amount to recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:01">[07:53:01]</a>. Ethiopia's official statement about the agreement did not explicitly mention recognition nor use the term "Republic of Somaliland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:06">[08:33:06]</a>. While the MoU may lay foundations for future recognition, it does not currently constitute formal recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:04">[09:03:04]</a>.

This development has significantly impacted relations with neighboring Somalia, which denounced the MoU and declared it null and void, insisting on its territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:09">[10:09:09]</a>. Somalia has even suggested considering military options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:10">[10:29:10]</a>. The potential Ethiopian recognition is viewed by many countries as a transactional rather than principled step, which could deter broader international acceptance for [[somalilands_quest_for_international_recognition | Somaliland's quest for international recognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:06">[12:12:06]</a>. International actors, including the United States, have reaffirmed support for Somalia's territorial integrity within its 1960 borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:15">[13:22:15]</a>. The [[impact_of_somalilands_unrecognized_status_on_regional_stability | long-term implications]] for Somaliland's recognition remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:02">[14:14:02]</a>.

Greenland, the world's largest island, is a Danish territory that has recently become the subject of international attention due to explicit threats by an incoming US president to seize it [00:00:06]. This has sparked debate about its historical and current political status, as well as its [[geopolitical_significance_of_greenland | geopolitical significance]] [00:00:15].

## Geography and Demographics

Greenland spans 2.2 million square kilometers (840,000 square miles) and lies between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans [00:01:50]. Its closest neighbor, Canada's Ellesmere Island, is 26 km (16 miles) away to the west, while Iceland is 740 km (460 miles) to its east [00:01:54].

The island's population is approximately 56,000 people [00:02:14]. With 80% of the country covered in ice, most inhabitants reside along the coastal regions, including the capital, Nuuk [00:02:18]. Nearly 90% of the population is of native Inuit origin, with the remaining 10% being Danish or of mixed heritage [00:02:26].

## Historical Background

### Early Settlement and Norse Influence
Greenland's history dates back approximately 4,500 years with the arrival of the first settlers from North America [00:02:36]. These early inhabitants survived until the 11th century, when ancestors of the modern Inuit population arrived [00:02:43]. Around the same time, the first Norse settlers came from Iceland but disappeared by the 15th century due due to worsening climate conditions and conflict with the Inuit [00:02:51].

### Danish Colonization
In the early 18th century, the Danes began arriving, leading to Greenland becoming part of the joint state of Denmark-Norway [00:03:03]. This union lasted until 1814 when, under the Treaty of Kiel, Norway was ceded to Sweden, and Denmark retained control over Greenland [00:03:15]. For the next century and a half, Denmark consolidated its control over the island [00:03:26].

### World War II and the Cold War
A "strange twist" occurred during the Second World War [00:03:31]. In 1941, after Denmark fell to Nazi Germany, the United States stepped in, overseeing the territory for several years and establishing an important airbase [00:03:36]. Although Denmark regained control at the war's end, the US base remained, becoming an essential intelligence, early warning, and refueling facility throughout the Cold War [00:03:47].

## Evolution of Political Status

Greenland's colonial status was abolished in 1953, making it formally a Danish province [00:03:59]. In 1979, the territory was granted self-rule [00:04:06]. Most recently, in 2009, local power was expanded significantly, granting Greenlanders control over most aspects of their governance, including health, education, natural resources, and the local economy [00:04:10].

### Current Governance and Ties to Denmark
Despite extensive self-governance, Denmark continues to manage Greenland's foreign affairs, security, and defense [00:04:24]. Denmark also provides a substantial yearly grant of approximately half a billion USD, which accounts for about a fifth of Greenland's income [00:04:29]. Greenland maintains its own political institutions, including a separate prime minister, executive, and parliament [00:04:36].

### Calls for Independence
While close ties persist between Greenland and Denmark, there have been growing calls for independence in recent years, with many believing it is time for Greenland to become a separate sovereign state [00:04:45]. However, concerns exist regarding Greenland's viability as an independent country [00:04:58]. Its small population and continued economic reliance on Denmark make many cautious about breaking away, leading independence to be viewed as a longer-term goal rather than an immediate priority [00:05:05].

This debate has changed recently due to broader geopolitical developments and environmental factors [00:05:21]. As Arctic ice melts due to global warming, Greenland is becoming increasingly significant for new shipping routes and making previously hard-to-reach resources more accessible [00:05:33].

## [[us_interest_in_greenland_under_trump | US Interest in Greenland under Trump]]

It is against this backdrop that [[us_interest_in_greenland_under_trump | Donald Trump]] turned his attention to Greenland [00:05:46]. In December 2024, the president-elect posted a message stating that the United States considered ownership and control of Greenland "essential for its national security and freedom" [00:06:02].

This is not a new idea; [[us_interest_in_greenland_under_trump | Trump previously proposed purchasing Greenland]] in 2019 during his first term [00:06:27]. At that time, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dismissed the suggestion as "absurd," leading [[us_interest_in_greenland_under_trump | Trump to cancel a planned state visit to Denmark]] [00:06:33].

Danish and Greenlandic officials have again rejected [[us_interest_in_greenland_under_trump | Trump's recent calls]], insisting the territory is not for sale and belongs to the people of Greenland [00:06:44]. However, concerns have grown due to [[us_interest_in_greenland_under_trump | Trump's refusal to rule out military action]] to seize Greenland during a January 2025 press conference [00:06:58]. Observers suggest these statements now have a more serious and calculated intent, driven by genuine security concerns over Greenland's status, particularly in the changing [[geopolitical_significance_of_greenland | geopolitical context]] of Russian and Chinese activities in the Arctic [00:07:23].

## Potential Future Political Status

While a peaceful acquisition, such as a purchase, remains the most obvious route for the United States, it would require Greenland's approval, likely involving promises of significant public spending [00:09:01]. If acquired by the US, Greenland's exact status would need to be determined, as full federal statehood would be unlikely due to its tiny population [00:09:22]. It would likely adopt a status similar to Puerto Rico or other US overseas territories [00:09:35]. However, many might view Greenland's current relationship with Denmark as more beneficial in the long run than being under US control [00:09:49].

### Free Association as an Option
A potential option acceptable to all parties is the concept of "free association" [00:12:07]. This allows small independent states to formalize a relationship with a larger country, which then oversees their foreign and defense policies [00:12:17]. The United States already has such agreements with the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, all of which are separate UN members [00:12:27].

This model could be an option for Greenland [00:12:37]. At least one of Greenland's political leaders has raised the possibility of pursuing this relationship, potentially even in conjunction with Denmark, creating a unique hybrid model [00:12:41]. This arrangement could provide Greenland with the independence many desire and the security and support it would still need, while also giving the United States direct control over important aspects of security and defense [00:12:57]. The question remains whether this would satisfy [[us_interest_in_greenland_under_trump | Trump's ambition]], or if he seeks complete US control [00:13:13].

In May 2023, the Moldovan autonomous unit of Gagauzia held elections for a new governor, which became a focal point of [[current_political_tensions_in_gagauzia | renewed tensions]] due to allegations of widespread voting irregularities and [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Russian meddling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The central government in Moldova has contested the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

This situation has raised concerns in a region that once sought to break away from Moldova but was seemingly reintegrated peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Despite being generally seen as a success story of negotiated settlement, the situation is proving less stable than it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Background to Current Tensions

Gagauzia, an autonomous territorial unit in southern Moldova, has a population of around 140,000, with 80% being ethnic Gagauz, a Turkic people who are Orthodox Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Historically, [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Imperial Russia encouraged Gagauz migration]] to Bessarabia (eastern Moldavia) in the early 19th century to counterbalance Romanian nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Russian has become the dominant language in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

After declaring independence in 1990 amid the collapse of the Soviet Union, Gagauzia's conflict with Moldova was resolved peacefully, unlike the ongoing [[current_political_tensions_in_gagauzia | Transnistrian conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In 1994, the Moldovan parliament passed a law granting Gagauzia extensive autonomy, including its own parliament, government, judiciary, symbols, and governor (Bashkan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Russian was also made an official language alongside Gagauz and Moldovan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Crucially, Article 1 of this law stipulated that if Moldova's status as an independent state ever changed (e.g., by joining Romania), Gagauzia would have the right to external self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Escalation of Pro-Russian Sentiment

The situation began to shift in the second decade of the millennium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Following the emergence of a pro-EU administration in Moldova, the country initialed an association and free trade agreement with the European Union in late 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This was perceived by many Gagauz as a "backdoor way" of securing a union with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

In response, the Gagauz administration organized a non-binding referendum in February 2014 on joining the Eurasian Customs Union, a Russian-led trade area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Despite strong opposition from the central Moldovan government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>:
*   With a 70% turnout, 98% voted in favor of the Russian-led Customs Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   97% voted against closer ties to the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   99% endorsed Gagauzia's right to secede if Moldova ever gave up its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Subsequently, Gagauzia continued its distinctly pro-Russian path, electing a new governor in 2015 who strongly supported close ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, EU funding has led to significant infrastructure improvements, and Turkey has expanded its presence, providing a potential counterpoint to [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Moscow's influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## The Latest Electoral Crisis (May 2023)

The immediate source of recent tensions has been the election of a new governor in May 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. While all eight candidates were seen as pro-Russian, Yevgenia Gutsul, representing the populist Shor Party, stood out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The party is named after an oligarch who fled the country following a bank embezzlement scheme and has led anti-government protests in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

In the second-round runoff on May 14, Gutsul won 52% of the vote against the Socialist Party candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

### Allegations of Irregularities

The results are highly contested:
*   Police and prosecutors have claimed widespread irregularities, including vote buying, marring both election rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   Police raided the Electoral Commission's headquarters in Gagauzia and seized ballot papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   The Moldovan government has questioned the validity of the outcome and may try to secure a rerun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

However, the Gagauz parliament has already approved the result, potentially putting the two sides on a collision course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Broader Context and Implications

The election controversies are fed by several factors:
*   **Geopolitical Environment:** The war in neighboring Ukraine has prompted [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Moscow to ramp up activity]] and increase propaganda in Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The Moldovan government claims Russia is trying to undermine the country more generally, with renewed tensions in Transnistria and accusations of Moscow planning a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Moldovan EU Membership Pursuit:** The Moldovan government's pursuit of rapid EU membership has fueled long-standing Gagauz fears about reintegration with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Language Policy:** The Moldovan parliament's decision in March 2023 to refer to the country's national language as "Romanian" rather than "Moldovan" has further strengthened this suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

While there is currently no indication that this will lead to new separatist tensions, as Gagauzia has little to gain by breaking away again given its distance from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, it could raise questions about Gagauzia's future within Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Calls for independence could re-emerge if Moldova joins the EU, which many Gagauz still equate with unification with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

For now, the situation could become an additional source of populist, pro-Russian pressure on the Moldovan government, galvanizing anti-EU sentiment and deepening societal and political divisions within Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The developments in Gagauzia serve as a practical example of how deep-rooted tensions can persist and become sources of instability even decades after separatist territories are reintegrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

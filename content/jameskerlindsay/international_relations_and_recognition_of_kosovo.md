Kosovo's [[kosovo_declaration_of_independence_and_international_response | declaration of independence]] in February 2008 significantly split [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international opinion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While the United States and most of the European Union recognized its independence, many other countries, including Russia and China, remain steadfastly against its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. As a result, over a decade after breaking away from Serbia, Kosovo remains locked outside the United Nations, and its hopes of eventually joining the European Union are on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Unification Talks as a Response to Stalled Recognition
Against this backdrop, there has been growing talk by senior Kosovo political figures about the option of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | uniting with neighbouring Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This idea has been openly raised by two former prime ministers of Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

Albin Kurti, leader of VetÃ«vendosje and winner of recent elections, supported the idea and stated he would vote for unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister, indicated that if Kosovo's hopes of European integration remain blocked, a referendum on unification might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Reasons Behind Unification Talk
Several factors drive the discussion around unification, particularly concerning Kosovo's international standing:
*   **National Identity and Aspiration** Many view the unification of all Albanian territories, sometimes called 'Natural Albania' or 'Greater Albania', as a national aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Some proponents focus on closer unity between Albania and Kosovo as overwhelmingly Albanian countries with a free will to unite, rather than an overtly expansionist message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Practical Realities of Recognition** The pace of recognitions for Kosovo has slowed dramatically; since 2018, only Israel has recognized it (in late 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Simultaneously, Serbia has conducted a diplomatic campaign leading to a number of countries withdrawing their recognitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Kosovo's path to full [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international acceptance]] through United Nations membership is blocked by Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, which means Kosovo is locked out of various parts of the [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Unifying with Albania could indirectly integrate Kosovo into the [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Pressure Tactic for EU Integration** Talk of unification is also seen as a way to apply pressure on countries to unblock Kosovo's path to EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This path is stalled due to opposition from five EU members that do not recognize Kosovo, alongside general concerns about Western Balkan enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Prominent suggestions for unification, such as those by former president Hashim Thaci and former prime minister Ramush Haradinaj, have directly linked the idea to the European Union's failure to offer Kosovo a clear European perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Obstacles to Unification and Wider International Implications
Despite the underlying reasons, the idea of unification faces significant [[political_and_legal_challenges_to_kosovoalbania_unification | legal and political implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> and obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Internal Constitutional Barriers
Kosovo's constitution explicitly outlaws union with another state in its very first article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While constitutional amendments are possible, it would require a two-thirds vote of the 120-member parliament, including two-thirds support from the 20 members representing national minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Of these minority members, 10 are ethnic Serbs, making it highly implausible that enough would vote for unification with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### International Opposition and Geopolitical Concerns
Even if internal political and popular support existed, [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international efforts]] would likely prevent unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **For Non-Recognizing States** Countries that do not recognize Kosovo's independence would view unification as a violation of Serbia's territorial integrity and unlawful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This relates to the broader [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo issue and its impact on Serbia's foreign policy]].
*   **For Recognizing States** For countries that have recognized Kosovo, while normally they might allow the democratic will to prevail if legally done, the wider context is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The real fear is that such a move would trigger a chain reaction across the Western Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. If Kosovo and Albania united, it could lead to pressure for unification from Albanians in North Macedonia and calls from Serbs in the region to be permitted the same, challenging Bosnia and Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The countries that supported Kosovo's independence did so on the explicit basis that this would be the end of the matter, with no further redrawing of borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Therefore, the United States and the European Union would exert enormous pressure to prevent unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This highlights the complex interplay of [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | international relations and national identity in the Balkans]].

## Conclusion
While talks of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification between Kosovo and Albania]] have attracted international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, it seems highly unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Beyond constitutional blockages, it would face fierce opposition from the wider [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international community]], including both states that don't recognize Kosovo and those that do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Such discussions are primarily a strategic move designed to encourage greater [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | international engagement]] to break the deadlock over Kosovo's [[kosovo_declaration_of_independence_and_international_response | international standing]] as an independent state, rather than a genuine attempt to abandon that independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. However, the longer Kosovo remains in limbo, the louder these calls for unification may grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]] over [[Azerbaijan and Armenian conflict in NagornoKarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] escalated into a brief but bloody war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in October and early November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This 44-day conflict resulted in Azerbaijani forces retaking significant territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The war concluded with a Moscow-brokered ceasefire agreement that involved the stationing of Russian peacekeepers in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Historical Context
For nearly three decades, the [[Historical context of the NagornoKarabakh conflict | conflict]] over Nagorno-Karabakh was considered one of the most serious territorial disputes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The issue first emerged with the dissolution of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Nagorno-Karabakh, primarily inhabited by ethnic Armenians, was an autonomous province within Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. As the USSR disintegrated, Nagorno-Karabakh broke away, declaring independence in January 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

This declaration initiated a bitter war where the Armenian side not only consolidated control over Nagorno-Karabakh but also seized several surrounding Azerbaijani districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In subsequent years, efforts were made to resolve the [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]], leading to an agreement on guiding settlement principles, though little progress was made towards a final resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Although often perceived as a "frozen conflict," it was characterized by frequent confrontations along the ceasefire line and several major outbreaks of fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Notable incidents include a four-day [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]] in 2016 that resulted in hundreds of casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, and another outbreak in July 2020, which served as a prelude to the full-scale war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The 2020 Conflict
The full-scale war erupted at the end of September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> and lasted for six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. By the time Russia brokered a ceasefire on November 10, all Armenian-held areas surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, along with a significant portion of Nagorno-Karabakh itself, had been retaken by Azerbaijani forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The remaining areas beyond Azerbaijan's control are now protected by Russian peacekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Armenian Perspectives on the War

### Preparedness and Inevitability
From Armenia's viewpoint, the war was not only expected but also considered unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. There was awareness of Azerbaijan's statements, military buildup, arms purchases, and an increase in incidents along the ceasefire line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Many in Yerevan believed Azerbaijan had decided on [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]] and was not interested in a negotiated settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Explaining the Defeat
The defeat in the 2020 conflict was a sensitive and challenging subject for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, particularly as it challenged a long-held sense of invulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The defeat is often reconciled by a strong sense of anger regarding [[Azerbaijan and Armenian conflict in NagornoKarabakh | Turkey's]] support for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Many Armenians believe [[Azerbaijan and Armenian conflict in NagornoKarabakh | Turkey]] provided equipment, military leadership, and guidance, effectively directing the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. There is a deeply held view that Azerbaijan did not engage in a fair fight, suggesting the outcome would have been different without Turkish and, to some extent, Israeli technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Perception of External Actors
The role of other outside actors is also viewed with complexity:

*   **European Union and United States:** There is a clear sense of disillusionment in Armenia regarding their lack of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Beyond the moral imperative to stop the war, a geopolitical perspective exists, with many references to Armenia's role in preventing the creation of a Turkic arc from Europe to Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Armenians believe their vital position should lead to full support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **[[Role of Russia in the NagornoKarabakh peace process | Russia]]:** While Armenia was considered to have a close relationship with Moscow and many still see Russia as a key ally, there is a real sense of anger and suspicion about Russia's role in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This stems from the fact that Russia only intervened at the last moment, after most Armenian-held territory had been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Any trust in Russia appears to be born more out of a sense of having no other choice, rather than genuine faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## [[2020 Armenia Azerbaijan war impact | Impact on Armenian Society]]
At a political level, the immediate aftermath of the [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]] saw deep unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. A year later, Yerevan, the capital, appears remarkably normal on the surface, with bustling streets, good restaurants, and high-end shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. However, beneath this apparent normality, the war has had a profound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. No family was untouched; many volunteered to fight, thousands were killed, and many are still missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Occasional reminders of the [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]], such as plaques dedicated to fallen soldiers, are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## [[Future of Armenia and NagornoKarabakh | Future Outlook]]
There is a pervasive sense of "unfinished business" in Armenia regarding the 2020 conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Armenian soldiers are still held prisoner by Azerbaijan, with allegations of torture and executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Skirmishes along the new ceasefire line, including heavy fighting in November 2021, continue to occur, leading many to believe that full-scale fighting could erupt again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

For the longer term, outwardly, Armenians have not given up on Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. They believe it is not lost, and that the land will be retaken, sincerely viewing it as, and believing it should be, a part of Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Just as Azerbaijanis spoke of their territory being held by Armenians, Armenians now speak of their territory being held by Azerbaijanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

From the Armenian perspective, the [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]] has not truly ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. A compromise involving some form of territorial autonomy does not currently appear acceptable to either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. It is considered far too soon to discuss any longer-term settlement or reconciliation between Armenia and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Despite the apparent normality, Armenia is described as a country still in a state of denial about what occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

In November 2024, Abkhazia experienced significant political unrest, with protesters storming the parliament building amid growing concerns over Russia's influence in the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This wave of protests culminated in the resignation of Abkhazia's pro-Russian president, leading to the prospect of early elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These events have sparked speculation about the potential strain on Moscow's power in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Complex Relationship of De Facto States and Patrons

Almost all breakaway territories, often known as de facto states, depend on a protector or patron state for their survival due to international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This external power provides political, diplomatic, and economic support, as well as security against the threat of reintegration by the country they separated from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

However, this relationship is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While the de facto state relies on its patron, this dependence can breed considerable resentment, particularly if the patron exerts significant political or economic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Conversely, the patron may prioritize its broader strategic interests over the needs of the breakaway entity, leading to friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. As a result, these relationships, though often mutually beneficial, can be inherently unstable and even erupt into confrontation, as recently highlighted in Abkhazia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Abkhazia: Geography and Historical Background

Abkhazia is located in the South Caucasus, bordering Georgia to its east and Russia to the north, with the Black Sea along its southern coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Its population is estimated to be around a quarter of a million, with ethnic Abkhazians making up about half, alongside Georgians, Armenians, Russians, and other minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Abkhazia has a long history, often maintaining a distinct identity despite being part of medieval Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It came under Russian imperial control in the first half of the 19th century, losing its principality status in 1864 to become a Russian military province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Following the Russian Revolution, Abkhazia was initially incorporated into the Georgian state that emerged in 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. After the Red Army conquered Georgia, Abkhazia became a separate Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. However, this status was terminated in 1931 by Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, when Abkhazia was incorporated into Georgia as the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This led to severe repression, including the deportation of tens of thousands of Abkhaz and their replacement by Russians, Georgians, and Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Path to Russian Dependence

As the Soviet Union weakened in the 1980s, Abkhazia called for separate republic status within the USSR, but unlike [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status|South Ossetia]], it did not immediately seek to break away from Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Following Georgia's independence in 1991, Abkhazia initially accepted continued autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

However, in 1992, believing that Georgia's decision to restore its pre-Soviet constitution would end their autonomy, Abkhaz deputies unilaterally declared independence, triggering a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Abkhaz militias, supported by Russian paramilitaries and equipment, launched a counterattack after Georgian troops briefly seized Sukhumi, the Abkhaz capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. By July 1993, Sukhumi fell to Abkhaz forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

Following further fighting and a ceasefire in May 1994, Russian troops operating under the Commonwealth of Independent States Peacekeeping Force patrolled the buffer zone between Georgia and Abkhazia, and Russia led UN-sponsored peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Over the next decade, peace talks stalled as Abkhazia refused to give up its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

In 2008, following Kosovo's declaration of independence, Abkhazia called for international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The situation escalated, culminating in the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Russia decisively defeated Georgian forces and subsequently recognized both Abkhazia and [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status|South Ossetia]] as independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Increased Russian Presence
Although Moscow's recognition provided Abkhazia with a greater sense of security, Russia steadily increased its presence and influence, becoming a significant internal actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

[[impact_of_russian_economic_and_military_presence_in_abkhazia|Russian economic and military presence in Abkhazia]] deepened significantly:
*   **Economic Dominance**: Russian aid and subsidies funded infrastructure, covered much of the state budget (including pensions and public sector salaries), and Russian trade, investment, and tourism became central to the Abkhaz economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Security & Military**: Russia increased its security and military presence, stationing troops, building bases, and taking direct responsibility for Abkhazia's security, including manning the frontier with Georgia from 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Strategic Partnership**: In 2014, Russia and Abkhazia signed a strategic partnership establishing a joint military force and agreeing to harmonize foreign and defense policies, backed by over $270 million in subsidies over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Recent Tensions and Unrest

Despite the strategic partnership, tensions have been building for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Falling Subsidies**: Russian subsidies have substantially decreased, from $300 million in 2012 to $140 million in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted Abkhazia's tourism-dominated economy and exposed weaknesses in its health service, especially compared to neighboring Georgia, which even offered support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Private Sector Fears**: Despite reduced state support, fears grew over Russian involvement in the private sector, with Russian companies and individuals increasingly buying local businesses and private properties, driving up prices and making ownership difficult for young Abkhazians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The turning point came in November 2024 when Abkhazian authorities proposed a new law extending Russian ownership of local companies and land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Amid claims that this would lead to complete Russian domination, demonstrations erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Protesters stormed the Abkhaz parliament and other government buildings, and attempted to take control of the public broadcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Although the government quickly withdrew the bill, protests continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. On November 19, President Aslan Bzhania resigned, citing a need to maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Interpreting the Unrest: A Tipping Point?

While Russian domination clearly feeds resentment among Abkhazians, with Moscow being a critical factor in almost all aspects of the territory's economic and political life over the past decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, observers caution against over-interpreting these events as a full-scale revolt against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

*   **Not Unprecedented**: This is the third time an Abkhaz leader has been forced from power since 2008, indicating that such unrest is not new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Continued Reliance**: Abkhazia, like any de facto state, cannot easily turn against its patron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Despite frustration, Abkhazians recognize their reliance on Moscow for prosperity and protection, especially as long as they remain internationally isolated and unwilling to reunify with Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Gestures**: Notably, protesters were seen carrying Russian flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Russia's Stance**: The Russian government maintained its distance and did not intervene to support the outgoing leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Potential Future Scenarios

While some Abkhazians might increasingly question if a settlement with Georgia is preferable to Russian domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, there is little sign that this is the dominant view, with most still preferring Russia as their partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

However, this could change in the future. The prospect of [[potential_future_scenarios_for_abkhazias_international_relations|European Union membership]] could be highly influential, offering aid and opportunities for young people across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Yet, this scenario seems unlikely for now, particularly as Georgia appears to be moving further away from the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

Ultimately, the events in Abkhazia highlight a problematic reality for de facto states: by the time they consider reunification with their former parent state, they are often so completely dominated economically, politically, and militarily by their patron state that they cannot pursue an alternative path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This demonstrates that despite declaring independence, de facto states are invariably anything but independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

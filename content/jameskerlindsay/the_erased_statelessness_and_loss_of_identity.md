Imagine an entire identity being deleted, a country suddenly becoming entirely foreign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This scenario became a reality for tens of thousands of Yugoslavs living in Slovenia following its declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This deliberate act of "erasure" constituted a serious human rights violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Background: Slovenia's Independence from Yugoslavia

Slovenia declared independence from [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]] on June 25, 1991, marking the thirtieth anniversary in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While it largely avoided the widespread violence that engulfed much of the rest of the federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, the process of its [[selfdetermination_and_sovereignty_issues | self-determination]] brought about a unique human rights crisis.

Slovenia is located in South East Europe, covering 20,000 square kilometres (7,800 square miles), making it the 150th largest of 193 UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Its population is approximately 2.1 million, ranking 149th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. According to the 2002 census, 83% of the population was ethnic Slovenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The largest minorities included Serbs (2%), Croats (1.8%), and Muslims (1.6%, mainly Bosniaks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Other groups included Hungarians, Italians, [[national_identity_and_aspirations_of_albanians | Albanians]], and Roma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Before 1918, Slovenia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. After World War I, it joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed the Kingdom of [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]] in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Following World War II, it became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]], one of six republics alongside Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. As the most economically advanced region, Slovenia attracted around 200,000 economic migrants from other parts of [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]], particularly Croatia and Bosnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The death of [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavian]] leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980 initiated a process of state collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. By the end of the decade, the country faced threats as republics sought different paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In December 1990, Slovenia held an independence referendum, with 96% voting to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. When Slovenia declared independence on June 25, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, the [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslav]] National Army attempted to suppress the secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, after days of conflict and facing a larger challenge in Croatia, a ceasefire was agreed, effectively allowing Slovenia to go its own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Act of Erasure

As part of its [[selfdetermination_and_sovereignty_issues | state-building]] process, Slovenia enacted legislation requiring all [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslav]] citizens living in the country to apply for Slovenian citizenship by December 26, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. While 170,000 people applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, tens of thousands failed to meet the deadline, often because they did not understand the significance of the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Some applications were rejected, particularly from those who had served in the [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslav]] Army and opposed Slovenia's secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

In February 1992, less than two months after the deadline, the Slovenian government ordered that all who had not applied for citizenship be deleted from the list of permanent residents and registered as foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Any Slovenian documents they held, such as identity cards or driver's licenses, were annulled, with reports of documents being shredded at government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In total, 25,671 people, roughly one percent of the population, were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Impact on the Erased

The consequences for those known as "the erased" were catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>:
*   They were deprived of access to state services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   They lost pensions, state housing, healthcare, and other social rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   Many lost their jobs and found it impossible to secure new employment without proof of a right to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   Families were reduced to poverty, lacking unemployment benefits or other state aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Children were denied education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   In severe cases, individuals born in Slovenia but not registered elsewhere in the federation became effectively stateless persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Many of the erased had no choice but to leave Slovenia, returning to war-torn [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]] or emigrating elsewhere in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Others were simply deported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Those who remained faced immense difficulties in resolving their status, as the Slovenian government initially showed little interest in the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Legal Battles and International Pressure

The issue finally reached the Slovenian Constitutional Court in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. In a landmark ruling, the court declared the deletion of records unlawful and ordered the government to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. In response, Slovenia introduced new legislation, offering a three-month window for applications for citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, this legislation did not address the problems the erased had faced over the previous decade, nor did it allow those who had been expelled to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

In 2003, the Constitutional Court issued another ruling, stating that the rights of those affected should be applied retrospectively from the point their records were deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Despite this, the government still refused to implement retrospective measures to help the affected individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Many still faced problems with registration or securing full state pensions, and there was no compensation for their suffering or legal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

The issue became increasingly politicised, with many ordinary Slovenes, in a country trying to disassociate itself from its [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | Yugoslav past]], lacking sympathy for a group largely seen as foreign economic migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Some even painted the erased as enemies of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This sentiment was underscored in an April 2004 referendum, where 94% voted "No" to returning rights to the erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Despite Slovenia joining the European Union on May 1, 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, and facing increasing pressure from human rights organisations and international bodies like the United Nations and the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, little action was taken for years.

In 2006, eleven of the erased brought their case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Four years later, the court ruled in their favour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. After a challenge by the Slovenian government, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR confirmed in 2012 that Slovenia had violated Articles 8, 13, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantee respect for private and family life, the right to an effective remedy, and the prohibition of discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Slovenia was given one year to establish a compensation scheme but failed to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Consequently, in 2014, the Court ordered the government to pay nearly a quarter of a million euros in compensation to the applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Resolution and Continued Struggle

Faced with a potential wave of similar cases, the Slovenian government finally complied with the rulings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. It committed to ending the human rights violations and established a compensation scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. By February 2016, 22 million euros had been paid out to around 5,300 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. On May 25, 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe declared itself satisfied with Slovenia's measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

However, despite these developments, the [[impact_and_legacy_of_the_erased_in_slovenia | struggle continued]] for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Many of the erased remain ineligible for the scheme or cannot afford the legal fees to file a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Even three decades after the events, many of "The Erased" are still fighting for justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary of the Erasure
> The case of "The Erased" in Slovenia highlights the complex [[international_relations_and state_borders | international relations]] and human rights issues that can arise during [[selfdetermination_and_sovereignty_issues | state dissolution]] and secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While Slovenia avoided the brutal genocides seen elsewhere in [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]], and the vast majority of Yugoslavs in the country were granted citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, a significant number faced severe human rights violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. It was only when faced with significant financial penalties that the Slovenian government finally acted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The story of "The Erased" remains a lesser-known chapter of the chaos and conflict that emerged from the collapse of [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

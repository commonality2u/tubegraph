Syria experienced profound political instability and frequent coups following its independence, leading to the rise of the Assad regime, which eventually fell after over five decades of rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. On December 8, 2024, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fled Damascus as opposition forces entered the city, marking the end of a regime that had governed the country for more than 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This collapse occurred rapidly, over just a couple of weeks, despite Assad seeming firmly in control and being welcomed back into international politics shortly before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This event is considered one of the most significant political collapses in modern Middle Eastern history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Historical Context

Syria, formally the Syrian Arab Republic, is located in the Middle East, bordering Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon, with a Mediterranean coastline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Its population is estimated at around 21 million, though millions have fled due to the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While most Syrians are Arab, there are also Kurdish and Turkic communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Sunni Muslims constitute three-quarters of the population, but other prominent religious groups include Alawites (an offshoot of Shia Islam, around 10%), Shia Muslims, and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

After an ancient history that included being a Roman province and embracing Islam, Syria fell under Ottoman rule in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Following World War I, it came under French control until declaring independence during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Syria became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## A Period of Instability (1948-1970)

In May 1948, Syria joined other Arab states in an unsuccessful attack on the newly formed state of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Its defeat initiated a period of profound [[history_of_political_instability_in_serbia | political instability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. A coup in March 1949 was followed by three more over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

In 1958, Syria merged with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic, hoping to foster greater Arab unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. However, this partnership was short-lived, as rising discontent with Egyptian dominance led to another coup in 1961, causing Syria to leave the union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. [[history_of_political_instability_in_serbia | Political instability]], with frequent coups and government changes, continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## The Rise of the Assad Regime

The tide began to turn in February 1966, when, following yet another coup, a young Alawite Air Force General, Hafez al-Assad, became the defense minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Despite Syria's humiliating defeat in the 1967 war against Israel, Assad managed to retain his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. In November 1970, he launched a coup to seize power, propelling him to the presidency the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Hafez al-Assad's ascension fundamentally changed Syria, bringing an end to a quarter-century of [[history_of_political_instability_in_serbia | political instability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. He quickly consolidated his power by introducing repressive measures to limit dissent and placing members of the Alawite community in key positions of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Under his rule, Syria bolstered its position in the Arab world, becoming a leading opponent of the United States and Israel, and actively supporting Palestinian causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Syria also sent troops to Lebanon's Civil War and forged close ties with revolutionary Iran, aiding its support for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## The Succession and the Civil War

On June 10, 2000, Hafez al-Assad died after 30 years in office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Power was immediately passed to his 35-year-old son, Bashar al-Assad, a British-trained doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Hopes for reform under the younger Assad proved premature, as he maintained his father's tight control over the state and continued the country's opposition to Israel and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

The first serious cracks in the Assads' power emerged in 2011 with the outbreak of the Arab Spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Protests erupted in Syria, and despite international calls for restraint, Assad launched a violent crackdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This response failed to quell the uprising, leading to the country falling into a fully-fledged [[human_rights_abuses_and_conflict_in_syria | Civil War]] by 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Initially, anti-Assad forces seemed to be winning, gaining recognition from various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, the United States hesitated to become actively involved even after allegations of chemical weapon use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. By 2015, the tide shifted in Assad's favor with crucial support from Russia and Iran, including air support and ground troops like Hezbollah militants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Western attention also diverted to the growing threat from radical Islamist groups like Al-Qaeda and Islamic State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. By 2020, the Assad regime had retaken almost 70% of the country, appearing to have won the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This led to his slow but sure reintegration into the Arab world, with Syria's suspension from the Arab League lifted in May 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## The Final Collapse (2024)

While the opposition forces seemed defeated, they were consolidating control in the northwest, recruiting, and improving equipment, including drone forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Regional and international events further strengthened their position: Russia was preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, and Iran's ground support was limited by Israel's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Against this backdrop, Syria's [[human_rights_abuses_and_conflict_in_syria | Civil War]] reignited in late November 2024 with a surprise offensive by rebel forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group that emerged from al-Qaeda, and including Turkish-backed forces, the rebels swiftly captured key cities such as Aleppo, Homs, and Hama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. They pushed southwards towards Damascus, facing minimal resistance as government forces lost the will to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

On December 7, 2024, the rebels entered Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. With Russia and Iran unable to provide aid, the Assad regime collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Hours later, Bashar al-Assad fled the country to Moscow, where he was granted asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. After 53 years, the Assad regime was overthrown far faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Aftermath and Future Concerns

The fall of the Assad regime marks a pivotal moment for the Middle East, welcomed internationally as a "fundamental act of justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. However, there are significant concerns about Syria's short, medium, and long-term future, as well as the wider region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Questions remain about whether Syria will descend into chaos or establish a stable administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The nature of the new government (Islamist or inclusive), the fate of minorities like Kurds and Alawites, and the implications for regional powers like Israel and Turkey, as well as the influence of Russia and Iran, are all critical unanswered questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The overthrow of Assad will significantly alter the [[influence_of_middle_eastern_geopolitics_on_syria | geopolitical landscape of the Middle East]], raising many questions about Syria's future and its broader international security implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

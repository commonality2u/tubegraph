Since [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's exit from the European Union]] in January 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, there has been little sign of the benefits promised by the Leave campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Instead, mounting evidence points to severe economic damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Background

The decision to leave the European Union divided the UK population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, and seven years after the 2016 vote, the issue remains central to British politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Britain joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, primarily for economic benefits rather than political integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Although membership was endorsed in a 1975 referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, tensions grew by the 1980s, particularly over funding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

During the 2016 referendum, the Remain campaign emphasized the economic advantages of continued EU membership, warning of disastrous consequences if the UK left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The Leave campaign, however, dismissed these concerns, focusing instead on sovereignty and immigration, promising that Brexit would restore independence and allow more funds for public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Post-Brexit Economic Consequences

Since the UK formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, it has become evident that Brexit has not delivered on its economic promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Economic Downturn and GDP Impact
Britain has experienced a significant economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent economic forecasts, has estimated that Brexit has resulted in a four percent drop in British Gross Domestic Product (GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Inflation and Cost of Living
The shortage of EU workers following Brexit has contributed to driving up inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This, in turn, has led to increases in interest rates, affecting the cost of living and mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Trade Difficulties and Limited New Deals
New rules implemented post-Brexit have made trade extremely difficult for many sectors, notably agriculture and fishing, which had largely supported leaving the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. While the government has highlighted new trade agreements with other countries, these deals have offered minimal benefits and are insufficient to offset the economic costs of reduced trade with the European Union, which remains the UK's largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Broader Adverse Effects
Brexit has also had wider adverse effects, such as making it much harder for British citizens to live and work across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Many European countries now require special skills or independent financial means for British citizens to relocate there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Furthermore, few of the promised domestic benefits, such as increased spending on healthcare, have materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Future Outlook
The growing evidence of negative economic impacts has led to increased public discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Recent polls indicate that a clear majority of the public now believes that Brexit was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This shift in [[public_opinion_on_rejoining_the_eu | public opinion on rejoining the EU]] has naturally raised questions about whether Brexit could be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

While a full rejoining process would involve aligning with EU laws and securing political approval from member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, economic considerations would be central to any future discussions. For instance, rejoining the Single Market would help rebuild trade and boost the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. However, this would necessitate a renewed commitment to accepting freedom of movement, which remains a politically sensitive issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

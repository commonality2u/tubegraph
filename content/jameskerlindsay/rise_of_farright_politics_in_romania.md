On November 24th, Romania held the first round of its presidential election, leading to a shock result that included a largely unknown far-right candidate in the runoff amid claims of social media manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This development has prompted calls for investigation both within [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]] and internationally, raising significant implications for European security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Electoral Manipulation and Hybrid Warfare

The recent events in [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]] are viewed against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hybrid warfare, a critical element of modern international relations that blends traditional military tactics with non-military strategies like cyberattacks, propaganda, and political interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Electoral manipulation, often through disinformation campaigns on social media, has become a potent tool for states to destabilize adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Over the past decade, [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russia]] has faced accusations of using electoral manipulation against numerous Western states, including the 2016 US presidential election, the UK's Brexit referendum, and allegations in countries like France, Germany, and the Baltic states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## The Shock Election Result

In the first round of the latest presidential elections, a far-right outsider scored a stunning victory, prompting claims of [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russian meddling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While 13 candidates contested the election, the main focus was on the two front-runners: Marcel Ciolacu, the serving Prime Minister and leader of the PSD, and Elena Lasconi, a journalist and provincial mayor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

However, the most votes (22.95%) went to an independent candidate, Călin Georgescu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Lasconi received 19.17% of the vote, narrowly beating Ciolacu, who came in at 19.15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This outcome was described as a "political earthquake" in [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]], marking the first time since the fall of communism that the PSD candidate failed to reach the second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Călin Georgescu: The Far-Right Candidate

Călin Georgescu, a 62-year-old agricultural engineer, is known for his extreme views and conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. His stance includes:
*   Praising [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]]'s Second World War pro-Nazi leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   Being overtly pro-[[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russian]] and anti-NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   Speaking out against [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]]'s support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Georgescu's lead was particularly astonishing given that polling consistently showed his support at less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Social Media Manipulation Allegations

Attention quickly focused on Georgescu's social media activity, particularly on TikTok, where numerous accounts appeared to have amplified his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This led to suspicions of a coordinated effort to manipulate public opinion, with blame firmly pointed at [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. While the Kremlin has denied these allegations, the first-round results caused considerable concern within [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]] and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Reactions and Concerns

### Internal Reactions

Within [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]], widespread protests erupted, and calls emerged for an investigation into Georgescu's funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. President Klaus Iohannis convened the Supreme Council of Defense to analyze potential national security risks from state and non-state actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### International Reactions

Internationally, many of [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]]'s NATO and EU partners are watching the situation closely, though cautiously, to avoid perceived interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. In Brussels, the head of the centrist liberal group at the European Parliament called for TikTok's CEO to address the allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Neighboring [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Moldova]], which shares close cultural and linguistic ties with [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Romania]] and has also faced recent allegations of [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russian electoral manipulation]], expressed concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Its pro-European president, Maia Sandu, emphasized that the two countries "cannot let the Kremlin dictate their relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Implications for European Security

Georgescu's advancement to the runoff has unsettled many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Opponents fear that a Georgescu presidency could shift [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]]'s foreign policy away from the EU and NATO, aligning it more closely with [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russian interests]], particularly by cutting off support to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

A shift towards [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russia]] by [[history_and_political_evolution_of_romania | Romania]] would be a significant blow to both NATO and the European Union, especially as neighboring [[hungarys_political_direction_under_viktor_orban | Hungary]] and [[slovakias_shifting_political_landscape | Slovakia]] have grown steadily closer to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This raises the worrying prospect of a disruptive bloc emerging that unites three of the four NATO members bordering Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

While some optimists believe Georgescu is unlikely to win the majority needed, the parliamentary elections held after the presidential poll showed the PSD winning the largest share of the vote, ahead of the far-right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. However, combined with support for another far-right candidate who secured around 13% of the vote, this suggests that up to a third of the electorate supports nationalist-populist figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Broader Trends

Regardless of the election outcome, the results highlight critical points:
*   If [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Moscow]] is implicated (though no firm evidence yet exists), it would again signal [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russia]]'s willingness to use electoral manipulation to undermine the West, effectively "weaponizing democracy against itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This underscores the urgency of strengthening cyber defenses, combating online disinformation, and ensuring the integrity of democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   The vote underscores the significant power of social media to shape political processes in unexpected and disruptive ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   As seen elsewhere, far-right views have become increasingly mainstream and resonate with worryingly large parts of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

These trends, with or without [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russian interference]], raise crucial questions about the future of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

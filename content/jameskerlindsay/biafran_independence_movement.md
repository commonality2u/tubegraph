In early June 2021, Nigeria attracted international attention by banning Twitter after the platform deleted a tweet from the country's president [00:00:00]. The tweet referred to the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafra War]] of the 1960s and implied that the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] might again use force against resurgent [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | separatist sentiment]] [00:00:09]. This event highlighted the ongoing significance of the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran independence movement]] [00:00:18].

When an attempted [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] is defeated, the territory may be reincorporated with little to no further talks of [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | separatism]] [00:00:48]. However, resentment can linger, leading to the campaign resurfacing decades later [00:00:56]. The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran independence campaign]] in southeast Nigeria is a notable example of a resurgent [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secessionist movement]] [00:01:07].

## Historical Context

In the late 1960s, Nigeria experienced one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern history to suppress the self-proclaimed Republic of Biafra [00:01:16]. Over two and a half years, millions of lives were lost before the breakaway territory was defeated and re-incorporated into the federation [00:01:24]. Yet, more than 50 years later, pro-independence sentiment is rising again, posing a risk of renewed serious conflict [00:01:33].

Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the continent's most populous country with approximately 200 million inhabitants [00:01:52]. It comprises numerous ethnic groups, primarily the predominantly Muslim Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Christian and Muslim Yoruba in the southwest, and the predominantly Christian Igbo in the southeast [00:01:59].

### Origins of the Conflict

The story of Biafra begins with British colonization in the 19th century [00:02:23]. Initially, Nigeria was divided into two distinct colonies: the Muslim-dominated Northern Nigerian Protectorate and the predominantly Christian Southern Nigerian Protectorate, which were merged in 1914 [00:02:29]. In 1954, the country was formally constituted as a federation of three regions, roughly aligning with the main ethnic groups: the Hausa-Fulani dominated Northern Region, the Yoruba-dominated Western Region, and the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region [00:02:40]. Nigeria gained independence in 1960 [00:02:57].

However, tensions soon emerged [00:03:02]. A military coup by southern officers in January 1966, following disputed elections, led to the assassination of many leading political figures, including the premier of the Northern Region [00:03:04]. In reprisal attacks, thousands of ethnic Igbo living in the north were murdered, prompting over a million others to flee south to the Eastern Region and fueling calls for the territory to break away [00:03:17].

Although a deal for a looser federal arrangement was reportedly reached between the Eastern leadership and the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | federal government]] in early 1967, the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | federal government]] appeared to renege by announcing a plan to divide the country's three regions into 12 new parts [00:03:30]. This move was seen as an attempt to undermine the East, leading its leader, Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, to declare independence on May 30, 1967 [00:03:45].

### The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] (1967-1970)

Just under six weeks after Biafra's declaration of independence, the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_mount | government]] launched a full-scale invasion to suppress the [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] [00:03:55]. The ensuing conflict, known as the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] or the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Nigerian Civil War]], became a [[the_humanitarian_crisis_during_the_biafran_war | humanitarian catastrophe]] [00:04:01]. Beyond combat fatalities, an estimated one to three million people died from hunger due to supply cutoffs to the breakaway region [00:04:07]. By January 1970, the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Nigerian government]], supported by key [[international_responses_to_the_biafran_secession | international allies]] such as Britain and the Soviet Union, had defeated the last pockets of resistance [00:04:16]. The Republic of Biafra ceased to exist on January 15, 1970 [00:04:26].

## Post-War Period and Resurgence

In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Federal Government]] called for national unity [00:04:32]. General Yakubu Gowon, the country's leader, famously stated there were "no victors and no vanquished" [00:04:37]. This led to a policy centered on the "Three R's": reintegration, reconciliation, and reconstruction [00:04:44]. The trauma of the war and the scale of defeat seemingly kept Igbo independence sentiment in check [00:04:52].

However, by the late 1990s, the situation began to change [00:05:00]. This shift was partly due to the passage of time, as new generations emerged without direct experience of the conflict [00:05:04]. Deeper roots for the resurgence included a widespread feeling that, despite the official "Three R's" policy, the Igbo continued to face hostility and discrimination [00:05:13]. Despite being one of the country's three main groups, they were systematically excluded from key positions, including the highest political offices [00:05:24]. Many argued that the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] deliberately neglected economic development in the region, providing lower federal funding and few infrastructure projects [00:05:32].

Another contributing factor was the emergence of conflict in the Niger Delta in the 1990s [00:05:43]. Although the Delta, much of which was claimed by Biafra, became Sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil-producing region, little of the revenue reached local communities, which instead experienced significant environmental damage [00:05:48]. This sense of general marginalization, coupled with exploitation and repression in the Delta, appeared to kickstart the revival of the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran independence movement]] [00:06:04].

### Key Organizations and Events of the Revival

In 1999, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) was established to spearhead efforts for [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | breakaway]] [00:06:16]. Several other groups, some offshoots of MASSOB, emerged in subsequent years [00:06:24]. The most significant of these was the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, a charismatic figure based in Britain [00:06:30]. His media outlet, Radio Biafra, has become a leading voice for the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran independence movement]] [00:06:38].

The [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Nigerian Government]] promptly cracked down on neo-Biafran sentiment [00:06:46]. This included frequent clashes with pro-independence supporters, the outlawing of MASSOB membership in 2005, and the arrest of its leader, Ralph Uwazuruike, in 2007 [00:06:51].

Current tensions largely trace back to key developments in 2015 [00:07:02]. The first was the election of Muhammadu Buhari as Nigerian president [00:07:08]. A former general and military ruler from the Muslim North, Buhari made it clear he would prioritize areas that supported him and would take a hard line against the country's growing number of insurgencies and [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | separatist movements]], including pro-Biafran organizations [00:07:13].

The second key factor was the arrest of IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu during a trip to Nigeria in October 2015 [00:07:31]. Facing charges of sedition and treason, which carry the death penalty, his supporters launched a series of protests [00:07:39]. These protests escalated into violence and harsh repression by [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] forces, including what Amnesty International described as the deliberate use of deadly force [00:07:47]. Although Kanu was eventually released on bail in April 2017 and has since left Nigeria, these events strengthened IPOB's standing [00:07:56]. Later that year, the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Nigerian Government]] officially designated IPOB as a terrorist organization, though Kanu insisted it was dedicated to peaceful means for a referendum on [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran independence]] [00:08:04].

Since then, tensions in the southeast have been exacerbated by the "Herder-Farmer Conflict," or Herder War [00:08:18]. Climate change has led to increased desertification in the north, pushing Muslim Fulani cattle herders south into lands held by settled farmers [00:08:26]. This conflict has resulted in over 10,000 deaths and tens of thousands displaced [00:08:36]. As herders encroached on Igbo territory, President Buhari, himself a Fulani, has been accused of not doing enough to stop the attacks [00:08:43]. Following deadly clashes in late 2020, IPOB announced the establishment of an armed wing, the Eastern Security Network, claiming it was to defend against herder attacks [00:08:51]. This development has led to further violence with [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] forces [00:09:00]. This rising violence prompted President Buhari's tweet, which was later removed and led to Nigeria's decision to ban Twitter [00:09:07].

## Current Challenges and Outlook

The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | independence movement]] faces significant opposition from the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Federal Government]] and internal challenges [00:09:20]. Opinion within the Igbo community is divided, not only between MASSOB and the now more dominant IPOB, but also generationally [00:09:27]. While the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | independence movement]] reportedly enjoys growing support among disaffected youth, the Igbo establishment, particularly older members who remember the war, are more cautious or even opposed to [[history_of_the_biafra_war | independence]] and [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secessionist movements]] [00:09:40].

Practical issues also persist, such as the unclear boundaries of a potential Biafran state [00:09:57]. Some supporters advocate for the inclusion of all areas claimed by Biafra in the 1960s, while others focus on a core group of Igbo-dominated states in the southeast [00:10:03]. This is a crucial point, as many non-Igbo populations within the historical Biafran territory oppose [[history_of_the_biafra_war | independence]] and wish to remain part of Nigeria [00:10:14]. However, focusing solely on smaller Igbo areas would leave any Biafran state landlocked within Nigeria and exclude most of the key oil-producing regions [00:10:21].

Currently, there appears to be little immediate likelihood that the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] will concede to demands for a referendum on [[history_of_the_biafra_war | independence]], let alone permit [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] [00:10:37]. Facing growing [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | separatist challenges]] elsewhere, the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] seems determined to continue cracking down on [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran independence sentiment]] [00:10:45]. Fears are growing that IPOB's new militancy could lead to an increasingly violent phase in the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | independence campaign]] [00:10:55].

The case of Biafra highlights that the end of a [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secessionist conflict]] does not always mean the end of a [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secessionist movement]] [00:11:04]. Fifty years after one of modern history's most brutal [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | separatist conflicts]], the movement for an independent Biafra is again gaining ground [00:11:11]. This resurgence is fueled by a deep sense of marginalization and [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] neglect, and is exacerbated by internal tensions between the Muslim North and Christian South, now further complicated by a conflict seemingly driven by climate change [00:11:20].

The key question remains how the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Nigerian Government]] will respond [00:11:37]. While concrete steps could address the situation, the president's recent threats, which Twitter deemed serious enough to remove, suggest the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | government]] is not planning to back down [00:11:41]. This raises the prospect of a return to serious violence in southeast Nigeria [00:11:57]. Although a new [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] seems unlikely, a major new Biafran conflict is certainly possible [00:12:02].

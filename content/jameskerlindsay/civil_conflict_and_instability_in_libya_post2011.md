In [[impact_of_the_arab_spring_on_libya|2011]], the former longtime leader of Libya, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, was captured and executed by rebel forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Hopes for a new era of stability soon vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Instead, Libya collapsed further into [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict|civil war]], causing widespread suffering and making the country a significant source of instability in North Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This outcome has led to claims that eliminating Gaddafi was in fact a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The overthrow of foreign leaders is a controversial issue in [[international_intervention_and_its_consequences_in_libya|international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While there is a legal injunction against intervention, there's also the argument that the international community has a responsibility to uphold human rights and protect populations from dictators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, efforts to remove such leaders can have unforeseen and dramatic consequences, often leading to a political vacuum that is disastrous for countries and causes broader regional and international insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi (2011)

Despite Gaddafi's history of supporting terrorist organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> and the UN sanctions imposed on his regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, Libya had begun a significant foreign policy shift by the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Gaddafi agreed to hand over Lockerbie bombing suspects and paid compensation for the death of a British policewoman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, leading to his reintegration into the international fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi pledged to abandon efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This led to renewed relations with the US and EU, and Libya gained a seat on the UN Security Council and chaired the African Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Catalyst for Intervention: The Arab Spring
Everything changed in December 2010 with the outbreak of the [[impact_of_the_arab_spring_on_libya|Arab Spring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Widespread protests spread across the region, leading to demonstrations in Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. A brutal crackdown by security forces fueled public anger and led to high-profile defections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, but Gaddafi vowed to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The opposition formed the Transitional National Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, and as violence escalated, the UN imposed sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### International Intervention
When Gaddafi's forces regained momentum against the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, Britain and France called for direct intervention, proposing a no-fly zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Although Germany and the US initially urged caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, the Arab League supported the measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. As a result, the UN Security Council voted in favor of military measures to halt the fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. By the end of March 2011, NATO began missile and airstrikes against Gaddafi's forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Britain, France, and Italy also sent military advisers to aid the rebels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

In August 2011, opposition forces took Tripoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The Transitional National Council was recognized as the lawful government, and Gaddafi, who had fled, was captured and killed by rebel forces on October 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Post-2011 Civil Conflict and Instability

Despite hopes for a fresh start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, the disparate groups that overthrew Gaddafi soon turned on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### The Second Libyan Civil War
In 2014, this internal conflict escalated into another full-scale conflict, known as the Second Libyan Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The Government of National Accord (GNA) in the west fought against the forces of the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The conflict was further complicated by the involvement of various outside actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>:
*   The United Nations and most Western states recognized the GNA, which was supported by Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Many countries, including Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, supported the LNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

In addition to indigenous groups, Libya became a magnet for Islamist organizations, including ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This was tragically highlighted in September 2012 when the US ambassador to Libya was murdered by militants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Lingering Instability
In October 2020, nine years of war formally concluded with a permanent ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. However, while this was intended to pave the way for presidential elections, they have yet to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, and the situation remains precarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Consequences and Debates

The conflict has taken a massive toll on Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Once considered one of Africa's wealthiest countries with considerable social welfare programs, Libya has been decimated politically, socially, and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Tens of thousands have been killed, and millions have been displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

A major point of contention is how Western states rapidly shifted from accepting Gaddafi to fully endorsing regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This debate has played out in Western policy circles:
*   In 2016, Barack Obama stated that the failure to plan for Gaddafi's overthrow was the most significant foreign policy failure of his presidency, though he still stood by the decision to oust him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   Others have been far more critical, arguing that Gaddafi's overthrow has been a disaster for Libya and for international security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The ousting of Gaddafi, much like Saddam Hussein in Iraq, raises crucial questions about the conduct of [[international_intervention_and_its_consequences_in_libya|international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. While Gaddafi was a despotic leader and Libya sponsored terrorism, he had been trying to re-engage with international society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. The cases of Libya and Iraq should prompt observers to carefully consider how to respond to unstable autocrats in the international system and weigh the broader effects of removing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Almost all breakaway territories, often referred to as de facto states, rely on a protector or patron state to ensure their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Facing international isolation, these entities depend on an external power for political and diplomatic support, economic aid and assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, and crucial security against the threat of reintegration from the country they seceded from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Patron states are thus a vital element in secessionist conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Complexities of the Patron-De Facto State Relationship

While the relationship between de facto states and their patrons can be mutually beneficial, it is also inherently complex and potentially unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The de facto territory's reliance on an outside power can lead to considerable resentment, particularly if the patron exerts significant political or economic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Conversely, the patron may prioritize its broader strategic interests over the specific needs and wishes of the breakaway entity, further generating friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This dynamic can sometimes escalate into open confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Abkhazia and Russia

Recent tensions in Abkhazia highlight the complexities of this relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Having broken away from Georgia in the 1990s, Abkhazia has relied on Russia for over three decades for its political, security, and economic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. However, there are growing signs that this relationship is under strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Historical Context of Dependence

Abkhazia has a long history, often maintaining a distinct identity even when part of medieval Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. It came under Russian imperial control in the first half of the 19th century, losing its principality status in 1864 to become a Russian military province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Following the Russian Revolution, Abkhazia was incorporated into the Georgian state but later became a separate Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This near-equal status ended in 1931 when Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, integrated Abkhazia into Georgia as an autonomous republic, leading to severe repression and deportations of Abkhaz people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

After Georgia's independence in 1991, Abkhazia initially accepted continued autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. However, believing its autonomy would end with Georgia's restoration of its pre-Soviet constitution in 1992, Abkhaz deputies unilaterally declared independence, sparking a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Abkhaz militias, strengthened by Russian paramilitaries and equipment, seized control of the capital, Sukhumi, in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. A Russian-brokered ceasefire led to the deployment of Russian troops as part of the Commonwealth of Independent States Peacekeeping Force, patrolling the buffer zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, and Russia also led UN-sponsored peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

In 2008, following renewed fighting in South Ossetia, a full-scale Russian invasion of Georgia ensued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. Russia decisively defeated Georgian forces and subsequently recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Russia's Deepening Influence

Following its recognition, Moscow actively campaigned for broader international acceptance of Abkhazia, though it remained largely isolated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Russia steadily increased its presence, becoming a significant internal actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

Russia's influence extended to various sectors:
*   **Political:** Exerting considerable influence over political developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Economic:** Strengthening its economic dominance through aid and subsidies for infrastructure, state budgets, pensions, and public sector salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Russian trade, investment, and tourism became central to Abkhazia's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Security and Military:** Increasing its military presence by stationing troops and building bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Russia took direct responsibility for Abkhazia's security, including manning the frontier with Georgia in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Alignment:** A strategic partnership signed in 2014 established a joint military force and committed Abkhazia to harmonize its foreign and defense policies with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. This deal included over $270 million in subsidies to Abkhazia over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

### Recent Unrest and the Limits of Independence

Tensions have been building in Abkhazia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Russian subsidies significantly decreased, from $300 million in 2012 to $140 million in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted Abkhazia's tourism-dependent economy and exposed weaknesses in its health service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Despite falling state support, fears grew over increased Russian involvement in the private sector, with Russian entities buying local businesses and private properties, driving up prices and making ownership difficult for young Abkhazians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

In November 2024, proposed legislation extending Russian ownership of local companies and land sparked protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. Demonstrators, fearing complete Russian domination, stormed the Abkhaz parliament and other government buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. Although the bill was withdrawn, protests continued, leading to the resignation of Abkhaz president Aslan Bzhania on November 19, who cited the need to maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

### Interpretation: Not a Full-Scale Revolt

While Russian domination fuels resentment, observers caution against overinterpreting these events as a full-scale revolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. Such unrest is not new; it is the third time a leader has been forced from power since 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Abkhazia, like any de facto state, cannot simply turn against its patron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. As long as Abkhazia remains internationally isolated and unwilling to reunify with Georgia, it relies on Moscow for prosperity and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Protestors even carried Russian flags, indicating a complex sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

The Russian government also kept its distance and did not intervene to support the Abkhaz leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. While some Abkhaz may consider a settlement with Georgia preferable to Russian domination, most still view Russia as their preferred partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. The pull of potential European Union membership, seen in other cases, could influence future sentiment by offering more aid and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>, but this scenario seems unlikely now as Georgia moves away from the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

### The Paradox of Independence

The situation in Abkhazia highlights a problematic reality: even if de facto states desire reunification with their former parent state over continued patron control, they are often too economically, politically, and militarily dominated by the patron state to pursue an alternative path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. By pursuing independence from one state, they become wholly dependent on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. This underscores the degree to which de facto states, despite declaring independence, are invariably anything but independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

In May 2023, the Moldovan autonomous unit of Gagauzia held elections for a new governor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These elections were met with allegations of [[electoral_controversies_in_gagauzia | widespread voting irregularities]] and [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Russian meddling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As a result, the central Moldovan government has contested the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This situation has raised concerns about the possibility of renewed tensions in a region that previously sought to break away but had seemingly been fully reintegrated in a rare example of a peacefully resolved separatist conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Background of Gagauzia

The Republic of Moldova is located in Southeast Europe, landlocked between Romania and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It spans 34,000 square kilometers (13,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Around 4,200 square kilometers of its territory are controlled by the internationally unrecognized breakaway territory of [[MoldovaTransnistria relations | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The country's population is 2.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, with Romanian-speaking Moldovans forming the largest group, alongside prominent minority communities such as Russians, Ukrainians, and the Gagauz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Gagauzia, also known as Gagauz Yeri, is situated in southern Moldova, near the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It is an autonomous territorial unit of Moldova, covering approximately 1,850 square kilometers (715 square miles), which is about 5.5% of Moldova's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Its population is around 140,000, with 80% being ethnic Gagauz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The Gagauz are a Turkic people whose original language is closely related to Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Unlike most other Turkic nations who follow Islam, the Gagauz are Orthodox Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Russian is now generally spoken in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## [[historical_overview_of_gagauzia_and_moldova_relations | Historical Overview and Path to Autonomy]]

The origins of the Gagauz people are debated, with theories suggesting they were a Turkic tribe that migrated to Southeast Europe before the 12th-century Turkish invasions, or Greeks/Bulgarians who adopted a Turkic language but retained Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Evidence suggests they lived in Bulgaria before the Ottoman Empire's expansion in the 15th and 16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Their modern story begins in the early 19th century with the expansion of Imperial Russia into Ottoman territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. In 1812, Russia took control of eastern Moldavia, known as Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. To counter Romanian nationalism, Russia persuaded Christian Orthodox Gagauz to migrate northwards and settle in Bessarabia after expelling Muslim Tatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, these demographic changes did not dampen Romanian nationalism, especially after western Moldavia united with Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

In 1918, Bessarabia declared independence amidst the Russian Revolution and World War I, then united with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This union was short-lived, as the Soviet Union seized the region in July 1941, creating the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Soviet authorities attempted to quell pro-Romanian sentiment by promoting a separate and distinct [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Moldovan identity]] and bringing in ethnic Russian and Ukrainian settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. They also focused on assimilating the Gagauz, leading to Russian supplanting the Turkic Gagauz language in higher societal levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

As the Soviet Union crumbled in the late 1980s, the Moldovan SSR leadership reasserted a Romanian identity, leading other nationalities to push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. In November 1989, a special Gagauz Congress proclaimed a separate autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) within the Moldavian SSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This was rejected by local communist authorities, and on August 19, 1990, Gagauzia declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Clashes erupted when Moldovan police and security units moved to quell the rebellion, leading to Soviet troops intervening to keep the peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Upon the Soviet Union's collapse in December 1991, the Republic of Moldova became an independent state, facing two secessionist disputes, including the conflict in [[MoldovaTransnistria relations | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Unlike Transnistria, the conflict in Gagauzia was resolved relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. By 1994, early suggestions of unification between Moldova and Romania had subsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Moldovan authorities eased Gagauz concerns by introducing greater religious and language rights and legalizing the country's Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The Gagauz leadership, remaining strongly pro-Russian, shifted from demanding independence to seeking territorial autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

This culminated in 1994 when the Moldovan parliament passed a law making Gagauzia an autonomous territorial unit with extensive control over its affairs, including its own parliament, government, judiciary, symbols, and a governor (bashqan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Russian became an official language alongside Gagauz and Moldovan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Crucially, Article 1 of the law stipulated that if Moldova's status as an independent state ever changed, the people of Gagauzia would have the rights of external self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This meant if Moldova joined Romania, Gagauzia could become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. In March 1995, a referendum in areas with a substantial Gagauz population sealed the agreement, with 30 of 36 regions agreeing to join the new autonomous unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Renewed Pro-Russian Sentiment

For years, the issue of Gagauzia appeared settled, especially during the pro-Russian Communist government in Moldova from 2001 to 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. However, by the second decade of the Millennium, the situation began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. With the emergence of a pro-EU administration, Moldova initialed an association and free trade agreement with the European Union in late 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Many Gagauz saw this as a backdoor to unification with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, leading them to call for closer ties to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In February 2014, the Gagauz administration organized a non-binding referendum on joining the Eurasian Customs Union, a [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Russian-led trade area]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Despite strong opposition from the Moldovan central government, the results were overwhelmingly in favor: with a 70% turnout, 98% voted for the Russian-led Customs Union, 97% against closer ties to the EU, and 99% endorsed Gagauzia's right to secede if Moldova ever gave up its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

After this, Gagauzia continued its distinctly pro-Russian path, electing a new governor in 2015 who strongly supported close ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. However, subtle shifts began to occur: EU funding improved the region's infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, and Turkey expanded its presence in Gagauzia, providing a potential counterpoint to [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Moscow's influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Triggers for the Latest Crisis

The recent crisis has been fueled by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>:
*   **Geopolitical Environment**: The war in neighboring Ukraine has led Moscow to ramp up its activity, with outside observers noting a substantial increase in [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Russian propaganda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Undermining Moldova**: The Moldovan government claims [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Russia has been trying to undermine the country]] more generally, citing renewed tensions in [[MoldovaTransnistria relations | Transnistria]] and accusations by Moldova's president of a planned coup by Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Domestic Protests**: Months of mass anti-government protests have occurred in the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **EU Membership Push**: The Moldovan government's pursuit of rapid EU membership has fed long-standing Gagauz fears about reintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Language Policy**: The Moldovan parliament's decision in March 2023 to refer to the country's national language as Romanian rather than [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Moldovan]] has strengthened Gagauz suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## The May 2023 Gubernatorial Election

The immediate source of tension has been the election of a new governor in May 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. While all eight candidates were considered pro-Russian, Yevgenia Gutsu, representing the populist Shore Party, stood out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The party is named after an oligarch who fled the country after a massive bank embezzlement scheme, and who has led recent anti-government protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

In the second round runoff on May 14, Gutsu won 52% of the vote against the Socialist Party candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. However, the results are highly contested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Police and prosecutors have claimed [[electoral_controversies_in_gagauzia | widespread irregularities]], including vote buying, in both election rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This led to police raiding the Electoral Commission's headquarters in Gagauzia and seizing ballot papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The Moldovan government has questioned the validity of the outcome and may try to secure a rerun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. However, the Gagauz parliament has already approved the result, potentially putting the two sides on a collision course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Potential Implications

For the moment, there is no indication that these tensions will lead to new separatist efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Gagauzia would have little to gain, as its distance from Russia means Moscow could not offer real support if it tried to break away again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

However, looking further ahead, these developments could raise questions about Gagauzia's future within Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Calls for the region to break away and become independent could arise if Moldova decides to join the European Union, a development many Gagauz still equate with unification with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Yet, the prospect of Moldovan EU membership is still a distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

In the short term, the situation could become an additional source of populist, pro-Russian pressure on the Moldovan government, helping to galvanize anti-EU sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This would deepen societal and political divisions within Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. The recent developments in Gagauzia serve as a practical example of how deep-rooted tensions can persist and become sources of instability, even decades after separatist territories are reintegrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

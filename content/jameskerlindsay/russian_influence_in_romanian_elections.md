On November 24, Romania held the first round of its presidential election, which resulted in a shock outcome: a largely unknown [[rise_of_farright_politics_in_romania | far-right candidate]] advanced to the runoff [00:00:05]. This outcome has prompted claims of social media manipulation and calls for an investigation both within Romania and internationally [00:00:14]. The situation carries significant implications for European security [00:00:30].

## Hybrid Warfare and Electoral Manipulation

Hybrid warfare, a critical element of modern international relations, blends traditional military tactics with non-military strategies like cyberattacks, propaganda, and political interference to destabilize adversaries [00:00:43]. A particularly worrying development is the increasing use of electoral manipulation, often through disinformation campaigns on social media [00:01:02]. Such manipulations can profoundly affect the future of countries, regions, and the international system [00:01:12].

Over the past decade, Russia has been accused of using electoral manipulation against numerous Western states [00:01:20]. Allegations have surfaced concerning the 2016 US presidential election, the UK's Brexit referendum, and elections in France, Germany, and the Baltic states [00:01:27]. It is against this backdrop that claims of [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian meddling]] have now emerged in Romania [00:01:41].

## Romania: Political System and Recent History

Romania is located in Southeast Europe, bordered by Ukraine and Moldova to its north, Bulgaria to its south, Serbia to its southwest, and Hungary to its west [01:55]. The Black Sea lies along its east coast [02:09]. Covering approximately 240,000 square kilometers, it is Europe's 12th largest country with a population of around 19 million, predominantly ethnic Romanian, alongside minorities including Hungarians, Roma, Germans, Ukrainians, and Turks [02:12].

Romania operates under a semi-presidential system, mirroring the French model [02:34]. The president appoints the prime minister, who leads domestic policy, but the president holds a central role in foreign and security policy, chairing the Supreme Council of National Defense [02:39].

The modern Romanian state emerged in the mid-19th century with the union of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1859, achieving full independence in 1879 and becoming a kingdom in 1881 [03:16]. After World War I, Romania expanded significantly, acquiring regions like Transylvania and Bessarabia (now modern [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Moldova]]) [03:33]. During World War II, under Ion Antonescu, Romania initially sided with Nazi Germany before switching to the Allies in 1944 [03:45]. Despite this, it fell under Soviet control, becoming a communist state in 1947 [03:57]. Nicolae Ceaușescu's dictatorial rule, which began in 1965, ended in 1989 with a revolution [04:12].

After the fall of communism, Ion Iliescu became president in 1990, leading the Social Democratic Party (PSD) [04:48]. His slow reforms and perceived maintenance of communist-era structures led to his defeat in 1996 [05:07]. However, he returned to power in 2000 amidst ongoing problems like deep-rooted corruption [05:26]. Despite concerns about his leadership, Romania made significant progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration, joining NATO in 2004 [05:38].

In 2004, Traian Băsescu, a pro-Western leader, became president and introduced measures to combat corruption, leading to Romania's entry into the European Union in 2007 [05:59]. His aggressive style led to political challenges, including an unsuccessful impeachment attempt [06:19]. Klaus Iohannis, of the center-right National Liberal Party, became president in 2014, seen as a "safe pair of hands" [06:38]. Although re-elected in 2019, his term had mixed results, facing domestic controversies but strengthening Romania's place in NATO and the EU [06:55]. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Romania strongly supported its neighbor with military and humanitarian aid, becoming a crucial route for Ukrainian exports and refugees [07:22].

## The 2024 Presidential Election and Allegations of Interference

On November 24, 2024, Romania held the first round of voting to elect a successor to President Iohannis [07:51]. While 13 candidates stood, the front-runners were expected to be Marcel Ciolacu (serving prime minister and PSD leader) and Elena Lasconi (a former journalist and mayor) [08:15].

However, the results were a "political earthquake" [08:42]. Călin Georgescu, an independent candidate, received the most votes (22.95%), narrowly ahead of Lasconi (19.17%) and Ciolacu (19.15%) [08:33]. This was the first time since the fall of communism that the PSD candidate failed to reach the second round [08:55].

Georgescu, a 62-year-old agricultural engineer, is known for his extreme views and conspiracy theories [09:01]. He has praised Romania's pro-Nazi World War II leadership [09:11], is known to be pro-Russian and anti-NATO [09:16], and has spoken out against Romania's support for Ukraine [09:19]. His sudden lead was astonishing, as polls consistently showed his support at less than 10% [09:24].

Attention quickly turned to his social media activity, particularly on TikTok, where numerous accounts appeared to have amplified his videos [09:40]. This quickly led to suspicions of a coordinated effort to manipulate public opinion, with the finger of blame pointed firmly at Russia [09:50]. The Kremlin has flatly denied these allegations [09:59].

## Reactions and Concerns

The outcome of the first round has caused considerable concern both within Romania and abroad [10:04].

### Internal Reactions
*   Widespread protests have occurred, and calls have emerged for an investigation into Georgescu's funding [10:10].
*   President Iohannis convened the Supreme Council of National Defense to analyze potential national security risks from state and non-state actors [10:19].

### International Reactions
*   Many of Romania's NATO and EU partners are watching the situation closely, though treading cautiously to avoid interfering in another member state's elections [10:33].
*   In Brussels, the head of a centrist liberal group in the European Parliament has called on TikTok's CEO to address the allegations before European lawmakers [10:48].
*   Neighboring [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Moldova]], which has close cultural and linguistic ties to Romania, has also expressed concern [10:57]. Moldova has faced recent allegations of [[electoral_controversies_in_gagauzia | Russian electoral manipulation]] [11:05], and its pro-European president, Maia Sandu, stated that the two countries cannot let the Kremlin dictate their relationship [11:10].

## Implications and Future Outlook

An appeal to the Constitutional Court on a technical matter led to a recount, but no evidence of fraud was found, clearing the way for the second round to be held as planned on December 8 [11:21].

Many are concerned about the implications if Georgescu wins [11:36]. Opponents fear his presidency could shift Romania's foreign policy away from the EU and NATO, aligning it more closely with [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian interests]], particularly by cutting off support to Ukraine [11:44]. Such a shift would be a significant blow to NATO and the European Union, especially as neighboring Hungary and Slovakia have grown closer to Moscow, raising the prospect of a "disruptive bloc" emerging among three of the four NATO members bordering Ukraine [11:57].

Optimists suggest it is highly unlikely Georgescu will win the majority needed [12:24]. This view is supported by parliamentary elections held after the presidential poll, where the PSD won the largest share of the vote, ahead of the [[rise_of_farright_politics_in_romania | far-right]] [12:34]. However, the combined support for Georgescu and another [[rise_of_farright_politics_in_romania | far-right candidate]] (who secured about 13% of the vote) suggests that up to a third of the electorate supports nationalist-populist figures [12:44].

Regardless of the final outcome, the results highlight several critical points:
*   If Moscow is implicated—though there is no firm evidence yet—it would again signal [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia's willingness to use electoral manipulation]] to undermine the West, effectively "weaponizing democracy against itself" [13:04].
*   This underscores the urgency of strengthening cyber defenses, combating online disinformation, and ensuring the integrity of democratic processes [13:20].
*   The vote also highlights the power of social media to shape political processes in unexpected ways [13:38].
*   Furthermore, it shows that [[rise_of_farright_politics_in_romania | far-right views]] are becoming more mainstream and resonate with worrying large parts of society [13:47].

These trends, with or without [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian interference]], raise crucial questions about the future of liberal democracy [13:56].

New Caledonia, a French territory in the South Pacific, is considered a strategically vital foothold for France, which is determined to maintain its presence there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Recent widespread rioting in May 2024, described by French President Emmanuel Macron as an "unprecedented insurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, has raised significant questions about geopolitics and the role of [[history_and_geopolitical_context_of_pacific_islands | hybrid threats]] in modern international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### France's Strategic Interest

France's determination to hold onto New Caledonia is underscored by its perception of the territory as a strategically vital foothold in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This strategic importance became particularly pronounced after the third and final independence vote in 2021, when vital strategic factors came into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Rising Pacific Tensions and France's Role

The geopolitical landscape of the Pacific region plays a significant role in France's stance on New Caledonia:
*   **China's Growing Influence** China's expanding influence across the Pacific has prompted France to seek to maintain its own independent presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **AUKUS Alliance** A close alliance forming between Britain, the United States, and Australia further highlights the need for France to project its power in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Macron's Visits** French President Emmanuel Macron's high-profile visit to New Caledonia and the wider South Pacific in July 2023 emphasized this commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Following the May 2024 unrest, Macron made an emergency visit to the island to try to quell tensions and underscored the political seriousness of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### External Influence: The Azerbaijan Accusation

In a bizarre twist to the recent unrest, France has claimed that the violence in New Caledonia was stirred up by another country: Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Baku Initiative Group** An organization called the Baku Initiative Group, seemingly with direct support from the Azerbaijani government, has become increasingly active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Motivation** The group's stated aim is to support French liberation and anti-colonialist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. This is reportedly in retaliation for French support for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Strategies** While Azerbaijan firmly rejects the accusation, if true, it highlights how [[history_and_geopolitical_context_of_pacific_islands | hybrid strategies]] can emerge in unexpected ways and places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Long-term Geopolitical Implications

While France has managed to resecure control over New Caledonia in the short term, the violent clashes raise questions about the longer-term future of this strategically important Pacific territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Any new insurgency would highlight continued French colonial rule, which many perceive as being secured by a deliberate step to manipulate the voter base, thereby feeding local resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Although New Caledonia may not become a significant hard security problem for Paris compared to other regions where it operates, it will nonetheless carry long-term political consequences and costs for France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Russian influence and involvement have been a persistent factor in the autonomous Moldovan unit of Gagauzia, leading to renewed tensions and concerns about its future within Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Russian Influence

The presence and influence of Russia in Gagauzia trace back to the early 19th century:
*   **Imperial Expansion**: In 1812, Imperial Russia gained control of Bessarabia, the eastern part of Moldavia, from the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Demographic Manipulation**: To counter Romanian nationalism, Russia encouraged Christian Orthodox Gagauz people to migrate northward and settle in Bessarabia, displacing Muslim Tatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Soviet Era Assimilation**: After the Soviet Union seized the region in 1941, creating the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet authorities promoted a distinct Moldovan identity and brought in ethnic Russian and Ukrainian settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. They also focused on assimilating the Gagauz, leading to Russian steadily supplanting the Turkic Gagauz language, especially in higher society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. As a result, Russian is now generally spoken in the Gagauz region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Period and Renewed Tensions

As the Soviet Union collapsed, the Moldovan SSR reasserted a Romanian identity, causing other nationalities, including the Gagauz, to push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Early Secession Attempts**: In November 1989, a Gagauz Congress declared a separate autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Moldavian SSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This was rejected, and on August 19, 1990, Gagauzia declared independence, leading to clashes that required Soviet troops to step in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Peaceful Resolution**: Unlike the conflict in [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Transnistria]], the conflict in Gagauzia was resolved peacefully by 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This was partly due to the Moldovan authorities easing Gagauz concerns and the Gagauz leadership, which remained strongly pro-Russian, shifting its demands from independence to territorial autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The 1994 law establishing Gagauzia as an autonomous territorial unit stipulated Russian as an official language alongside Gagauz and Moldovan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Contemporary Manifestations of Russian Influence

Recent developments highlight the ongoing [[current_political_tensions_in_gagauzia | current political tensions in Gagauzia]] and the role of Russian influence:
*   **Shift Towards Eurasia**: In the second decade of the millennium, following a pro-EU administration in Moldova, many Gagauz saw Moldova's association agreement with the European Union as a backdoor to unification with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. In response, they called for closer ties to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **2014 Referendum**: In February 2014, the Gagauz administration organized a non-binding referendum on joining the Eurasian Customs Union, a Russian-led trade area. Despite strong opposition from Chisinau, 98% voted in favor of the Russian-led union with a 70% turnout, while 97% voted against closer ties to the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Crucially, 99% endorsed Gagauzia's right to secede if Moldova ever relinquished its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Pro-Russian Leadership**: Gagauzia continued its distinctly pro-Russian path, electing a new governor in 2015 who strongly supported close ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Influence of the War in Ukraine**: The war in neighboring Ukraine has significantly impacted the political environment, leading Moscow to ramp up its activity, with outside observers noting a substantial increase in Russian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The Moldovan government has also broadly claimed that Russia is trying to undermine the country, including renewed tensions in [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Transnistria]], and the Moldovan president has accused Moscow of planning a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **[[electoral_controversies_in_gagauzia | Electoral Controversies in Gagauzia]] (May 2023)**: The election of a new governor in May 2023 was the immediate source of recent tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. All eight candidates were seen as pro-Russian, with Yevgenia Gutsul of the populist Shore Party winning 52% of the vote in the runoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Amidst allegations of widespread voting irregularities and Russian meddling, the central government has contested the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, with police and prosecutors claiming vote buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While there's no immediate indication of a new separatist push, and Gagauzia would have little to gain given its distance from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, the situation raises questions about Gagauzia's future within Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Calls for the region to break away and become independent could arise if Moldova decides to join the European Union, which many Gagauz still equate with unification with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

For now, the developments could serve as an additional source of populist, pro-Russian pressure on the Moldovan government, helping to galvanize anti-EU sentiment and deepen societal and political divisions within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This illustrates how deep-rooted tensions can persist even after separatist territories are reintegrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

In September 2023, US President Joe Biden paid a state visit to Vietnam, invited by the Secretary General of the Communist Party, Vietnam's most senior political leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This visit saw the two countries sign a [[vietnam_us_comprehensive_strategic_partnership | comprehensive strategic partnership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Hailed as a historic moment by both governments, it marks an extraordinary turnaround in ties between two nations with a notoriously difficult past and fundamental ideological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The relationship between the United States and Vietnam serves as a prime example of how former warring countries can establish a close strategic partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite fighting one of the most bitter and brutal wars in modern times, they have forged an increasingly close relationship while maintaining ongoing ideological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Historical Context Leading to Conflict

Vietnam, located in Southeast Asia, has a long history, emerging with its first monarchy around 5,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It was heavily influenced by China politically and culturally, eventually coming under direct Chinese rule until 938 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Everything changed in the 19th century with European colonial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. France began taking control of the southern part of the country in the 1850s, steadily expanding its holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. By 1887, France merged its territories, including present-day Cambodia and Laos, to form the Union of French Indochina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Under French rule, Vietnam's traditional monarchy was dismantled, and the country was heavily exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Resentment grew, leading to an anti-colonial movement, including a Communist Party formed in 1925 under Ho Chi Minh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The outbreak of World War II significantly altered the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. After France's defeat by Nazi Germany, Vietnam was occupied by Imperial Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Following Japan's defeat, Ho Chi Minh declared the creation of an independent communist state, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which sparked the First Indochina War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Vietnamese guerrilla forces from the communist-controlled North, supported by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, fought the French army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Washington, fearing a communist takeover, supported France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. France eventually gave up, signing a peace agreement in July 1954 that divided the country pending national elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_vietnam_war_on_vietnam_and_the_us | Vietnam War]] (Second Indochina War)

The partition was rejected by the United States and South Vietnam, which had declared independence as the Republic of Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This led to the second Indochina War, better known as the [[impact_of_vietnam_war_on_vietnam_and_the_us | Vietnam War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. US support for the South steadily increased from the early 1960s, with over half a million US personnel on the ground by the latter half of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The war became increasingly brutal, with the US launching devastating bombing campaigns and using chemicals to destroy forestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

By 1970, with growing opposition at home, the US began drawing down its presence and engaged in peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. An agreement in 1973 stipulated the final withdrawal of US forces and peaceful reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. However, the conflict continued for several more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. On April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese troops captured Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, uniting the country under communist control as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Post-War Aftermath and Normalization

The war profoundly affected both Vietnam and the United States socially, politically, and economically, shaping their postwar relations for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Impact on Vietnam
> The war left much of Vietnam destroyed, with an estimated three million dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Lingering issues included continuing deaths from mines and unexploded bombs, and long-term environmental damage, illness, and disability from chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Vietnam linked any normalization of ties to significant development aid and assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Impact on the United States
> The US lost the war—its first loss in history—with almost 60,000 troops killed and over 2,500 personnel listed as missing in action or prisoners of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. As a result, Washington imposed an embargo on Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This hindered Vietnam's reconstruction and left it reliant on the Soviet Union, especially after its relations with communist China collapsed in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Despite the bitter legacy, changes began in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Vietnam's Communist Party, while remaining in power, began opening its economy and agreed to assist with the issue of US personnel missing in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. In return, Washington allowed non-governmental aid organizations to engage with Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

This process accelerated after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which deprived Vietnam of a crucial ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. With ongoing tensions with Beijing, Vietnam was forced to rethink its orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Simultaneously, attitudes in the United States shifted as immediate memories of the [[impact_of_vietnam_war_on_vietnam_and_the_us | Vietnam War]] faded, and the US emerged as the sole hyperpower, accepting the need for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

In 1994, following efforts by two senior US senators who had served in Vietnam, the United States lifted its embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The following year, the two countries normalized their relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Strengthening Relations and Lingering Issues

By the new millennium, relations were rapidly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Bill Clinton became the first US president to visit Vietnam since the war's end in November 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Barack Obama followed in May 2016, and George W. Bush and Donald Trump also visited for multilateral meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Relations continued to strengthen, building on the sizeable Vietnamese diaspora in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. [[trade_and_economic_ties_between_the_us_and_vietnam | Economic ties]] developed rapidly, with investment and trade growing, underpinned by agreements signed in 2001 and 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Both countries established educational and cultural programs and launched initiatives to address environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Despite flourishing ties, critical differences remain:
*   **Trade Imbalance** Recent figures show bilateral trade at around US$150 billion a year, with 80 percent comprising Vietnamese exports to the United States, raising questions about market access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Democracy and Human Rights** Concerns about Vietnam's authoritarian state and serious corruption persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The most recent State Department report highlights problems related to freedoms of expression, freedom of movement, arbitrary arrest, judicial independence, and cruel and unusual punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Security Concerns: The China Factor

The primary factor now driving the US-Vietnam relationship is mutual concern over China's growing regional and international significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

[[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | China-Vietnam relations]] have been strained since the 1970s, despite China's support for the North during the [[impact_of_vietnam_war_on_vietnam_and_the_us | Vietnam War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. A brief conflict occurred in 1979, followed by sporadic border skirmishes in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. While diplomatic relations were restored in 1991, tensions continue, particularly over the South China Sea, where China has increasingly asserted its territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

This dispute has been a key factor shaping the relationship between Vietnam and the United States over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It has driven increased defense and security cooperation, including regular discussions, US provision of military equipment and training, and even joint military exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

However, Vietnam's relations with China are complex. China remains Vietnam's largest trading partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. As neighbors ruled by communist parties, they share ideological and political similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Furthermore, Vietnam has no wish for a full-scale conflict with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | China-Vietnam relationship]] is a delicate balance of cooperation and rivalry, shaped by historical, economic, and geopolitical factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

China appears to recognize the shift following the latest meeting between Biden and the Vietnamese leadership, seemingly rattled by the deepening ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. In October 2023, just a month after Biden's visit, China's President Xi Jinping issued a heartfelt appeal for Vietnam to consider the "good times" their countries had previously enjoyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. As tensions continue to escalate in the South China Sea, it seems Vietnam will continue to move ever closer to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

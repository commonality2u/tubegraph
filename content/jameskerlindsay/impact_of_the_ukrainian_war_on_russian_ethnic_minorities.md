In January 2024, significant unrest erupted in the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan, as thousands participated in violent protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This growing discontent is linked to the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] and its disproportionate impact on Russia's ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Many observers question if this could signal the beginning of greater internal pressures that might lead to the country's fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Background: War and Speculation of Russian Collapse

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 quickly prompted widespread speculation that the war could backfire on Moscow and result in the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. As the war progressed and more troops were drawn into the conflict, it was argued that some of Russia's restive regions might seize the opportunity to rebel and seek independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, these anticipated internal pressures did not materialize immediately, with Russia's outer regions remaining under Moscow's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Bashkortostan: A Case Study of Growing Tensions

The large-scale rioting in Bashkortostan has reignited questions about whether the ongoing [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] is indeed fueling separatism within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Pre-War Grievances

Bashkortostan, Russia's sixth-largest republic by area and first in population with four million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, has a complex history and significant mineral wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Despite signing an agreement with Moscow in 1994 that granted it extensive autonomy and control over natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, the situation has become increasingly strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Reasons for this include:
*   **Centralization of Power:** A steady rollback of the republic's autonomy, with power increasingly centralized in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Economic Exploitation and Environmental Damage:** Growing unhappiness about the region's economic exploitation, tied to substantial environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Interethnic Tensions:** Increased tensions, particularly between the Bashkirs and Tatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Social Movements:** Resurgence in support for increased language and cultural rights, and the emergence of social and ecological movements like "Bashkort," which was banned for extremism in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### War's Aggravating Factors

The [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] has further exacerbated these tensions, as Russia's outlying regions and ethnic communities have been disproportionately affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This impact is felt both in terms of casualties among their populations and reduced government spending, as state funds are diverted to the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### The Fail Alsynov Case and Protests

The deep-rooted disenchantment in Bashkortostan escalated into wider protests following the arrest of activist Fail Alsynov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Alsynov, a former leader of the banned group Bashkort, was arrested for inciting racial hatred while protesting gold mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. He had previously raised concerns about the disproportionate casualties from Bashkortostan and other poorer regions in the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]], openly calling the mobilization a "genocide" of the Bashkir people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

On January 17, 2024, Alsynov was sentenced to four years in a penal colony, sparking outrage among thousands of his supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Protests quickly led to clashes with riot police, who used tear gas and batons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Subsequent demonstrations erupted, including a major one in the capital, Ufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The situation was further inflamed by claims of police brutality and the death of a protester in police custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. These demonstrations represent one of the most serious outbreaks of ethnic tensions in recent years and the largest protest faced by Russian authorities since the start of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Kremlin's Response

The protests visibly rattled the local leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Bashkortostan's leader, Radiy Khabirov, claimed outside forces were behind the protests, and the local government moved to suppress further unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Warnings have been issued that demonstrators could face charges of mass rioting, carrying a 15-year jail term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Social media pages promoting demonstrations have been taken offline, and a local singer is reportedly under investigation for calling on people to join protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

Despite the seriousness of the protests, Moscow initially appeared to distance itself from the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disputed that it amounted to mass unrest, calling the events "individual instances" and a "local problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Wider Implications

While the protests in Bashkortostan involved several thousand demonstrators, a small fraction of the population, and have since quietened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, they highlight a broader potential for unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Russia's considerable ethnic diversity is coupled with widespread discontent driven by discrimination, economic deprivation, and increasing anger over the disproportionate losses faced by minorities in the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

The rioting in Bashkortostan, the most serious outbreak of ethnic rioting in Russia since the start of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, demonstrates how the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | conflict in Ukraine]] has the potential to catalyze deeper ethnic resentment based on local grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In this sense, these protests could be a very worrying development for the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

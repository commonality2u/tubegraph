Concerns are rising that [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] may be on the brink of a major military offensive against Syria's Kurds, with reports of increased troop movements and activity by [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey's]] proxy forces in Syria pointing to an imminent full-scale assault on Kurdish-held territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Historical Context of Turkey-Kurdish Relations

The relationship between [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] and the Kurds is long and complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, plans were drafted to divide the Anatolian Peninsula, which included the possibility of creating a Kurdish homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, these plans were thwarted by Turkish nationalist forces under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. With the establishment of the Republic of [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] in 1923, hopes for a Kurdish state ended, leaving the Kurds divided across five countries: [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]], Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

> [!INFO] Irredentism
> In international relations, irredentism refers to efforts by a state or group to claim territories perceived as part of its historical or cultural homeland. This often involves incorporating others with shared ethnic, linguistic, or religious ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Other countries typically view such ambitions as a fundamental threat to their territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The relationship between [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] and the Kurds is a significant modern example of this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Rise of the PKK and KRG

In 1984, a new insurgency emerged in [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] when the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) launched a campaign for Kurdish independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This violent insurgency, initially rural, expanded into [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey's]] towns and cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The issue gained a broader regional dimension in the early 1990s with the establishment of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq after the First Gulf War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This development raised [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkish]] fears of a potential Kurdish state, and the PKK began using the mountainous areas of northern Iraq as bases for attacks on [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Despite the arrest of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in 1999 and sporadic peace efforts, [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] has remained highly apprehensive about Kurdish efforts to establish a state, either within its borders or in neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Syrian Civil War and Kurdish Autonomy

The Arab Spring in 2011 led to widespread protests across the Middle East, escalating into a civil war in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. As Bashar al-Assad's forces battled opposition, Kurdish groups in northern Syria, primarily the PYD and its armed wing, the YPG, seized the opportunity to establish self-rule, eventually declaring the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

[[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] immediately viewed this as a significant threat, given the PYD's ties to the PKK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | Ankara]] initially had limited ability to curb Kurdish autonomy because the rise of ISIS led key Western countries, including the United States, to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in combating the Islamic State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. While [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] conducted some limited operations against the Kurds during this period, their scope was restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Operation Peace Spring (2019)

By 2019, with ISIS largely defeated, the situation changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Following discussions with [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Turkey's]] president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Trump administration announced the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] capitalized on this, launching an invasion known as **Operation Peace Spring** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

The operation had two main objectives:
1.  **Establish a "safe zone"**: To facilitate the repatriation of millions of Syrian refugees living in [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
2.  **Diminish Kurdish control**: To reduce Kurdish influence in northern and northeastern Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Ramifications of Operation Peace Spring
> Operation Peace Spring had wider consequences:
> *   It forced the SDF to seek support from Russia and the Assad regime, inadvertently bolstering their power in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
> *   It led to a resurgence of ISIS, as Kurdish forces were diverted, allowing Islamist militants to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Following significant international diplomatic pressure and threats of sanctions, [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] agreed to a ceasefire and withdrew its forces to a 115-kilometer-long strip of Syrian territory along its border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Continued Pressure and Recent Speculation

Despite the ceasefire, [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] has maintained pressure on the Kurds, regularly signaling the possibility of another full-scale invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. For instance, in late 2022, speculation grew after a major bomb attack in Istanbul was linked to the YPG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Many observers believe [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] has been waiting for the opportune moment to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The recent fall of the Assad regime is seen as potentially opening the way for a [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkish]] invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. With Russia's reduced presence and the new HTS administration in Damascus supported by pro-Turkish forces, [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | Ankara]] may now view this as the ideal time to move against the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Reports are already emerging that [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] and its allied proxies are preparing a major assault on Kurdish-held areas in northern and eastern Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes and Lack of External Support

A new [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkish]] invasion would pose a massive threat to Kurdish areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Although the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have combat experience against ISIS, they are spread thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] possesses air power and superior artillery, plus support from its Syrian proxy forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While Kurdish forces could offer stiff resistance, they would likely require external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Western Countries (United States)
Attention would turn to Western countries, especially the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Washington faces a delicate balancing act: while it has supported the Kurdish-led SDF against ISIS, [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] is a [[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | NATO]] ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Historically, the US has avoided such confrontations with [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | Ankara]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. It is highly doubtful the US would militarily aid the Kurdish areas against a [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkish]] attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The US response would likely focus on de-escalation, diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and calls for restraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Other Western states are also unlikely to engage or have the capacity to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Israel
Another possibility raised is that [[israeli_military_actions_and_their_impact_on_turkishisraeli_tensions | Israel]] might support the Kurds, potentially with air cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. However, this is also improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. While [[israeli_military_actions_and_their_impact_on_turkishisraeli_tensions | Israel]] has historically sympathized with the Kurds as a counterbalance to shared adversaries like Iran, Syria, and Islamist groups, and has voiced support for Kurdish aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, it would almost certainly stop short of direct military assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A direct military confrontation with [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] could escalate dangerously, and [[israeli_military_actions_and_their_impact_on_turkishisraeli_tensions | Israel]] would want to avoid straining relations with allies like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Any [[israeli_military_actions_and_their_impact_on_turkishisraeli_tensions | Israeli]] assistance would likely be focused and carefully calibrated, such as intelligence sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Iraqi Kurds
The only other likely source of support would be the Iraqi Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Despite shared ethnic and cultural ties, the KRG has been weakened recently and is on the verge of financial collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The KRG also maintains a complex relationship with [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Supporting Syrian Kurds, particularly the YPG due to its links with the PKK, could jeopardize these ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Therefore, while Iraqi Kurds might provide humanitarian assistance, significant military support to Syria's Kurds is unlikely from the KRG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Given these factors, [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | Ankara]] may well calculate that now is the ideal moment to strike against the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. While [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] might still back off under international pressure, a military offensive would almost certainly lead to a brutal conflict with many casualties, given past experiences where hundreds of thousands were killed, injured, and displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The new post-Assad era in Syria may not end the fighting but instead see the country enter a new, bloodier phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

In April 2023, [[recent_fighting_in_sudan_and_potential_new_civil_war | fierce fighting erupted in Sudan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, raising fears that the country had been [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | plunged into yet another civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Unlike [[historical_context_of_sudans_conflicts | previous conflicts that have plagued the country]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, this one is [[factions_within_sudans_military_and_power_struggles | centred on competing factions within the country's military]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The situation could have [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | far broader international implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Geographic and Economic Overview

The Republic of Sudan is located in Northeast Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34">[01:34]</a>. It is the world's 15th largest country and the third largest state in Africa, covering approximately 1.8 million square kilometres (720,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>. Sudan shares borders with:
*   Egypt to its north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>
*   The Red Sea and Eritrea to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">[01:50]</a>
*   Ethiopia and South Sudan to its south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53">[01:53]</a>
*   The Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56">[01:56]</a>

Its population is estimated to be around 46 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[02:00]</a>. While 97% of Sudanese adhere to Sunni Islam, the country is ethnically mixed, with 70% being Arab and other groups including the Fur, Baja, and Nubians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04">[02:04]</a>. Sudan is a member of the Arab League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10">[02:10]</a>.

Historically, the discovery of oil along the north-south boundary was a significant factor leading to the [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | Second Sudanese Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>. After South Sudan gained independence, the Sudanese government lost crucial oil revenues from the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45">[07:45]</a>.

## Strategic Importance

The current [[recent_fighting_in_sudan_and_potential_new_civil_war | fighting on the streets of Khartoum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23">[01:23]</a> has garnered significant international attention due to [[economic_and_strategic_interests_in_the_horn_of_africa | critical geopolitical and economic factors at play]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39">[12:39]</a> and [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | critical geopolitical and economic factors at play]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39">[12:39]</a>.

Despite its poverty and chronic instability, Sudan possesses mineral resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44">[12:44]</a>. It is considered an essential strategic gateway connecting the Middle East and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51">[12:51]</a>. Furthermore, Sudan's coastline along the Red Sea grants it control over one of the most crucial waterways in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55">[12:55]</a>.

The involvement of [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | different geopolitical actors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a> further adds to the situation's complexity. General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, commander of the Armed Forces, is regarded as being closer to the United States and has the support of neighbouring Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35">[10:35]</a>. In contrast, General Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), is seen as having close links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38">[10:38]</a>.

For these reasons, the United States, China, Russia, and the European Union are all closely monitoring the situation in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12">[13:12]</a>. The ongoing conflict marks the latest tragic chapter for a country that has been in a state of conflict for almost its entire [[historical_background_to_sudan_conflict | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25">[13:25]</a>, with the military maintaining a seemingly permanent place in the country's politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30">[13:30]</a>, leading to the disastrous consequences now observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36">[13:36]</a>.

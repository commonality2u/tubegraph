The disparity in global attention toward various conflicts is a frequently observed phenomenon in [[impact_on_international_relations | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Some conflicts garner widespread [[media_coverage_and_international_attention_on_conflicts | international attention]], while others remain largely overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Attention

Several factors determine whether a conflict receives significant global focus:
*   **Geopolitical Significance** A situation might gain attention if it touches on [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical factors]] or directly involves a great power or its close allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.
*   **Economic Impact** Conflicts that have [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict | economic effects]], such as disrupting trade routes or access to vital resources, tend to attract more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.
*   **Risk of Expansion** A conflict may also receive focus if it threatens to escalate regionally or internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
*   **Media and Policy Priorities** [[media_coverage_and_international_attention_on_conflicts | Media and policy priorities]] play a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. Wars in remote or less strategically significant areas often receive less attention, even if their impact is more catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

## The Case of Sudan: A "Forgotten War"

While [[media_coverage_and_international_attention_on_conflicts | international attention]] is heavily concentrated on conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, fears are escalating regarding the deteriorating situation in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite a fierce civil war that dramatically escalated over the past year, leading to Sudan becoming the world's worst humanitarian crisis, it is frequently referred to as a "forgotten war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

### Initial Media Coverage and Decline

The outbreak of the civil war in Sudan initially received significant [[media_coverage_and_international_attention_on_conflicts | media coverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>, particularly due to the large number of foreigners caught in the escalating situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This necessitated urgent evacuation efforts by numerous countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:20">[09:09:20]</a>.

Broader [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | political and strategic factors]] also contributed to this initial attention:
*   Sudan's strategic location on the Red Sea, a vital waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:07">[09:27:07]</a>.
*   Its traditional role as a conduit between North and Sub-Saharan Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   The links between the warring factions and global powers (Russia and the West) added an [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | international policy]] and [[media_coverage_and_international_attention_on_conflicts | media dimension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:13">[09:39:13]</a>.

However, once foreign nationals were evacuated, [[media_coverage_and_international_attention_on_conflicts | news coverage]] of the conflict quickly dwindled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:18">[10:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:05">[10:06:05]</a>. Policy attention shifted, especially following the surge in Middle East violence in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:15">[10:11:15]</a>.

### Worsening Crisis Amid Lack of Attention

Despite the reduced international focus, the situation on the ground in Sudan has continued to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:08">[10:23:08]</a>. The fighting has spread beyond the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>, and calls for a ceasefire during Ramadan have been unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:02">[10:40:02]</a>. The conflict has also become a proxy war involving the Russian Wagner Group supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Ukrainian commandos supporting the Sudanese Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:32">[10:59:32]</a>.

The broader humanitarian effects are a major concern:
*   At least 14,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:30">[11:13:30]</a>.
*   Sudan now has the highest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) globally, estimated at 6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   An additional 1.7 million people have become refugees in neighboring states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
*   Severe food shortages have left the country on the brink of starvation, with an estimated 25 million people (half the population) requiring life-saving assistance, including 14 million children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
*   Attacks on Red Sea shipping by Houthi forces have severely limited food imports to Port Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   The wider region has also faced lingering food shortages from recent severe famines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   There are growing fears about horrific acts of violence in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

Despite the UN calling for $4.1 billion US to address the crisis, it has been "extraordinarily difficult" to get the international community to focus on Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This highlights a tragic reality where major unfolding disasters in Africa receive limited attention when global focus remains on other conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

[[Ethiopia and Somalias diplomatic relations | Relations between Ethiopia and Somalia]] have been marked by decades of [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions]] and even bitter conflict [00:00:04]. These problematic relations have persisted for over 60 years, at times escalating to war and invasion [00:01:31].

## Geographic and Demographic Context

The [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] and the Republic of Somalia are neighboring countries in East Africa [00:01:43]. Ethiopia is landlocked and has a highly mixed population of over 80 distinct [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | ethnic groups]], including Oromos, Amhara, Tigrayans, and a significant Somali community in its eastern region [00:01:49]. Somalia, in contrast, is one of the least ethnically diverse countries on the continent, with almost all inhabitants being ethnic Somalis [00:02:03]. However, Somali society is divided by a complex network of clan affiliations [00:02:12]. Additionally, the northern region of Somaliland broke away from Somalia in the early 1990s [00:02:18].

## Historical Roots of Conflict

While both Ethiopia and Somalia possess long histories, the genesis of their modern tensions largely traces back to the late 19th century during the European colonization of Africa [00:02:25]. Ethiopia, then known as Abyssinia, was never formally conquered [00:02:37]. However, the Somali-inhabited coastal lands were divided among French, British, and Italian colonial powers [00:02:43]. In 1887, the Ethiopian Empire gained control of the predominantly [[historical_background_of_the_somali_region | Somali-inhabited Ogaden region]], a move which Britain accepted a decade later [00:02:48].

### Post-Decolonization and the "Greater Somalia" Ambition

In 1960, as decolonization accelerated, British and Italian Somaliland united to form the new independent state of the Somali Republic [00:02:59]. From its inception, [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | relations between the new country and neighboring Ethiopia]] were strained [00:03:10]. Somali nationalists pursued the goal of uniting all Somali-inhabited areas into a single "Greater Somalia" [00:03:12]. This ambition encompassed French-held territory (which later became Djibouti), parts of Kenya, and crucially, the Ogaden region within Ethiopia [00:03:22].

## The Ogaden War (1977-1978)

Tensions dramatically escalated in 1969 following a Marxist army officer, General Muhammad Siad Barre, seizing power in Somalia [00:03:32]. Promising to unite all Somali territories, Siad Barre began providing political and military support to Somali insurgents in the Ogaden [00:03:43]. Somalia saw an opportunity to act after the overthrow of Ethiopia's pro-Western Emperor Haile Selassie [00:03:51]. In July 1977, Somalia, supported by Somali insurgents, launched an invasion [00:03:59].

Initially, Somali forces made substantial gains [00:04:05]. However, the situation dramatically shifted when the Soviet Union withdrew its support for Siad Barre and instead backed the new communist military regime in Ethiopia [00:04:11]. Consequently, by March 1978, Ethiopian forces had retaken the Ogaden, forcing Somali troops into a humiliating withdrawal [00:04:18].

### Aftermath of the Ogaden War

The Ogaden War marked a significant turning point in [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | relations between Ethiopia and Somalia]] [00:04:29]. While [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions persisted throughout the 1980s]], direct conflict evolved into indirect confrontation, with both countries supporting rebel groups on each other's territory [00:04:36]. The war had broader implications: Soviet-backed Ethiopia emerged as a regional power, while the defeat undermined Siad Barre, leading him to shift allegiance to the West [00:04:50].

## Post-Cold War Developments and Renewed Tensions

The end of the Cold War fundamentally altered the political landscape for both nations [00:04:59].

### Ethiopia's Landlocked Status

In Ethiopia, the loss of Soviet support led to the overthrow of the military regime by a coalition of [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | ethnic rebel groups]] [00:05:08]. As part of this change, Ethiopia accepted Eritrea's independence in 1993 [00:05:16]. This had profound [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_ethiopia_eritrea_dynamics | effects]], as Ethiopia subsequently lost direct access to the Red Sea and became a landlocked country [00:05:21].

### Somalia's Collapse and Somaliland's Secession

In January 1991, Siad Barre was finally overthrown in Somalia [00:05:30]. Instead of ushering in stability, Somalia descended into anarchy and chaos due to the collapse of central government authority [00:05:36]. Amidst this civil war, the northern area, formerly British Somaliland, seized the opportunity to break away, declaring independence as the Republic of Somaliland on May 18, 1991 [00:05:46].

For decades, Somaliland became an island of stability while the rest of Somalia collapsed [00:06:01]. However, despite its stability, the international community largely ignored Somaliland's consistent calls for recognition [00:06:10]. The general view was that African states should lead in recognizing it first [00:06:20].

### Ethiopia's Engagement in Somalia

Ethiopia closely monitored developments in Somalia, fearing broader regional instability [00:06:30]. This concern culminated in 2006 when Ethiopia launched a full-scale military invasion to drive out an Islamist group that had taken control of Mogadishu, the Somali capital [00:06:39]. Subsequently, Ethiopia supported Somalia's gradual efforts to rebuild under a federal government [00:06:51]. Ethiopia played a central role in an African Union peacekeeping mission to Somalia and assisted with efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, another Islamist insurgency [00:06:56].

By 2018, [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | relations between Ethiopia and Somalia]] were strengthening, particularly with the rise of reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali in Ethiopia, who promised greater regional and international cooperation [00:07:10]. As Ethiopia's status grew as an assertive economic and political actor, the issue of sea access, lost with Eritrea's independence, once again became a priority [00:07:24]. This quest for sea access ultimately sparked renewed [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions with Somalia]] [00:07:37].

## The 2024 Somaliland Port Deal and Aftermath

On January 1, 2024, Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in Addis Ababa [00:07:55]. Under the terms of this deal, Ethiopia would recognize Somaliland in exchange for a long-term lease over a port facility on the Red Sea, intended for both commercial and military purposes [00:08:07].

This announcement was met with jubilation in Somaliland, seen by many as a crucial breakthrough for broader international recognition [00:08:18]. However, it immediately caused an outcry in Mogadishu [00:08:34]. The Somali government denounced the deal as a fundamental infringement of its territorial integrity and sovereignty [00:08:39]. In response, Somalia expelled the Ethiopian ambassador and complained to the UN Security Council [00:08:48].

Tensions continued to escalate, with Somalia seeking African and international support for its position, highlighting how the Ethiopian decision would undermine its stability and reconstruction efforts [00:08:53]. Mogadishu even suggested military action and began building closer defense and security relationships, including with Egypt, which has its own long-standing dispute with Ethiopia [00:09:11]. Ethiopia remained undeterred, reaffirming its commitment to the port deal a few months later [00:09:24].

### Turkish Mediation

As [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | relations steadily deteriorated]] and confrontation seemed imminent, Turkey intervened to de-escalate the situation [00:09:33]. Following talks in Ankara mediated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the two sides issued a joint declaration on December 11, 2024 [00:09:42]. They agreed to launch technical talks by February 2025 and aim for a final agreement within four months [00:09:53]. The agreement acknowledges Ethiopia's potential benefits from assured sea access and commits to a settlement that would allow Ethiopia "reliable, secure, and sustained access to the sea under Somalia’s sovereign authority" [00:10:06].

### Implications

A final agreement, if reached, would have profound implications for the [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | Horn of Africa]], a region long prone to conflict and instability [00:10:23]. Such a settlement could foster better economic and political relations and lay foundations for greater security cooperation against extremism and other regional crises [00:10:36]. The declaration has been widely welcomed internationally [00:10:49]. For Turkey, the successful mediation highlights its growing influence as a political and diplomatic actor in Africa [00:11:01]. The clear loser in this outcome, however, is Somaliland, whose hopes for Ethiopian recognition and broader international acceptance appear premature [00:11:23].

Recent months have seen widespread anti-government demonstrations in Georgia, spurred by opposition to a new law that critics argue stifles democracy and indicates a drift towards Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This occurs despite parts of Georgia being under Russian occupation and the Georgian government openly supporting European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

Georgia is situated in the Caucasus region, bordered by Russia to the north, Azerbaijan to the southeast, and Armenia and Turkey to the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. To its west, it lies on the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The country spans approximately 70,000 square kilometers (27,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. While two of its regions, [[abkhazias_historical_relationship_with_russia | Abkhazia]] and [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]], have unilaterally declared independence, making up about 20% of the country's territory, they are recognized only by Russia and a few other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Georgia's population is around 3.7 million, with ethnic Georgians comprising nearly 90%, followed mainly by Azeris and Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The country is predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Historical Context of [[georgias_history_with_russia_and_territorial_conflicts | Relations with Russia]]

Georgia boasts a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. A distinct Georgian identity emerged over 2,000 years ago, and a unified kingdom flourished during the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This golden age ended with the Mongol invasions in the 13th century, after which the kingdom fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Facing pressure from the Ottoman and Safavid empires, one Georgian kingdom sought protection from Imperial Russia in 1783 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Within 30 years, this kingdom was annexed, and by the mid-19th century, all Georgian people were under Russian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

As Tsarist Russia collapsed in 1917, Georgians, Armenians, and Azerbaijanis formed the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Georgia declared its independence as the Democratic Republic of Georgia on May 26, 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, this lasted only three years, as the Red Army invaded in February 1921, incorporating Georgia into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic for the next 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Post-Soviet Independence and Early Challenges

Georgia declared independence on April 9, 1991, following nationalist protests in 1989, and formally gained statehood with the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. On July 31, 1992, Georgia was admitted to the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Initially, it joined the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

Georgia faced immediate challenges, including a civil war and attempts by [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] and [[abkhazias_historical_relationship_with_russia | Abkhazia]] to break away, leading to violent clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These conflicts concluded with [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Kremlin-brokered ceasefires]] policed by Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Despite these strains, President Eduard Shevardnadze, a pro-Western figure, attempted to maintain working ties with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### The Rose Revolution and Pro-Western Orientation

In 2003, Shevardnadze was peacefully overthrown by the Rose Revolution due to unresolved issues with breakaway territories, economic problems, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Mikheil Saakashvili, a Western-educated lawyer, became president, vowing major reforms and a closer alignment with the European Union and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This shift led to a sharp deterioration in relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### The 2008 War and its Impact

In August 2008, war erupted between Georgia and Russia, resulting in a decisive Russian victory within days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Russia subsequently recognized [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] and [[abkhazias_historical_relationship_with_abkhazia | Abkhazia]] as independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This conflict marked a decisive break, with Tbilisi cutting diplomatic ties to Moscow and withdrawing from the CIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Saakashvili's standing was severely damaged, and his administration faced accusations of authoritarianism and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Georgian Dream and a More Conciliatory Approach

In 2012, Saakashvili's party was defeated by the Georgian Dream coalition, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in post-Soviet Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Despite Ivanishvili's background, the new government maintained Georgia's pro-Western orientation, signing an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014 and opening a joint training center with NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

However, in contrast to the previous administration, Georgian Dream adopted a more conciliatory approach towards Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Efforts began to normalize relations by focusing on trade, travel, and humanitarian cooperation, while avoiding steps that would inflame tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. For instance, while Georgia condemned Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, it refused to impose sanctions, arguing for a pragmatic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Growing Concerns and Political Backsliding

The opposition increasingly accused the Georgian Dream government of pro-Russian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Mass demonstrations erupted in June 2019 following a Russian lawmaker's visit to the Georgian Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Observers also noted parallels with political developments in Russia, particularly concerns about democratic backsliding, including judicial independence and media freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This was further fueled by growing [[impact_of_foreign_influence_and_domestic_legislation_on_georgias_foreign_policy | Russian disinformation]] aimed at encouraging extremism and anti-Western messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### The "Foreign Influence" Law and EU Candidacy

The issue came to a head with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Georgians largely supported Ukraine, but the government maintained its balanced position, condemning the attack and voting for UN resolutions against Moscow, yet still refusing to impose sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Georgia applied to join the EU alongside Moldova and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, unlike the others, Georgia was given 12 priorities to address, including democratic reforms, rule of law, and countering foreign disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Concern grew when the government introduced a controversial "foreign influence" law, requiring organizations receiving over 20% of their income from external sources to register as agents of foreign influence, mirroring similar Russian legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This law was initially dropped due to internal opposition and criticism from the EU and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. In December 2023, Georgia was formally granted EU candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

However, just months later, the government reintroduced the "foreign agents" legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Despite mass demonstrations and strong international criticism, the government refused to back down, overriding a presidential veto and passing the law on May 28, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Alignment and Future Prospects

While the government denies accusations of being under Moscow's influence, its rhetoric has taken a distinctly pro-Russian turn, incorporating conspiracy theories and Kremlin disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. For example, Ivanishvili has accused a "Global War Party" of instigating the conflict in Ukraine and forcing Georgia and Russia to war in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

The current situation in Georgia is highly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. While a drift towards Moscow is possible, a more immediate explanation is the government's attempt to strengthen its position before parliamentary elections later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This includes hindering the opposition and shoring up its base with measures like new anti-LGBT legislation, which appeals to older, socially conservative voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

This strategy runs counter to the demands of Georgia's Western partners and the high public support for EU membership (around 80%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Even if the government is not overtly pro-Russian, its pushback against the EU for internal survival provides Moscow with an opportunity to exert influence, as Russia does not condition its support on the rule of law or democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This mirrors situations like [[russian_influence_and_involvement_in_gagauzia | Moldova]], where pro-Russian support exists despite Russian occupation of territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

Russia's aim may not be a complete Georgian realignment, but rather to divide society and reduce Western influence and support for Euro-Atlantic integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. In this sense, the ultimate aims of Russia and the Georgian Dream government appear to be steadily converging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

As Georgia approaches pivotal elections, President Salome Zourabichvili is leading efforts to challenge the government and return Georgia to a European path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The coming months will likely determine Georgia's future orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

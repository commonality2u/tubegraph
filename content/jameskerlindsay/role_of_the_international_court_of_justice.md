The International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, Netherlands, is the principal legal body of the United Nations (UN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. It consists of 15 judges, each elected for nine-year terms by the UN General Assembly and the Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Mandate and Functions

The ICJ serves two primary purposes:
1.  **Advisory Opinions** It provides legal advice to the United Nations, including the General Assembly, the Security Council, the UN Secretariat, and specialized UN agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Dispute Resolution** The Court rules on issues brought before it by UN member states that accept its jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. These cases frequently involve [[role_of_international_law_in_border_conflicts | border disputes]] and acts of aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. It can also hear cases related to the Genocide Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Distinction from Other Courts

It is important to note that the ICJ is not a criminal court; its jurisdiction is solely concerned with states' responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. The task of [[history_of_international_prosecution_of_leaders | holding individuals accountable]] for genocide falls to national courts, specialized international courts, or the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is a separate body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## The Genocide Convention and ICJ Jurisdiction

The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1948, and entering into force three years later, defines genocide as acts intended to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

Beyond direct killing, genocide can also include:
*   Causing serious bodily or mental harm to group members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   Deliberately inflicting conditions intended to lead to the group's destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   Measures to prevent births within the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

The Convention also criminalizes conspiracy, direct and public incitement, attempts, and complicity in genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Article IX of the Convention states that disputes relating to the Convention, including state responsibility for genocide, should be submitted to the ICJ at the request of any party to the dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Importantly, any of the 153 states that have ratified the Convention can bring a case, regardless of direct involvement or special interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

Previous and ongoing cases before the ICJ involving the Genocide Convention include:
*   Ukraine against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   The Gambia against Myanmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   Serbia and Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   Bosnia and Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## South Africa v. Israel: Genocide Case

On January 11, 2024, the ICJ began hearings on South Africa's claim that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This case has sharply divided international opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Background to the Case

The case stems from the conflict that began in late 2023, following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths and thousands wounded, with hundreds taken prisoner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Israel responded with a massive air operation and ground invasion of Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This operation has reportedly killed at least 23,000 Palestinians, including over 7,000 children, and displaced almost 2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. A total blockade on Gaza has also led to severe shortages of food, medical supplies, and disrupted essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

The situation in Gaza has been described as a "humanitarian catastrophe" by the UN Secretary-General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Critics argue that Israel's actions have gone beyond legitimate self-defense and constitute a deliberate policy to destroy the Palestinian people in the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### South Africa's Allegations

Building on its historical support for Palestinians, rooted in links between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and South Africa's African National Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, South Africa initiated proceedings against Israel under the Genocide Convention on December 29, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. South Africa requested the Court to consider provisional measuresâ€”immediate steps to halt actions that might amount to genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

South Africa argued that Israel's government and military acts were "intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial, and ethnical group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. During the January 11 hearing, South Africa highlighted that Israel's military operations had led to the deaths of approximately 1% of Gaza's Palestinian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. They contended that the operation's complete disregard for civilian life amounted to a deliberate policy of extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Furthermore, South Africa presented statements by Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and media figures as evidence of incitement to genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, concluding that Israel demonstrated a "chilling and incontrovertible intent to commit genocide in Gaza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

### Israel's Response

On January 12, Israel categorically rejected the accusations of genocide, calling South Africa's claims a "profoundly distorted view of the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. Israel asserted that its invasion of Gaza was a legitimate act of self-defense following Hamas's October attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. It denied that its leaders incited genocide, claiming comments were taken out of context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

Israel argued that many deaths and injuries were caused by Hamas, which used civilian buildings like hospitals and schools for military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, and laid mines and booby traps across Gaza, causing widespread civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The Israeli legal team further argued that Hamas's ideology, which aims for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people, makes *Hamas* the party guilty of genocide, not Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

### Court Proceedings and Potential Outcomes

The case involves two distinct phases:

1.  **Provisional Measures:** The Court will decide whether Israeli actions might contravene the Convention and may issue an order outlining steps Israel must take to prevent violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Given the urgency, a ruling on provisional measures is expected within a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Main Ruling:** The primary ruling on whether Israel has violated the Genocide Convention is not expected for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

The ICJ has no direct enforcement powers, but its rulings carry significant moral authority and could open the way for further action at the United Nations, including resolutions in the Security Council or General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

Israel's government is expected to largely ignore any provisional measures that limit its operations in Gaza, arguing it has a duty to continue its campaign against Hamas until total victory and security are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Legal analysts suggest that any order for provisional measures could offer early indications of the Court's direction on the central question of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

For the main ruling, Israel appears to be preparing a defense strategy that involves questioning the Court's credibility and claiming any unfavorable decision is politically motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Netanyahu, has openly criticized the Court, pointing to the origin of some judges and potential political pressures on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

### Implications of Rulings

If the ICJ rules against Israel, it would suffer colossal damage to its international reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. The [[political_implications_of_the_icj_rulings | implications]] for Israel, a country forged by genocide, would be profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

A ruling against Israel would also pose a significant challenge for its supporting countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. They would face a dilemma: either condemn Israel and support measures against it, or reject the Court's decision as politically motivated, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the ICJ and [[international_legal_proceedings_from_the_conflict | international law]] at a time of unprecedented challenge to the established international order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

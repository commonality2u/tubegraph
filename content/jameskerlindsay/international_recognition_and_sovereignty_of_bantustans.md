During the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid era]], South Africa established four nominally independent states known as Bantustans or homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These entities were designed to perpetuate the system of racial segregation and white minority rule. Despite their declared independence, the international community never recognized these so-called states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This unique situation raised fundamental questions about statehood and [[sovereignty_territorial_integrity_and_political_independence | sovereignty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Sovereignty and the Creation of New States

Traditionally, it has been a central tenet of [[sovereignty_territorial_integrity_and_political_independence | sovereignty]] that states can determine their own borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The general thinking was that a state could freely give away territory or permit it to become a separate sovereign and independent country, provided this was done through constitutional procedures and not through coercion or force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.

However, the Bantustans presented a notable exception where the international community decided a country was *not* permitted to declare parts of its territory independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Bantustans

The term "Bantustan" is a hybrid word, combining "Bantu" (a leading language group in South Africa) with "-stan" (a suffix often used to designate countries in Central Asia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. These homelands were deliberately conceived to reinforce the institutionalized racism of the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

The history of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] policies leading to the Bantustans includes:
*   **Population Registration Act (1950):** Required all South Africans to be defined as Black, White, or Coloured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Group Areas Act (1950):** Established separate residential and business areas for different races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, leading to the forced eviction of millions of black South Africans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Bantu Authorities Act (1951):** Granted authority to tribal leaders and councils within traditional homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act (1959):** Laid the groundwork for possible self-rule in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Homeland Citizenship Act (1970):** Mandated that every Black South African become a citizen of one of the homelands, regardless of their actual residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Bantu Homelands Constitution Act (1971):** Empowered the government to grant "independence" to any of the homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

The first self-governing Bantustan was Transkei in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Ultimately, 10 Bantustans were designated in South Africa, with another 10 in Southwest Africa (now Namibia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

### The Independent Bantustans (TBVC States)

Despite significant [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | international condemnation]], South Africa proceeded with declaring four Bantustans "independent":
*   **Republic of Transkei:** Declared independent on October 26, 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This act immediately rendered every black South African assigned Transkei citizenship a foreigner in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Bophutatswana:** Declared independent in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. It was composed of disparate territories across northern South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Venda:** Declared independent in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Ciskei:** Declared independent in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

These four entities became known as the "TBVC States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

## International Rejection of Recognition

The creation of the self-governing Bantustans sparked an international outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   In November 1971, the UN General Assembly condemned their creation and the forced relocation of people, arguing that these policies were designed to weaken the rights of Black Africans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   Subsequent General Assembly resolutions called upon all governments and organizations not to deal with any Bantustan institutions or accord them any form of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   Following Transkei's declaration of independence, the General Assembly and Security Council reiterated calls for UN members not to recognize them as states or have dealings with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, no UN member ever recognized the TBVC States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Even neighboring Lesotho resisted pressure from South Africa to recognize Transkei, a stance praised by the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

The [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | international condemnation]] of the Bantustans' recognition was not based on their capacity to be states, but rather because their independence was viewed as a cynical move to support a racist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. Their economic and political reliance on South Africa also questioned their true independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Ultimately, their existence emanated from a desire to support the racist policy of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]], which was judged to be a crime against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

## Demise and Reintegration

[[The end of apartheid and reintegration of Bantustans | The end of apartheid]] brought about the demise of the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. Following decades of pressure and a tightening sanctions regime, the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] system began to crumble in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

*   In 1990, the 10 self-governing Bantustans in Southwest Africa disappeared when South Africa withdrew, and Namibia became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
*   As South Africa moved towards a post-[[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] era, the UN General Assembly called for the peaceful reincorporation of the homelands into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   While Transkei and Venda accepted reintegration, Ciskei and Bophutatswana initially resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
*   A crisis in Bophutatswana, involving a strike and military mutiny, led to its president's flight and the formal appointment of an interim administrator by the South African government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Ciskei subsequently accepted reincorporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   On April 27, 1994, the first day of South Africa's interim constitution, the legislation that created all Bantustans—both the four nominally independent ones and the six others—was repealed by the South African Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. The new constitutional order applied to all parts of the country, and South Africa became a united state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

## A Unique Anomaly in International Relations

The Bantustans represent a fascinating anomaly in modern [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. They are the only example of a country granting independence to part of its territory, only for that independence to be rejected by the wider international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. This rejection underscored the principle that acts designed to thwart human rights and [[selfdetermination_and_sovereignty_issues | self-determination]] of a majority population, particularly in support of a system deemed a crime against humanity, would not be legitimized through international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

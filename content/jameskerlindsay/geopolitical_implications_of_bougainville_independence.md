Creating a new state is a complex process, and most existing states strongly resist any attempts by a region to secede, often due to concerns over precedent, historical or cultural significance, or strategic factors such as access to the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The question remains whether [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | outside actors]] will be willing to pressure the Papuan Government to honor its commitments regarding Bougainville's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### China's Growing Influence

In recent years, China has actively sought to expand its regional influence by courting [[history_and_geopolitical_context_of_pacific_islands | Pacific states]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Many suspect that an independent Bougainville could fall into China's orbit, especially since Beijing has indicated a willingness to invest in the territory to access its valuable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Relations with the US and Australia

While Papua New Guinea has signed economic agreements with China, it has also been building defense cooperation with the United States and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This dynamic could influence the willingness of the US and Australia to intervene on Bougainville's behalf if Papua New Guinea delays statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Notably, both Washington and Canberra have avoided taking a definitive stance in favor of independence, instead emphasizing long-term stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

Ultimately, the combination of [[economic_and_resource_factors_in_bougainville | economic]] considerations and [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical]] dynamics will likely determine whether Bougainville eventually becomes a new member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

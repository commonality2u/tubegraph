The [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Biafran War]], also known as the [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigerian Civil War]], was one of the most brutal conflicts of modern times, leading to over a million deaths and millions more displaced people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This conflict significantly shaped thinking on secession and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While now largely forgotten, it was considered the humanitarian tragedy of its era when it took place in the late 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The war's roots can be traced back to [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria's]] colonial formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The international community's deep aversion to secession, particularly unilateral secession, largely evolved after 1945 and the founding of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Contemporary attitudes towards secession can be traced to two specific cases of separatism in Africa in the 1960s: Katanga's attempt to break away from the [[history_of_colonialism_in_the_congo_and_surrounding_regions | Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Biafran War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These cases cemented the idea that the principle of respecting the territorial integrity of states applied not only to external threats but also to internal secession attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria's]] Geographical and Ethnic Landscape
[[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] is located in West Africa and covers approximately 910,000 square kilometers, making it the 31st largest of the 193 United Nations member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. With an estimated population of 200 million, it is the most populous country in Africa and seventh globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The country is extremely diverse, comprising over 250 different ethno-linguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The three main groups are:
*   **Hausa and Fulani:** Representing about 30% of the population, primarily located in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Yoruba:** Making up around 20% of the population, from the southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Igbo:** Representing 20% of the population, from the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## The European Colonial Scramble and [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria's]] Formation
The colonial [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | history of Nigeria]] began in the mid-19th century amidst the European colonial scramble for Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **1851:** British forces captured the coastal port of Lagos, which was formally annexed in 1865 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **1885:** Britain acquired additional territories in the region under the Berlin Conference, which formalized European colonial holdings in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **1900:** These territories formally became the Southern [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigerian]] Protectorate and the Northern [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigerian]] Protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **1914:** Facing a budget deficit in the Northern Protectorate, the two protectorates were merged to form the Colony and Protectorate of [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This step, taken for economic reasons, created an entity fundamentally at odds with itself and would have profound implications for the country's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Decolonisation and Post-Independence Tensions
Following World War II and the onset of decolonisation, Britain prepared for its departure from [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **1954:** As [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] moved towards independence, it was reconstituted as the Federation of [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Federal Structure:** This federation was composed of three regions broadly mapping onto the main ethnic groups: the Hausa-Fulani Northern [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]], the Igbo Eastern [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]], and the Yoruba Western [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **1960:** On October 1, [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] formally gained independence and soon after joined the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The tensions between north and south quickly escalated in the political arena after independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **1964:** The first post-independence general election was marred by serious political violence and highly disputed results, with the Northern People's Congress claiming victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **1965-1966:** Tensions grew, culminating in an attempted coup on January 15, 1966, led by junior military officers from the southern Igbo ethnic group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This coup resulted in the assassination of 22 senior political and military figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Though quickly defeated, its effects were widely felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **July 1966:** Another coup saw northern army officers take control of the country, executing several hundred southerners, mostly ethnic Igbo, in reprisal for the earlier attempted coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Mass Exodus:** Attacks on Igbo living in the north increased, with an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people murdered, sparking a mass exodus of up to 2 million Igbo who fled south to the safety of the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## The Road to the [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Biafran War]]
With the country in crisis and talk of eastern secession growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>:
*   **January 1967:** The British Government organized a peace conference in Ghana between [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigerian]] leader Colonel Yakubu Gowon and Eastern Province leader Colonel Odomegwu Ojukwu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The sides seemed to reach an agreement, the Aburi Accord, but a dispute soon arose over its interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **May 1967:** In an attempt to weaken the East, which was also a center of the country's oil production, the central government announced that the country would be reconstituted into 12 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **May 30, 1967:** Ojukwu responded by unilaterally declaring independence, formally proclaiming the creation of the Republic of Biafra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **July 6, 1967:** Just over a month later, the federal government declared war on the breakaway province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The subsequent [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Biafran War]] lasted three years and resulted in an estimated over a million deaths from fighting, famine, and illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigerian]] army made significant headway, aided by non-Igbo areas in the East siding with the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. By May 1968, the government took control of Port Harcourt, imposing a blockade on Biafra, which led to a famine that killed well over a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The war officially ended on January 15, 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

In the years since, [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] has deliberately tried to forget about its civil war, although pro-Biafran sentiment still exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Biafran War]] served to cement the international idea that states should not recognize unilateral secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. African states, many of whom had recently gained independence within diverse colonial borders, viewed Biafra's secession as an existential threat to their own territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The Organization of African Unity (now the African Union) played a key role in rallying support for [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

The British decision in the early 20th century to merge the two [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | Nigerian]] protectorates, taken for economic reasons, created an entity that was fundamentally at odds with itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This decision had dramatic and tragic consequences following the country's independence, leading to mass killings and one of modern Africa's most significant wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

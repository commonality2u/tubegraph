Iraqi Kurdistan, officially known as the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI), has long been considered a de facto state with many features and functions of a country, including democratic government institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Despite its progress towards statehood, the region now faces significant internal divisions that contribute to its current instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Entrenched Divisions within the Kurdish Population
Matters in Iraqi Kurdistan are complicated by entrenched divisions within its Kurdish population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This population is primarily split into two main political factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>:

*   **Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP)**: This party currently holds the presidency and controls the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. It is the largest party in the Kurdish Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
*   **Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)**: The PUK is the KDP's main rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a> and has traditionally held the Iraqi Federal presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

These two parties have been long-standing rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. The PUK has increasingly sought support from Iraq's Arab community and from Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, which has extended Baghdad and Tehran's political and strategic influence into the Kurdish area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Other Contributing Factors
Beyond the political factionalism, other issues are also destabilizing the region:
*   **Corruption**: Concerns about widespread corruption are a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.
*   **Human Rights**: There are reports of a declining human rights situation, which is particularly concerning given that Iraqi Kurdistan was previously considered more democratic and open than its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

These internal issues, combined with growing pressure from the Iraqi central government and neighboring Iran, contribute to the region's increasing instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This complex situation led the leader of the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Kurdish Regional Government]] to reportedly send a letter to US President Biden in September 2023, warning that the region was on the verge of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Prime Minister Masrour Barzani allegedly claimed that the crisis could lead to the collapse of Kurdistan and even the Iraqi federal system established after 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] A turning point
> Iraqi Kurdistan, once seen as a future country in waiting, now faces unprecedented domestic and regional challenges that threaten its very existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The internal divisions, coupled with external pressures, mean its days as a "country-in-waiting" may have ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

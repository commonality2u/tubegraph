The Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been described as one of the world's most unlikely conflict zones, transitioning from a vibrant holiday destination to a site of brutal fighting in the 1960s and 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It remains one of the most entrenched [[ethnic_conflict_in_cyprus | ethnic conflicts]] in international relations, hosting the longest-running major [[United Nations peacekeeping in Cyprus | United Nations]] peacemaking and peacekeeping mission globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. After almost 60 years of efforts, many question whether [[prospects_for_reunification_of_cyprus | Cyprus can still be solved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The Republic of Cyprus, though the only internationally recognized state, is divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), recognized only by Turkey, occupies about 36-37% of the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## [[historical_background_of_cyprus_conflict | Historical Background]] of Governance Issues

The modern [[Cyprus Dispute and its Impact | Cyprus dispute]] stems from its complex [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | historical context]]. After centuries of various foreign rulers, including Egyptian, Persian, Roman, Arab, Byzantine, Crusader, and Venetian, the island was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1571, leading to the arrival of the first Turkish inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. In 1878, administrative control passed to Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

From the start of British rule, the majority Greek Christian inhabitants called for "enosis" (union) with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This ambition persisted even after Cyprus became a British Crown Colony in 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. In 1955, Greek Cypriots launched an armed campaign for enosis, which in turn spurred Turkish Cypriot calls for "taksim" (partition) between Greece and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Post-Independence Power-Sharing

In early 1959, Greece and Turkey reached a compromise: Cyprus would become an independent state with a power-sharing arrangement between the two communities, guaranteed by Greece, Turkey, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The Republic of Cyprus was formally established on August 16, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

However, tensions remained. Many Greek Cypriots resented being denied union with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The power-sharing system quickly came under strain due to issues such as local government organization and the division of the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This culminated in fighting in December 1963 after Turkey rejected Greek Cypriot constitutional reform proposals, leading to the collapse of the joint government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

Although a [[United Nations peacekeeping in Cyprus | UN peacekeeping force]] was established in March 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, UN-led efforts for a political agreement failed for the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. In July 1974, a Greek military regime's attempt to overthrow the Cypriot government to secure enosis prompted Turkey to invade, resulting in the displacement of approximately 200,000 Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the division of the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

In 1977, both sides agreed that any solution would be based on a bizonal, bicommunal federal arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Despite this, Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence in November 1983, a move condemned by the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Talks throughout the 1980s and 90s remained deadlocked, largely due to the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leadership, backed by Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

## Contemporary Governance Challenges

Despite numerous efforts, including a major UN initiative in 2004 that put forward a reunification plan (rejected by Greek Cypriots in a referendum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>, a breakthrough remains elusive. The most recent major initiative in 2017 also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Today, almost 60 years after the first fighting, many observers believe a settlement is all but impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

### Key Points of Difference

Three key points of difference hinder a political settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>:

1.  **Governance**: This concerns the structure of the federal state and how communities will be represented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Turkish Cypriot perspective**: They insist on political equality, ensuring they cannot be sidelined by the majority Greek Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Greek Cypriot perspective**: They insist any new state must be functional, avoiding a "tyranny of the minority" Turkish Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. They also want assurances that Turkish Cypriots cannot break away again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

2.  **Territory and Property**: While approximately 36-37% of the island is currently under Turkish Cypriot control, observers believe this would need to be reduced to 25-29% in a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Questions also remain about the return of Greek Cypriot property in areas remaining under Turkish Cypriot control, or compensation for those unable/unwilling to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

3.  **Security**: This is particularly sensitive for Greek Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. The 1960 settlement allowed Greece and Turkey to station troops and intervene in constitutional crises, as occurred in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Greek Cypriot position**: They are adamant that these provisions must be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Turkish Cypriot position**: They view the presence of Turkish troops and the right of intervention as essential guarantees of their security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

Additional issues include the fate of Turkish settlers, the nature of a future peacekeeping force, and transitional arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## Lack of Political Will

Despite a theoretical understanding of what a settlement would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, the true impediment is a lack of political will in both communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

### Greek Cypriot Attitudes

Greek Cypriot attitudes are complex:
*   Some favor a federal agreement and reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
*   Hardline nationalists oppose any federal agreement, viewing Cyprus as Greek and Turkish Cypriots as unwanted newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.
*   Many fear reunification would be too risky, potentially leading to a return to political deadlock and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   There's a belief that it's better to prevent talks from reaching another referendum to avoid another rejection, as this might lead the world to give up on a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

### Turkish Cypriot Attitudes

While generally seen as more likely to favor reunification, this cannot be taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   Hardliners steadfastly oppose reunification, preferring isolation within their unrecognised state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.
*   Even moderates, while seeing potential advantages of reunification, may demand too much or fail to be realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   Ankara's growing control over the north is a significant factor, with fears that Turkey might attempt to annex the north, ending any hope of reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

### Generational Divide

Counterintuitively, younger Greek and Turkish Cypriots, despite their lack of shared experience, do not necessarily offer the best hope for an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. Time is creating new generations with little or no experience of living together, leading them to perceive the other side as alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Unsolvable?
> For these reasons, while a settlement is theoretically possible, it seems increasingly unlikely that an agreement will ever be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

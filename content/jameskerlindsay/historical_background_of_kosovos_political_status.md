Kosovo has been a deeply divisive issue in modern international relations, with its 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia splitting world opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This decision continues to affect discussions on other conflicts, including Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While supporters argue Kosovo is a special case, many point out that its declaration violated the long-held principle that parts of states cannot unilaterally secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Even today, the international community remains deeply divided over the issue, with half of all UN members recognizing Kosovo as a sovereign independent state, while the other half still regards it as Serbian territory, albeit formally under UN administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The situation has broader implications, with separatist groups pointing to Kosovo as justification for their right to break away, and Russia using the case to justify its actions in eastern Ukraine, arguing that if Western states could declare Kosovo had a right to secede from Serbia, then the same case could be made for Crimea and the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Self-Determination and Unilateral Secession

The case of Kosovo highlights severe problems regarding the concepts of secession and self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While self-determination is a general concept, in modern international relations, it has come to mean two different things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>:
*   In colonial contexts (defined as overseas territories), it grants a right to independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   In the case of existing states, it means a right to meaningful self-rule, not a right to unilaterally break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Kosovo has been presented as an exception to this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. From a strictly legal point of view, [[legal_and_political_arguments_regarding_kosovos_independence | Kosovo's independence]] was contrary to established international relations principles regarding self-determination and the territorial integrity of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The right to self-determination leading to independence generally applies only to colonial territories or areas under military occupation, not to territories or peoples within existing states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. As Kosovo was part of Serbia, there was no generally recognized right for it to gain sovereign statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

The International Court of Justice's advisory opinion stated that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate international law, but it clarified that this referred only to the declaration itself, not to whether Kosovo was, in fact, a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The court merely stated there was no legal prohibition on the Kosovo authorities claiming to be a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The justification of Kosovo as a "unique case" is regarded as meaningless or dangerous, as breaking a rule creates a precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of Kosovo's Status

[[historical_context_of_albanian_territories | Kosovo's status]] is deeply rooted in its complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>:

### Early History
*   While there has long been an ethnic Albanian presence in the region, Kosovo became part of the medieval Serbian Kingdom before being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   This lasted until the Balkan Wars at the start of the 20th century, which forced the Ottomans from most of their remaining European holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Although an independent Kingdom of Albania was created, Kosovo was conquered by the Kingdom of Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   Following World War I, when Serbia united with other South Slavic states, Kosovo became part of the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   At this stage, it is generally accepted that most of Kosovo's population were ethnic Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Under Socialist Yugoslavia
*   After World War II, the Yugoslav monarchy was overthrown, and Josip Broz Tito reconstituted Yugoslavia as a communist federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Tito distinguished between "nations" (Bosnians, Croats, Montenegrins, Serbs, Slovenes), which were given their own federal republics, and "nationalities" (such as Albanians, Hungarians, Italians), which either had an external national state or were transnational communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   As Albanians fell into the "nationalities" category, Kosovo was never made a separate federal republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Instead, it became an autonomous province of Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Despite this, Kosovo steadily gained more powers, eventually gaining an individual seat on the Federal Executive Council alongside the six republics and Vojvodina (another autonomous Serbian province) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Crucially, under the 1974 Constitution, Kosovo and the Kosovo Albanians did not receive the nominal right to break away from Yugoslavia, unlike the "nations" and their republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Post-Tito and Yugoslav Wars
*   After Tito's death in 1980, Yugoslavia gradually weakened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. By the end of the decade, ethnic Serbs in Kosovo argued they faced growing discrimination by the ethnic Albanian majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   In March 1989, the Serbian president, Slobodan Milošević, abolished Kosovo's autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Opposition to Serbian rule increased, and in 1991, the Kosovo Albanians organized an unofficial referendum showing overwhelming support for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   As Yugoslavia collapsed, with Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Macedonia all breaking away, questions arose over Kosovo's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   While Kosovo Albanians argued for independence, an EU commission concluded that as Kosovo was not a formal republic, it did not have the right to secede and gain independence, and would have to remain part of Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Armed Insurgency and NATO Intervention
*   After the Bosnian war ended in 1995, and their calls for independence were ignored, the Kosovo Albanians launched an armed insurgency against Serbian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   By late 1998, fighting intensified, and civilian casualties grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   A peace conference convened in early 1999 failed to reach an agreement, and with the West blaming Milošević, NATO began bombing Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   In June 1999, after 78 days, Serbia agreed to withdraw its forces from Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The UN Security Council placed Kosovo under UN administration pending a final settlement under Resolution 1244, but Kosovo officially remained under Serbian sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Towards Independence
*   Tensions continued in the following years, with strong pressure for independence among the ethnic Albanian majority, erupting into major interethnic rioting in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Formal status talks began in early 2006, led by Martti Ahtisaari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Serbia was willing to offer extensive autonomy, but the Albanian population insisted on full sovereign statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   Facing a deadlock that threatened new violence, the United States and leading EU members agreed that independence was the only realistic outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   To avoid setting a dangerous precedent, they argued that [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | Kosovo's independence]] was a unique case based on three specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>:
    1.  Systematic human rights violations committed by Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    2.  Its status within Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    3.  Its period of self-rule under UN authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Following the failure of UN-led talks and a subsequent process overseen by the United States, Russia, and the European Union, [[kosovo_declaration_of_independence_and_international_response | Kosovo declared independence]] in February 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Post-Independence Status
*   While the United States, Britain, France, and most of the European Union immediately recognized Kosovo, Russia, China, and much of Africa and Asia refused, arguing that Serbia must agree to its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Fifteen years later, Kosovo remains recognized by only half the world, and continued Russian and Chinese opposition means it has no chance of joining the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The situation remains a deep source of contention with profound implications, with many observers regarding Kosovo as a prime example where the long-standing principle of the territorial integrity of states has been violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Serbia's Position and Future Outlook
Despite the legal complexities, Serbia's political position regarding Kosovo has been largely self-defeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Although Kosovo may not have had an automatic legal right to independence, Serbia should have accepted its will and allowed it to go its own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Within Yugoslavia, Kosovo amounted to a republic in all but name, and without Tito's decree, it would have been Yugoslavia's seventh republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Any remaining Serbian claim over Kosovo was effectively made redundant in 2006 when Montenegro split from Serbia and became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Serbia's claim that extensive autonomy was a serious option is unlikely, as the price for Kosovo to accept continued Serbian sovereignty would have required nearly complete autonomy, substantial representation in Serbian national parliament, government, civil service, diplomatic service, and military, and would have been extremely costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While some Serbs argue maintaining control over the historically and culturally significant area was worth the price, an amicable agreement to let Kosovo go would have been more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo has become a deep source of antagonism]] between Serbia and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

There is little ground for compromise at the extremes: some Serbs insist Kosovo is Serbia, ignoring the specific context, while some Kosovo Albanians and their Western supporters cling to the "unique case" idea, refusing to engage with Serbia on substantive questions of status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. For progress, Kosovo Albanians need to face the fact that their independence is built on an anomaly requiring compromise with Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Serbs also need to face the reality that, despite wounded pride, expecting Kosovo to remain under Serbian sovereignty is unrealistic in the broader context of Yugoslavia's breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The West also needs to recognize its mistakes and focus on a fair and equitable resolution, having imposed a settlement that went against international principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

Ideas for a settlement include considerable autonomy or redrawing borders to keep Serbian areas within Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. A mutually agreed separation specific to the circumstances would restore balance and set no precedent for other territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. However, a significant challenge remains: whether Russia would allow any deal between Kosovo and Serbia to pass through the UN Security Council without securing a similar arrangement for territories it seized in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The effects of the Kosovo case may well be felt for a long time to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

Mongolia has emerged as a critical focal point in international relations, largely due to its unique geographical position bordered by Russia to the north and China to the south, east, and west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Its foreign policy decisions, as a "pivot state," can significantly impact regional and international power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Over 2023 and 2024, [[Mongolias economic and strategic significance to the West | Mongolia]] has drawn increased attention from Washington and European capitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Historical Chinese Dominance

Mongolia, with a history spanning over 2,000 years and famously associated with the 13th-century Mongolian Empire of Genghis Khan, saw its empire fragment by the end of the 14th century, forcing Mongols back to Central Asian steppes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

In 1635, China invaded southern and eastern (Inner) Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. By the end of the 17th century, China had extended its control over the northern outer areas, which were threatened by the expanding Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This control was formalized in 1727 by a treaty between China and Russia, placing Mongolia under Chinese authority for nearly 200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Emergence of Soviet Influence

When the ruling Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1911, Mongolian nationalists declared independence amidst political chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Although Chinese forces briefly regained control, Mongolian revolutionaries, supported by the newly formed Soviet Union, expelled them in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The Mongolian People's Republic was proclaimed in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Initially, the USSR did not recognize Mongolia, still considering it part of China, which continued to claim the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This stance likely prevented Mongolia from becoming another Soviet republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. However, the USSR steadily expanded its control, turning Mongolia into a Soviet puppet state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A mutual assistance protocol signed in 1936 led to the deployment of Soviet troops in Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

In 1945, at the close of World War II, the Soviet Union finally recognized Mongolia's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. China's Nationalist government also accepted Mongolia's statehood under the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Even after the Chinese Communist Party's victory, the new People's Republic of China adhered to the agreement, establishing diplomatic relations with Mongolia on October 16, 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Cold War Relations

Despite China's acceptance, Mongolia remained closely allied with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, profoundly affecting its external relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. While good relations with China initially persisted, marked by a border agreement in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, the Sino-Soviet split in the late 1950s and early 1960s caused a collapse in ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This was exacerbated by Soviet troops being stationed again in Mongolia in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Mongolia became more integrated with Soviet satellite states, joining Comecon, but was denied entry into the Warsaw Pact due to Eastern European concerns about antagonizing China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Under the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), Soviet influence permeated all sectors, leading to Russian becoming widely spoken and many Mongolians studying in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Rebalancing

The collapse of the USSR in the late 1980s, after nearly 70 years of Soviet control, drastically changed Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Multiparty democracy was introduced in 1990, followed by the abandonment of the communist system and the dissolution of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The end of the Cold War and the loss of its benefactor led to a severe economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Relations with the new Russian Federation soured when Moscow demanded repayment of aid given since 1946 and halted technical assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This forced Mongolia to forge new international ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Despite a tense history and lingering mistrust, relations with China rapidly improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. A Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed in 1994, leading to a massive expansion of trade and investment, particularly in the mining sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Within a decade, China became Mongolia's most significant economic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

By the turn of the millennium, political and strategic ties with Russia also dramatically improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Unlike former Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe, many Mongolians maintained a positive view of Russia as a natural partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. After resolving the debt issue in 2004, political, economic, and military cooperation steadily strengthened over the next decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This culminated in a Treaty of Friendship and a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Stance

While recognizing the necessity of close ties with its immediate neighbors, Mongolia also developed its [[Mongolias Third Neighbor Policy | Third Neighbor Policy]] due to concerns about over-reliance, especially on China's expanding influence in critical sectors like mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This policy involved deepening ties with other countries, including key Western states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The [[Impact of the Ukraine war on Mongolias diplomatic stance | Ukraine war]] in early 2022 altered this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Initially, Mongolia adopted a cautious, neutral approach, abstaining from UN votes condemning the invasion due to concerns about relations with Moscow and reliance on Russian energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. However, as the war progressed, subtle shifts emerged, such as the president's call for peace at the UN in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

A significant development has been the increasing contacts with Western countries since early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. High-level engagements with the United States continued, and European countries showed growing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. For example, French President Emmanuel Macron visited in May 2023, with French officials explicitly stating the goal was to loosen Russia's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Germany signed a strategic partnership in February 2024, and the British Foreign Secretary visited in April 2024 to lay foundations for a future partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. These developments are partly driven by the disastrous economic effect of the war on Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, generational shifts in foreign policy outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, and growing nervousness about the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Despite these recent shifts, Mongolia is not abandoning its close ties to Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Its geography makes such a move impractical, and a concerted alignment with the West could lead to isolation from Beijing and Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Instead, Mongolia seeks to protect its autonomy while maintaining relations with both neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. As its two powerful neighbors grow closer, Mongolia's [[Mongolias foreign policy and international relations | foreign policy]] appears to be pivoting not *towards* the West, but *towards* its third neighbor: the rest of the world, including the West, to avoid being squeezed between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

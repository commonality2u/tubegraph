Throughout 2023, there has been a growing concern about the [[rise_of_sikh_separatist_sentiment_in_india | rise of Sikh separatist sentiment in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This recent resurgence of the movement for an independent Sikh state, known as Khalistan, is rooted in a long and often violent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Origins of Sikhism and Early Persecution

The story of Sikhism begins in 1469 with the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith, near Lahore in present-day Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Guru Nanak preached a monotheistic religion, Sikhism (derived from the Punjabi word 'Sikh' meaning 'Learner'), that combined elements of Islam and Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. It emphasized inward meditation, moral conduct, and charitable giving, rejecting many outward symbols of piety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

After Guru Nanak's death, nine more gurus followed, refining the faith until the last, Guru Gobind Singh, died in 1708 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. From its early days, Sikhs faced persecution from the Muslim Mughal Empire, which executed two of the ten gurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. They also came under attack from neighboring Afghanistan, leading to many Sikh deaths and repeated destruction of their most important shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This persecution fostered a strong sense of community, cemented by the Khalsa, or 'the Pure', and led to increased militarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## The Sikh Empire and British Influence

As the Mughal Empire weakened in the late 18th century, Sikhs established their own political entity, the Sikh Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. However, this changed with the expansion of British Imperial control in India in the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Britain came into conflict with the Sikh Empire, resulting in two fierce wars in 1845 and 1848 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. British forces eventually prevailed, bringing the area under imperial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Following this, Sikhs formed a close relationship with the British authorities, with hundreds of thousands serving in the British Indian Army during the First and Second World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Partition of India and Calls for Khalistan

After World War II, Britain agreed to decolonize India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Due to growing tensions between the country's two central religious communities, it controversially decided to partition the territory, creating a Muslim state, Pakistan, in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Simultaneously, calls for a separate Sikh state were rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Instead, Punjab was divided, and almost all Sikhs in Pakistan relocated to the Indian-controlled eastern part of the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

As a minority in predominantly Hindu India, calls for greater cultural and political rights grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. While some dreamed of a fully independent and sovereign Sikh state, Khalistan ('the Land of the Pure') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, others sought a separate Sikh-majority Punjabi federal state within India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This Punjabi federal state was granted in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. However, due to the centralized nature of India's political system, this fell short of expectations, leading to growing tensions in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## The Rise of Modern Sikh Separatism

With increasing calls for greater self-rule, confrontations intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Elements within the extensive Sikh diaspora became increasingly vocal about an independent Sikh Homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The National Council of Khalistan was created in 1980 by Jagjit Singh Chohan, a former Punjabi Finance Minister who became an exile leader of the independence movement based in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### The Events of 1984: Operation Blue Star

The issue gained worldwide attention in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Reports emerged that Sikh militants, led by the charismatic Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, were fortifying the Golden Temple complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. On June 1, 1984, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered troops to storm the site, launching "Operation Blue Star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This week-long operation was a bloodbath; the Indian government claimed 500 militants (including Bhindranwale) and 80 Indian soldiers were killed, while Sikh groups disputed this, claiming thousands died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Parts of the Golden Temple complex were also severely damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

These events had profound implications just months later. On October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge for the temple storming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This, in turn, led to anti-Sikh riots across India that left almost 3,500 people dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### International Repercussions and Decline of Militancy

Internationally, the events of 1984 ignited Sikh sentiment and attracted many to the independence cause, fueling the Khalistani movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. It also led to one of the world's worst terrorist attacks: the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight from Toronto by Sikh separatists, killing all 329 on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

However, within India, the militant independence movement began to weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. While groups like Babbar Khalsa continued attacks, their potency diminished due to continued police crackdowns and a fractured broader movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. By the turn of the millennium, the armed campaign seemed finished, and many Sikhs became disillusioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Jagjit Singh Chohan, the exile leader, was pardoned and returned to India, where he died in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

The passage of time also tempered feelings within the diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The movement for an independent Khalistan appeared to be slowly petering out, aided by an increasingly aggressive clampdown on Sikh militants by Western governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. For example, in 2001, Britain proscribed Babbar Khalsa as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Current Status

In 2018, reports of renewed militancy emerged in Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. The Indian government banned the U.S.-based group Sikhs for Justice, accusing it of destabilizing the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. While some suggested [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | Pakistan]] was behind the tensions, others pointed to rising poverty in Punjab, once one of India's wealthiest states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This led to growing social problems and major protests in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

At this point, a new pro-independence figure, Amritpal Singh, emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Modeling himself on Bhindranwale, Singh came to lead "Heirs of Punjab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. In February 2023, hundreds of his supporters stormed a jail following the arrest of a group member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Fears of an increasingly militant pro-independence group resurfacing led police to launch a massive hunt for Singh the following month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Singh was peacefully arrested on April 23, 2023, in central Punjab and has been detained under India's National Security Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

For now, it appears that Singh's arrest will not spark a new wave of violence within India, as there were no widespread protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Many observers believe most Indian Sikhs oppose violent separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Nevertheless, fears of a return to the past persist, and police remain cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Internationally, the effects are still being felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The Indian government has expressed concerns about the security of its diplomatic missions in Canada following protests outside its Consulate in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. A UK government commission report also highlighted a growing pro-Khalistan extremist element within the British Sikh community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Despite the unlikelihood of a violent new phase in Punjab, the idea of an independent Sikh homeland retains appeal both in India and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

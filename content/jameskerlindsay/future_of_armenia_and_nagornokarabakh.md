In October and early November 2020, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Armenia and Azerbaijan]] fought a brief but bloody war over [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] [00:00:00]. After a 44-day conflict, Azerbaijani forces retook significant territory, leading to a Moscow-brokered ceasefire agreement that stationed Russian peacekeepers in the region [00:00:07]. A year after the conflict, key questions remain about how people in Armenia perceive the situation and where they believe it is headed [00:00:18].

For almost three decades, the conflict over [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] was one of the most serious territorial disputes globally [00:01:03]. The 2020 war saw Azerbaijan retake large parts of the territory [00:01:09].

## Historical Context and Escalation

The issue of [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] emerged with the end of the Soviet Union [00:01:34]. Predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians, [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] was an autonomous province of Azerbaijan [00:01:41]. As the USSR disintegrated, it broke away, declaring independence in January 1992 [00:01:47]. This sparked a war where the Armenian side not only consolidated control over [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] but also seized surrounding Azerbaijani districts [00:01:53].

Efforts to resolve the conflict followed, with the sides agreeing on guiding settlement principles, but little progress was made towards a final agreement [00:02:04]. While the conflict became known as "frozen," it remained active with frequent confrontations and major outbreaks of fighting [00:02:16]. For example, a four-day conflict in 2016 resulted in several hundred casualties [00:02:27]. Another outbreak occurred in July 2020, serving as a prelude to the full-scale war that erupted at the end of September 2020 [00:02:33]. This war lasted six weeks [00:02:46]. By the time Russia brokered a ceasefire on November 10, all Armenian-held areas surrounding [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]], and a considerable part of [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] itself, had been retaken by Azerbaijani forces [00:02:49]. What remains beyond Azerbaijan's control is now protected by Russian peacekeepers [00:03:02].

## [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia's Response and Perspective on the Conflict]]

A year after the war, [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenians]] grapple with its impact. The conflict has challenged a sense of invulnerability that had developed over decades of Armenian control over [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] and its surrounding areas [00:04:48].

### Expectation of War
From [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia's perspective]], the war was not only expected but often seen as unavoidable [00:03:58]. They were aware of statements from Azerbaijan, its military buildup, arms purchases, and the rise in incidents along the ceasefire line [00:03:48]. Many believe Azerbaijan had decided on a conflict and was not interested in a negotiated settlement [00:04:03].

### Explaining the Defeat
The defeat is an extremely sensitive and difficult subject for the country [00:04:42]. There is significant anger regarding Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, specifically in terms of equipment, military leadership, and guidance [00:05:04]. Many feel Turkey directed the war, leading to a deeply held view that Azerbaijan did not engage in a fair fight [00:05:13]. Some argue the outcome would have differed without Turkish and, to some degree, Israeli technical support [00:05:21].

### Perception of Outside Actors
*   **European Union and United States:** There is a clear sense of disillusionment about their lack of action [00:05:54]. Beyond the belief that they should have intervened to stop the war, there's a geopolitical and even civilizational aspect to this sentiment [00:06:01]. Many references were made to the idea that [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] is the one country preventing a Turkic arc stretching from Europe to Central Asia [00:06:10]. People believe [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia's]] vital position should be understood, and the country should be fully supported [00:06:19].
*   **[[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia]]:** The picture regarding [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia]] is complex [00:06:26]. While [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] was considered to have a close relationship with Moscow, and many still consider Moscow a key ally with strong influence [00:06:32], there is a real sense of anger and suspicion about [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia's]] role in the war [00:06:42]. This stems from [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia]] only stepping in at the last moment, after most Armenian-held territory had been lost [00:06:48]. While some trust [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia]] out of a perceived lack of alternative allies, there is a sense that this trust is not truly held [00:06:54].

## Societal Impact and "Unfinished Business"

On the surface, particularly in central Yerevan, there is little to indicate a country overcoming a major war [00:07:35]. The city appears remarkably normal to an outside observer, with bustling activity, good restaurants, high-end shops, and nice cars [00:07:43]. However, beneath this apparent normality, the war has had a profound effect [00:08:00]. No family was untouched; many volunteered, thousands were killed, and many are still missing [00:08:06]. Occasional stark reminders, such as plaques to fallen soldiers, highlight the ongoing impact [00:08:14].

There is a strong sense of "unfinished business" [00:08:29].
*   **2020 Conflict Aftermath:** Armenian soldiers are still held prisoner by Azerbaijan, with allegations of torture and executions [00:08:36]. This remains an extremely sensitive issue [00:08:44].
*   **Ongoing Skirmishes:** The 2020 conflict is not truly perceived as over, with ongoing skirmishes along the new ceasefire line, including a particularly heavy bout of fighting in November 2021 [00:08:47]. Many believe full-scale fighting could erupt again [00:08:58].

## Future Outlook for Nagorno-Karabakh

For the longer term, there is an outward sense that people have not given up on [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] (Artsakh) [00:09:03]. They believe it is not lost, that the 2020 war was a setback, and that the land will be retaken [00:09:10]. While it is difficult to gauge the extent of bravado versus genuine belief, there is a sincere conviction that [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] is, and should be, a part of [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] [00:09:17]. Just as Azerbaijanis spoke of their territory being held by Armenians, Armenians now speak of their territory being held by Azerbaijanis [00:09:27]. This indicates that, in the minds of Armenians, the conflict has not ended [00:09:36].

However, how it will be resolved is unclear [00:09:42]. A compromise involving some form of territorial autonomy does not currently seem acceptable to either side [00:09:46]. From the Armenian perspective, it is far too soon to talk about any longer-term settlement, let alone reconciliation, between [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] and Azerbaijan [00:09:53].

## Conclusion

The 2020 war between [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] and Azerbaijan, though expected, proved quicker and more decisive than many anticipated [00:10:19]. Azerbaijan achieved a major victory, only stopped from a decisive conflict-ending triumph by [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia's]] last-moment ceasefire brokerage [00:10:28].

A year later, key themes emerge from the Armenian perspective [00:10:39]:
*   The war was expected and inevitable, but perceived as won by Azerbaijan only with outside help [00:10:57].
*   There is disillusionment regarding the role of other external actors [00:11:05].
*   There is a strong belief that this is not the end of the story, and Artsakh remains Armenian [00:11:08].

Despite the surface appearance of normality in Yerevan, it is evident that the reality of the situation has not fully sunken in [00:11:15]. As one diaspora Armenian living in the city noted, behind the apparent normality, [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] is a country still in a state of denial about what happened [00:11:32].

The [[peace_agreement_between_ethiopia_and_tigray | peace agreement]] reached on November 2, 2022, between the Ethiopian federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) marked a crucial turning point in the two-year [[ethiopia_and_tigray_conflict_overview | Ethiopia and Tigray conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The conflict, largely overlooked by the international community, had become the world's deadliest, costing up to half a million lives and displacing over 3 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

At the time of the agreement, the federal Ethiopian government, supported by forces from neighboring Eritrea, had gained the upper hand and was poised for a final military victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This impending victory was predicted by many to lead to a bloodbath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Despite widespread skepticism about the possibility of peace due to the "depth of hatred" between the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, ten days of intensive negotiations organized by the African Union in South Africa led to the breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The parties agreed to "permanently silence the guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Key Terms of the Peace Agreement

The agreement is primarily built around four points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>:

*   **Territorial Integrity** Tigray will remain an integral part of Ethiopia, confirming the country's territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Single National Defense Force** Ethiopia will maintain a single National Defense Force. This necessitates the disarmament and disbandment of the Tigrayan Defense Force (TDF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Re-establishment of Constitutional Order** The constitutional order will be re-established in Tigray, likely leading to new elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Given the TPLF's participation in the agreement, it is implied that they will be permitted to remain a political force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Aid and Reconstruction** Humanitarian aid will be dispatched to the Tigray region, and efforts for reconstruction will commence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Additionally, both the government and the TPLF committed to promoting the [[peace_agreement_between_ethiopia_and_tigray | peace deal]] and called upon all Ethiopians, both domestically and abroad, to support the agreement, in language designed to foster national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Implications for the Ethiopian Government

The agreement is seen as a clear victory for the Ethiopian Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. It spared the government from a final military onslaught, preventing a further horrific loss of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Allowing a demilitarized TPLF to remain in political control in Tigray may be more advantageous than imposing a new, potentially resented administration after a catastrophic military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Behind the scenes, there was likely considerable encouragement and coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This could have included promises of reconstruction aid and warnings of serious sanctions or even war crimes investigations if cooperation failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The deal also seems to pave the way for internal arrangements for justice and reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Implications for Tigray and the TPLF

For the TPLF, despite facing imminent military defeat, the agreement offers enough to secure its support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Its "big gain" from the deal appears to be the allowance for the TPLF to remain a political force in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. However, the TDF will be disarmed and disbanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Challenges

The [[peace_agreement_between_ethiopia_and_tigray | peace agreement]] is considered a remarkable achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, preventing a potentially horrific situation and the loss of further lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Special credit is due to the African Union and IGAD (the main regional organization), as well as the United States for its important role behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

However, the conflict cannot be definitively declared over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The success of the agreement will heavily depend on its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Given the deep hatred that clearly exists between the sides, many remain skeptical that they will be able to mend fences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Nevertheless, after two years of bitter and bloody fighting, Ethiopia appears to be finally on the path to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

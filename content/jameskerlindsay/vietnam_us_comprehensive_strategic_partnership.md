In September 2023, US President Joe Biden made a state visit to Vietnam at the invitation of the Communist Party's Secretary General, Vietnam's most senior political leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This visit culminated in the signing of a comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Hailed as a historic moment by both governments, this agreement signals an extraordinary turnaround in [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | ties between two countries]] with a notoriously difficult past and ongoing fundamental ideological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The evolution of the [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | relationship between the United States and Vietnam]] stands out as a prime example of countries building links after conflict, moving from a bitter and brutal war to a close strategic partnership despite their ideological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Historical Context

Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, is located in Southeast Asia, bordered by Cambodia, Laos, and China to its west and north, and the [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | South China Sea]] to its south and east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Its history includes significant influence and direct rule from China, followed by European colonial expansion in the 19th century, leading to French control and the formation of the Union of French Indochina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Under French rule, Vietnam was heavily exploited, leading to the emergence of an anti-colonial movement and a Communist Party led by Ho Chi Minh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The outbreak of World War II saw France lose control over Vietnam, which was then occupied by Imperial Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. After Japan's defeat, Ho Chi Minh declared the independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sparking the First Indochina War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The US, fearing a communist takeover, supported France against Vietnamese guerrilla forces backed by China and the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. After France's withdrawal, a peace agreement in July 1954 divided Vietnam, pending national elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This partition was rejected by the United States and South Vietnam, leading to the Second Indochina War, famously known as the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### The Vietnam War and Its Aftermath

The US steadily increased its military commitment in Vietnam from the 1960s, deploying over half a million personnel by the latter half of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The conflict became increasingly brutal, with the US launching devastating bombing campaigns and using chemicals to destroy forestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. By 1970, facing growing domestic opposition and the South losing the war, the US began drawing down its presence and engaged in peace talks, leading to an agreement in 1973 for the final withdrawal of US forces and peaceful reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, conflict continued for several more years until North Vietnamese troops captured Saigon on April 30, 1975, uniting the country under communist control as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

The [[impact_of_vietnam_war_on_vietnam_and_the_us | war profoundly affected both Vietnam and the United States]] socially, politically, and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Vietnam suffered massive loss of life (up to three million dead) and widespread destruction, along with ongoing issues from mines, unexploded bombs, and long-term environmental and health damage from chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Vietnam linked any normalisation of ties to significant development aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The US, having lost its first war, sustained almost 60,000 troop deaths and faced issues regarding over 2,500 personnel missing in action or held as POWs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Consequently, Washington imposed an embargo on Vietnam, hindering its reconstruction and making it reliant on the Soviet Union, especially after its relations with China collapsed in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Normalisation of Ties

Despite the bitter legacy, relations began to shift in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Vietnam's Communist Party began opening its economy and agreed to assist with the issue of US personnel missing in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. In response, Washington allowed non-governmental aid organisations to engage with Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which deprived Vietnam of its crucial ally and left it with ongoing tensions with Beijing, forced Vietnam to rethink its orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Simultaneously, US attitudes changed as immediate memories of the Vietnam War faded, and the US, emerging as the sole hyperpower, accepted the need for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This process culminated in 1994 when, following efforts by two senior US senators who had served in Vietnam, the United States lifted its embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The two countries normalised their relations the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Strengthening Relations Post-Normalization

By the new millennium, [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | relations were changing rapidly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Presidential Visits**: Bill Clinton became the first US president to visit Vietnam since the war's end in November 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Barack Obama visited in May 2016, and George W. Bush and Donald Trump also visited for multilateral meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **[[trade_and_economic_ties_between_the_us_and_vietnam | Economic Ties]]**: Building on the sizable Vietnamese diaspora in the US, [[trade_and_economic_ties_between_the_us_and_vietnam | economic ties]] rapidly developed, with investment and trade growing, underpinned by agreements signed in 2001 and 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Environmental Initiatives**: The two countries established educational and cultural programs and launched initiatives to address environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Remaining Differences

Despite flourishing ties, critical differences remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Trade Imbalance**: There are concerns about a massive trade imbalance; of the US$150 billion in bilateral trade, 80 percent comprises Vietnamese exports to the US, raising questions about market access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Democracy and Human Rights**: Issues of democracy and human rights underpin the relationship. The US State Department highlights concerns about Vietnam as an authoritarian state with serious corruption, problems relating to freedoms of expression and movement, arbitrary arrest, judicial independence, and cruel and unusual punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Key Driver: Security and China

The primary factor now driving the [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | relationship]] is security, specifically mutual concern over [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China's growing regional and international significance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. While Vietnam and China share a long history, and China supported the North during the Vietnam War, their [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | relationship has been strained since the 1970s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This includes a brief conflict in 1979 and sporadic border skirmishes in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Even after diplomatic relations were restored in 1991, tensions have continued, particularly concerning a steadily escalating dispute over the [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | South China Sea]], where China has increasingly asserted its territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This dispute has been the key factor shaping the [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | relationship between Vietnam and the United States]] over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It has driven economic and political ties, as well as an increase in defence and security cooperation, including regular discussions, US provision of military equipment and training, and joint military exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Vietnam-China Relations Nuance

Despite the tensions, [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam's relations with China]] are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. China remains Vietnam's largest trading partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. As neighbours ruled by communist parties, they continue to share ideological and political similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Vietnam also has no wish to see a [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | full-scale conflict with China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam-China relationship]] is a delicate balance of cooperation and rivalry, influenced by historical, economic, and geopolitical factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### China's Reaction

China appears to recognize a shift following the latest meeting between Biden and the Vietnamese leadership, seemingly rattled by the deepening [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | ties between Vietnam and the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. This was highlighted in October 2023 when, a month after Biden's visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly appealed to Vietnam to remember their past "good times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. As tensions continue to escalate in the [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | South China Sea]], Vietnam is expected to continue moving closer to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

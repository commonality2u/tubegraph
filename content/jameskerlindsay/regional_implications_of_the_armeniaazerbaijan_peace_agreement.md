On 9 November 2020, Armenia and Azerbaijan reached a [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | peace agreement]] concerning the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, following a brief but bloody conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While Azerbaijan heralded the agreement as a resolution, it also raised significant questions about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict
The [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan]] over Nagorno-Karabakh reignited on 27 September 2020, raising concerns about a prolonged conflict in the South Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, the war concluded much faster than anticipated, lasting only six weeks after swift Azerbaijani advances into Armenian-held territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Russia brokered the [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | peace agreement]] on the evening of 9 November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The dispute is centered on Nagorno-Karabakh, a region predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians, which was part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. When the Soviet Union dissolved, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This led to a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, resulting in Armenian forces controlling Nagorno-Karabakh and several surrounding Azerbaijani districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

In subsequent years, efforts led by Russia, the United States, and France attempted to resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Principles for a solution included:
*   The return of surrounding districts to Azerbaijan's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The return of internally displaced persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   A land link between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   An agreement on Nagorno-Karabakh's future status, confirmed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Security measures to underpin any deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Despite these agreed terms, no final deal was reached, and a return to war became increasingly likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Azerbaijan significantly increased its military spending, leading to fears of it planning to retake territories by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Major confrontations occurred in 2016 and July 2020 before full-scale fighting erupted on 27 September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Azerbaijan quickly retook most of the southern territory and entered Nagorno-Karabakh proper, capturing its second-largest town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Facing imminent defeat, Armenia agreed to a Russian-brokered ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Terms of the Peace Agreement
The November 2020 [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | peace agreement]] included several key provisions:
*   **Territorial Changes**: Azerbaijan regained control of all districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, including those captured during the war and those Armenia was to hand over by 1 December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Azerbaijan also retained control of areas within Nagorno-Karabakh captured prior to the ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Armenia was to withdraw all its armed forces from Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Transport Links**: Armenia retained a direct transport link with Nagorno-Karabakh, with Azerbaijan guaranteeing the safety of travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Crucially for Azerbaijan, a new road was to be built across Armenian territory, connecting the main part of Azerbaijan with its western exclave, Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This eliminated Azerbaijan's previous reliance on air links or a road through Iran to reach Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Provisions**: All internally displaced persons were to be allowed to return to their properties in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, overseen by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. An exchange of prisoners of war and other detainees, and the return of bodies, were also agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Guarantees**: The agreement was guaranteed by Russia, with nearly 2,000 Russian troops stationed along the ceasefire line for an initial five-year period, automatically renewable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Russian troops and border guards also control the corridors between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and between Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Regional Implications
The [[impact_of_the_peace_agreement_on_armenia_and_azerbaijan | impact of the peace agreement on Armenia and Azerbaijan]] had significant regional implications, altering the balance of power and influence.

### Implications for Azerbaijan
The agreement represented a huge victory for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Having been defeated in the early 1990s, Azerbaijan felt it had restored its honor by reclaiming territories around Nagorno-Karabakh and making significant encroachments within Nagorno-Karabakh itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. President Ilham Aliyev declared the districts and even Karabakh itself liberated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The secured land link to Nakhchivan further emphasized the scale of Azerbaijan's win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Azerbaijan's decision not to press for total territorial control was strategic:
*   **Preventing a Prolonged War**: While the war had gone smoothly, a complete takeover might have become more prolonged and costly, especially with winter approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Achieved Key Goals**: The main objectives, including the return of surrounding districts and neutralizing Nagorno-Karabakh as a credible separatist threat, were achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Nakhchivan Corridor**: Allowing Nagorno-Karabakh to continue to exist provided a bargaining chip for securing the vital land corridor with Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Had Nagorno-Karabakh been completely overrun, this leverage would have been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Implications for Armenia
For Armenia, the agreement was a devastating defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's statement that "this is not a victory, but there is no defeat until you consider yourself defeated" reflected the grim reality that Armenia had no choice but to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The leader of Nagorno-Karabakh confirmed that continued military action would have resulted in the loss of all of Nagorno-Karabakh and more casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The news was met with shock and anger in Armenia, leading to protests and calls for the Prime Minister's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

However, the outcome, while bad, was not a complete disaster:
*   **Averted Greater Catastrophe**: The feared prospect of Azerbaijan completely overrunning Nagorno-Karabakh, with the potential for ethnic cleansing or genocide, was averted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Viable Entity Remains**: Enough of Nagorno-Karabakh remained to constitute a viable entity for future talks between Yerevan and Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Role and Implications for Turkey
Turkey was delighted with the outcome, calling it a "sacred success" for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Turkey had openly sided with Baku, possibly even encouraging the conflict, which burnished President ErdoÄŸan's credentials at home and in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The creation of a land corridor across Armenia establishes a direct road link between Ankara and Baku, strengthening close economic, political, and ethnic ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Role and Implications for Russia
Russia emerged as perhaps the most significant winner in the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Initially, Moscow appeared hesitant to respond to the crisis, despite a defense agreement with Armenia and obvious Turkish involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, Russia also sought to avoid alienating Azerbaijan, aiming to maintain its position as a regional hegemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Russia adopted the role of "peacemaker," carefully choosing its moment to maximize its advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>:
*   **Strategic Timing**: The agreement came at a perfect moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Any sooner would have damaged ties with Baku, which was winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Any later, after Nagorno-Karabakh was completely lost, would have stripped Russia of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Influence over Armenia**: Had Nagorno-Karabakh fallen, Armenians might have blamed Moscow for not intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. As it stands, Armenia remains reliant on Moscow to retain what they still hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Expanded Regional Footprint**: The presence of Russian peacekeepers in Azerbaijan significantly extends Russia's regional influence and footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This represents a significant shift in the [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | role of Russia in the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process]].

## Future Outlook
In the immediate [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | future of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh]], efforts will focus on meeting the terms of the agreement, completing exchanges, and facilitating the return of internally displaced persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Looking ahead, the continued existence of Nagorno-Karabakh, protected by Russian peacekeepers, means the issue remains on the table, though the nature of discussions will change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Nagorno-Karabakh's hopes of consolidating independent statehood are now over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The prospect of securing extensive autonomy within Azerbaijan also appears unlikely for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. President Aliyev has explicitly stated there will be "no status of any sort" for Nagorno-Karabakh, declaring, "They wanted independence. They were offered autonomy. Now they get nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

However, in the longer term, Baku might be willing to discuss options, potentially as part of a comprehensive settlement with Armenia that could include trade-offs related to consolidating the corridor between Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

```ad-warning
The [[2020_armenia_azerbaijan_war_impact | 2020 Armenia-Azerbaijan war impact]] led to Azerbaijan's overwhelming military victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Despite this, the dispute is not entirely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Russia's strategically timed intervention leaves the issue in limbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. While the Nagorno-Karabakh republic no longer exists as a de facto state, important loose ends remain unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The key question is whether Armenia and Azerbaijan can reach an historic overall political settlement, or if Russia, and perhaps Turkey, will keep the dispute "on ice" indefinitely to maintain their regional leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

The Mediterranean island of Cyprus is described as one of the world's most unlikely conflict zones, despite its fun, vibrant, and beautiful nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It was the scene of bitter and brutal fighting in the 1960s and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. To this day, it remains one of the most entrenched [[ethnic_tensions_in_nigeria | ethnic conflicts]] in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and it hosts the longest-running major [[united_nations_peacekeeping_in_cyprus | United Nations]] peacemaking and peacekeeping mission in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. After almost 60 years of efforts, many question whether [[prospects_for_reunification_of_cyprus | Cyprus can still be solved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Unsolvable Conflict?

For many working in conflict resolution, the idea of an unsolvable conflict is seen as heresy, with the belief that every conflict can be settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, [[cyprus_dispute_and_its_impact | Cyprus]] is often cited as a prime example of a seemingly unsolvable conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For over six decades, the [[united_nations_peacekeeping_in_cyprus | United Nations]] has led international efforts to broker an agreement between the island's Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Demographics and Division

Cyprus, the 162nd largest member of the [[united_nations_peacekeeping_in_cyprus | United Nations]], is geographically located at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Although the Republic of Cyprus is the only internationally recognised state on the island, the country remains divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), recognised only by Turkey, constitutes around 36-37 percent of the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Britain also retains two large military bases in Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The island's population is believed to be around 1.2 million, but the exact numbers and proportions of Greek and Turkish Cypriots are highly contested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This is partly due to a steady flow of settlers from mainland Turkey to the north since the island's division in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Most analysts refer to the 1960 population balance at independence: Greek Cypriots made up 78 percent, Turkish Cypriots 18 percent, and the remaining four percent comprised Maronites, Armenians, and Latins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## [[historical_background_of_cyprus_conflict | Historical Context of the Conflict]]

[[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] has a rich history, settled by Bronze Age Greeks thousands of years ago, and later ruled by various empires including Egyptian, Persian, Roman, Arab, Byzantine, Crusader, and Venetian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. A turning point occurred in 1571 with the conquest by the Ottoman Empire, which brought the first Turkish inhabitants – ancestors of today's Turkish Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

In 1878, the Ottomans transferred administrative control to Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. From this point, the majority Greek Christian inhabitants advocated for "enosis" (union) with the Kingdom of Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Britain initially refused and continued to do so even after the new Republic of Turkey relinquished its claim in 1925, and Cyprus became a British Crown Colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

In 1955, Greek Cypriots launched an armed campaign for enosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This, in turn, led Turkish Cypriots to call for "taksim" (partition) of Cyprus between Greece and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Independence and Division

As the island neared civil war in 1959, Greece and Turkey reached a compromise: Cyprus would become an independent state with power-sharing between the two communities, guaranteed by Greece, Turkey, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The Republic of Cyprus was formally established on August 16, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Despite hopes for a fresh start, tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Many Greek Cypriots resented being denied union with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The power-sharing system quickly strained over issues like local government and military divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. In December 1963, fighting erupted after Turkey rejected Greek Cypriot constitutional proposals, leading to the collapse of the joint government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Peace was restored in March 1964 with the establishment of a [[united_nations_peacekeeping_in_cyprus | United Nations peacekeeping force]], but UN-led efforts for a political agreement failed for the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

In July 1974, violence escalated again when Greece's military regime attempted to overthrow the Cypriot government to secure enosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Turkey invoked its guarantor rights and invaded the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This resulted in the displacement of around 200,000 Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the division of Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Post-Division Efforts and Deadlock

After the division, the UN continued settlement efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In 1977, both sides agreed on a federal arrangement consisting of two territorial units corresponding to the two communities – a "bizonal, bicommunal federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Despite this, Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence in November 1983, a move condemned by the [[united_nations_peacekeeping_in_cyprus | UN Security Council]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Talks continued throughout the 1980s and 90s but remained deadlocked, largely due to the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leadership, backed by Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

By 2000, with [[implications_of_cyprus_eu_membership_on_regional_politics | Cyprus preparing to join the European Union]], a new UN initiative launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In 2004, the UN proposed a reunification plan, widely endorsed internationally and accepted by two-thirds of Turkish Cypriots, but rejected by three-quarters of Greek Cypriots in a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Settlement efforts have continued since, with the most recent major initiative being a UN conference in 2017, which also failed to achieve a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Key Points of Disagreement

Almost 60 years after the initial fighting and half a century after the island's division, many observers believe a settlement is nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Three key points of difference exist between the sides:

1.  **[[governance_and_political_disagreements_in_cyprus | Governance]]**: This covers the structure of the federal state and community representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Turkish Cypriots, though the smaller community, insist on political equality and protection from being sidelined by the Greek Cypriot majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Greek Cypriots, conversely, demand a functional state where the Turkish Cypriot minority cannot exert a "tyranny" or break away again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
2.  **Territory and Property**: Around 36-37 percent of the island is currently under Turkish Cypriot control, but observers believe this would need to be reduced to 25-29 percent in a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Questions remain about the return of Greek Cypriot property in areas remaining under Turkish Cypriot control, compensation for those who cannot or do not wish to return, and the rights of original inhabitants or their descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
3.  **Security**: This is particularly sensitive for Greek Cypriots, who insist that the 1960 settlement provisions allowing Greece and Turkey to station troops and intervene in constitutional threats (as happened in 1974) must be abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Many Turkish Cypriots, however, view the presence of Turkish troops and the right of Turkish intervention as the ultimate guarantee of their security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

Additional issues include the fate of Turkish settlers, the nature of a future peacekeeping force, and the management of transitional arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## The Problem of Political Will

The core issue preventing a solution is the lack of political will in both communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. While theoretically a settlement could be reached quickly, the complex attitudes within each community hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Greek Cypriot Perspectives
Greek Cypriot attitudes range from those genuinely supporting a federal agreement and reunification to hardline nationalists who view Cyprus as Greek and Turkish Cypriots as unwanted newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Many Greek Cypriots also fear reunification, seeing it as too risky and potentially leading to renewed political deadlock and instability for a country that has become a successful holiday destination and stable business base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The concern is that another referendum rejection would lead the world to abandon settlement talks entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Turkish Cypriot Perspectives
While generally believed to favor reunification, this cannot be taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Hardliners oppose reunification, preferring isolation in an unrecognised state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Even moderate Turkish Cypriots, despite seeing the advantages of reunification (especially given Turkey's growing control in the north), often demand too much or fail to be realistic about the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

A significant concern is Turkey's increasingly tight grip over the north, with growing fears that Ankara may attempt to annex the territory, effectively ending any hope of reunification for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Generational Divide
Contrary to intuition, time does not appear to be fostering pro-settlement voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Younger generations in both communities have little to no experience of truly living together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. For them, the "other side" is essentially a foreign country inhabited by people who feel alien, despite shared Cypriot heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This lack of shared experience makes finding common ground for reunification increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

In April 2023, intense fighting erupted in Sudan, raising concerns that the nation has been plunged into another civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Unlike previous conflicts, which often stemmed from battles between ethnic groups, the current hostilities are centered on rival factions within the country's military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This internal struggle has significant potential for broader [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | international implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Context of Military Dominance and Conflict

Long-running conflicts can profoundly shape and alter countries, often leading to the militarization of society and the army's growing power in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This dominance can result in military takeovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Similarly, paramilitary bodies can emerge as significant players, sometimes leading to tensions and even outright conflict with the conventional military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Sudan exemplifies such a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Overview of Sudan

Sudan, officially the Republic of Sudan, is located in Northeast Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It spans 1.8 million square kilometers (720,000 square miles), making it the world's 15th largest country and Africa's third-largest state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its borders include Egypt to the north, the Red Sea and Eritrea to the east, Ethiopia and South Sudan to the south, and the Central African Republic, Chad, and [[civil_conflict_and_instability_in_libya_post2011 | Libya]] to the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The population is estimated at around 46 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Although 97% of Sudanese adhere to Sunni Islam, the country is ethnically diverse, with 70% being Arab, and other groups including the Fur, Baja, and Nubians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## [[historical_background_to_sudan_conflict | Historical Background of Sudan's Conflicts]]

Sudan has an exceptionally long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Early History** Partially conquered by ancient Egypt, the area converted to Christianity in the 6th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Muslim Arab forces attempted to push into the region in the 7th century but were initially repelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. By the 17th century, Arab and Islamic influence grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Ottoman and British Rule** In the early 19th century, the Ottoman Empire, with an Egyptian Army, established control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. An uprising in 1881 led Britain to send troops, placing Sudan under British rule while Egypt formally remained sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Under colonial rule, Sudan was divided into two distinct territories: the overwhelmingly Arab and Muslim northern provinces, and the southern provinces, home to various sub-Saharan African groups practicing local religions and Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **First Sudanese Civil War (1955-1972)** After World War II and the onset of decolonization, Sudan's future was uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Southern leaders sought a federal arrangement within an independent, united Sudan or outright independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Rising tensions culminated in rioting and a Southern soldier mutiny in July 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Britain withdrew, and Sudan gained independence on January 1, 1956, immediately plunging into [[historical_context_of_sudans_conflicts | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. A peace agreement in 1972 granted the South extensive autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005)** The peace lasted only a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Following oil discoveries and growing Islamic sentiment, President Jafaar Nimeiry (who took power in a 1969 military coup) broke the agreement, declaring Sudan a unitary Islamic state under Sharia law, sparking the Second Sudanese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The South, better prepared, formed the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which quickly controlled Southern rural areas with support from Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985, and his civilian successor failed to resolve the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In 1989, Omar al-Bashir led a military coup, overthrowing the civilian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Despite the fall of Ethiopia's military dictatorship in 1991, the South Sudanese held on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. By 2000, 20 years of fighting had caused over 2 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### The Darfur Conflict and Peace Process

A significant uprising in the western region of Darfur, sparked by resentment against Arab domination, led to a brutal repression campaign by the military and the local Arab militia, the Janjaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This resulted in accusations of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Confronted with two uprisings and international condemnation, al-Bashir agreed to US-led talks with the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In January 2005, a peace deal was reached, envisioning self-government followed by an independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Six years later, in July 2011, South Sudan became a sovereign state after over half a century of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Efforts were also made to halt the fighting in Darfur, with a UN and African Union peacekeeping force established in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. In 2009, al-Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. To control the Janjaweed, they were transformed in 2013 into the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) under the nominal command of the armed forces but with a separate leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Road to the Current Crisis

While South Sudan's independence ended one costly war, it created new problems for the Sudanese government, which lost crucial oil revenues from the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This economic impact fueled widespread anger against the ruling regime, leading to mass street protests in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. In April 2019, the military intervened, forcing Omar al-Bashir to resign and arresting him after 30 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Hopes for democratic civilian rule were short-lived as the Armed Forces made it clear they would remain in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This sparked further protests, which were violently suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Following international pressure, the military agreed to share power under a joint Transitional Sovereignty Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This council included the Armed Forces Commander, General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, General Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the RSF, alongside a civilian prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, resentment persisted among those who felt their democratic aspirations were thwarted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. New protests grew, leading to another military coup on October 25, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. The Sovereignty Council was dissolved, the prime minister arrested, and power reverted to al-Burhan and Dagalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The takeover was widely condemned, with calls for the transition to civilian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. By December 2022, intensive international efforts seemed to be yielding a deal for a two-year transitional arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, hopes for a final agreement in April 2023 were dashed at the last minute by a growing power struggle within the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## [[factions_within_sudans_military_and_power_struggles | The Power Struggle and Current Conflict]]

Although the military leadership appeared united after the 2021 coup, and the two generals had known each other since the Darfur days, their relationship became increasingly strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Beyond policy differences and personal ambitions, broader social factors played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Many traditional Sudanese elites, largely from the north and northeast, reportedly rejected the idea of Dagalo, a provincial Darfurian, becoming leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Additionally, allegations emerged that Dagalo had amassed significant wealth by appropriating gold mines in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

[[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | International factors]] also contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Al-Burhan was seen as closer to the United States and supported by Egypt, while Dagalo maintained close links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. By early 2023, tensions between the two generals became openly apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Dagalo, harboring strong political ambitions, openly campaigned for support and condemned the 2021 coup as "a gateway for the return of the former regime," portraying al-Burhan as a radical Islamist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

This power struggle erupted into clashes between the Army and the RSF on April 15, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The fighting has resulted in hundreds killed, thousands wounded, and a mass exodus from Khartoum, the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Current Situation and Outlook

The future of Sudan remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Several ceasefires have been brokered but have quickly collapsed, and there appears to be little hope for reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. With Dagalo condemning the army commander and large numbers of troops on both sides, there is a real fear that this is escalating into yet another bloody and protracted [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Many ordinary Sudanese citizens reportedly desire the removal of both generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## International Significance

The fighting in Sudan has garnered significant international media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, even more than the recent two-year civil war in neighboring Ethiopia, which caused over half a million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This is partly due to the thousands of foreigners, particularly Europeans, caught in the fighting, prompting countries like Britain, France, and Germany to desperately try to evacuate their citizens, deploying military units for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

Crucially, there are also critical geopolitical and economic factors at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Despite its poverty and chronic instability, Sudan possesses mineral resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. It serves as an essential strategic gateway between the Middle East and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Furthermore, its Red Sea coastline grants it control over one of the world's most crucial waterways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The alignment of the competing generals with different geopolitical actors—al-Burhan with the United States and Egypt, Dagalo with Moscow—adds another dimension to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. For these reasons, the United States, China, Russia, and the European Union are closely monitoring the situation in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

The outbreak of fighting marks the latest tragic chapter for Sudan, a country that has endured conflict for almost its entire existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This persistent instability has seemingly entrenched the military's role in the nation's politics, leading to the disastrous consequences now unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

For many years, Syria has been considered a pariah state by much of the international community, though there are recent signs of changing relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As a "pariah state," also known as a "rogue state," Syria has sat outside the international order by systematically undermining other countries or subverting global rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Reasons for this status can include exporting revolutionary ideology, launching wars of aggression, developing weapons of mass destruction, committing genocide, or gross [[human_rights_abuses_and_conflict_in_syria | human rights abuses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Syria's modern history of being a repressive dictatorship and a destabilizing actor in the broader [[influence_of_middle_eastern_geopolitics_on_syria | Middle East]] has contributed to this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Context

The Syrian Arab Republic is located in the Middle East, bordering [[the_history_and_development_of_turkeys_political_landscape | Turkey]] to its north, Iraq to its east, Jordan to its south, and Israel and [[history_of_lebanons_political_structure | Lebanon]] to its west, along with a Mediterranean coastline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. With an area of 185,000 square kilometers (71,000 square miles), it is the 87th largest country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Syria's population is estimated at around 21 million, though millions have also fled, primarily to neighboring states like [[the_history_and_development_of_turkeys_political_landscape | Turkey]] and [[history_of_lebanons_political_structure | Lebanon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

While the majority of Syrians are Arab, the country also hosts Kurdish, Circassian, and Turkic communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Approximately three-quarters of the population are Sunni Muslim, with significant minority religious groups, most notably the Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam, who make up an influential 10% of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Historical Foundations

Syria boasts a long and rich history dating back to antiquity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It was once a Roman province before coming under Islamic influence in the 7th century, later serving as a key battleground during the Christian Crusades in the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire conquered Syria, maintaining control until the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Post-WWI, as Britain and France partitioned the Middle East, Syria (including what is now [[history_of_lebanons_political_structure | Lebanon]]) fell under French rule, a mandate confirmed by the League of Nations in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Post-Independence and Political Instability

Syria declared independence during the Second World War and became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It was also one of the six original members of the Arab League, alongside Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, [[history_of_lebanons_political_structure | Lebanon]], and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Early Challenges and Coups
From its inception, the Syrian state faced immense internal problems due to its diverse society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It suffered a significant defeat in 1948 as part of the unsuccessful Arab attempt to destroy the newly created state of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This turmoil led to Syria's first of many military coups in March 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

During this period, the Ba'ath Party emerged as a significant new political force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Built on a left-wing socialist ideology, it championed secular pan-Arab nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### The United Arab Republic (UAR)
Facing a challenge from the Communist Party, Syria sought assistance from Egypt and its leader, Abdul Gamal Nasser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Following separate votes in February 1958, the two countries merged to form the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Nasser's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, this union was short-lived, as Syrians quickly grew discontent with Egyptian dominance. Syria withdrew from the UAR after another coup in September 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Over subsequent years, Syria continued to be plagued by [[syrias_political_instability_and_coups | political instability]], frequent coups, counter-coups, and changes in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## The Assad Era

### Hafez al-Assad's Rise and Rule
In February 1966, a military takeover led to the appointment of a young Alawite Air Force general, Hafez al-Assad, as minister of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Initially, his position seemed precarious after Israel heavily defeated Syria and other Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, which saw Israeli forces seize the Golan Heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. However, Assad managed to retain power and steadily built his influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

In November 1970, Hafez al-Assad launched his own coup and became president of Syria the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. His ascension marked a dramatic shift after a quarter-century of political turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Under [[assad_regime_rise_and_fall | Hafez al-Assad]], Syria became a harsh and repressive regime internally, eliminating all opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He strengthened the armed forces while concentrating political power and state security in the hands of the Alawite minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Externally, he sought to establish Syria as a leading actor in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This involved aligning with the Soviet Union, taking a fiercely anti-American stance, and maintaining an uncompromisingly hardline position on Israel, especially after Egypt made peace with the Jewish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Damascus began supporting militant Palestinian groups, leading to Syria becoming the first country designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department, a status it still holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Syria also sent troops into [[history_of_lebanons_political_structure | Lebanon]] during its civil war, eventually becoming an occupying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Furthermore, it forged close ties with revolutionary Iran, facilitating Tehran's efforts to undermine Israel and assist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. As a result, Syria under Hafez al-Assad was widely regarded as one of the most repressive, dangerous, and destabilizing states in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Bashar al-Assad's Succession and Continued Policies
Hafez al-Assad died on June 10, 2000, after 30 years in power, and was immediately succeeded by his son, Bashar al-Assad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Initially, there were hopes that the new leader, an eye doctor who had lived in Britain before being recalled to Syria in 1994 after his older brother Basil's death, would be a reformer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

However, these hopes quickly faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Bashar al-Assad maintained strict control over domestic politics and continued the country's hardline foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. In addition to opposing Israel's existence, Syria facilitated the travel of militant Islamic fighters to Iraq to join the anti-American insurgency following the 2003 US invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## The Arab Spring and Civil War Onset

Everything began to change with the emergence of the Arab Spring in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Protests erupted in Syria, and the [[assad_regime_rise_and_fall | Assad regime]] responded with a brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This led to widespread international condemnation from the United States, the European Union, and Syria's Arab neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. As it became clear that the crackdown would continue, the Arab League suspended Syria in November 2011 and imposed economic and political sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Despite international efforts to broker peace, the violence escalated, leading to a full-scale [[impact_of_syrias_civil_war_on_international_relations | civil war]] by 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. While Iran supported Damascus, an international coalition against Assad emerged, with military support from [[the_history_and_development_of_turkeys_political_landscape | Turkey]], Saudi Arabia, and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The United States and other Western states recognized the opposition as the legitimate voice of the Syrian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. However, despite allegations of chemical weapon use by Damascus in 2013, the US was reluctant to intervene more openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

By 2015, various Islamist groups, including Al-Qaeda and Islamic State, gained significant ground in the civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, shifting international attention to containing this new threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Simultaneously, Russia intervened to support Assad, fundamentally transforming the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. By 2020, Islamic State was largely defeated, [[the_history_and_development_of_turkeys_political_landscape | Turkey]] had invaded to limit Kurdish power in the north, and Syrian government forces controlled two-thirds of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Current Political Landscape

Today, an effective stalemate exists; though skirmishes continue and the situation remains politically unresolved, the war is effectively over, or at best, a frozen conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Crucially, [[assad_regime_rise_and_fall | Assad]] remains in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This reality has led to increasing suggestions that it is time to accept the situation and re-engage with Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Shifting International Relations
Several countries have begun to openly communicate with Assad, including the United Arab Emirates and Oman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Egypt has also moved to mend relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Most significantly, Saudi Arabia, which strongly opposed Assad at the war's outset, has now joined these states, with reciprocal visits by foreign ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Riyadh has even led calls for Syria's readmission to the Arab League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, a crucial step in [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria's rehabilitation]].

Proponents of engagement argue that despite desires for a change in regime, the [[assad_regime_rise_and_fall | Assad regime]] is secure, and engagement is necessary to address issues such as refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Concerns about Iran's growing regional influence, strengthened by its support for Syria, are also a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Additionally, Syria's emergence as a leading producer of amphetamines to fund its war efforts has created a drug problem in the [[influence_of_middle_eastern_geopolitics_on_syria | Middle East]], prompting states to seek engagement with Damascus to curb this trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Continued Opposition
Despite these efforts, considerable opposition to [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria's rehabilitation]] persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Qatar, for instance, insists that Syria cannot be accepted back until a final political settlement is reached, displaced persons are addressed, and repression ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. As of recently, opposing voices still hold the upper hand, with Arab League foreign ministers deciding against lifting Syria's suspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Nevertheless, efforts continue, with Saudi Arabia planning to invite Assad to the organization's next summit in Riyadh in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

The United States and the European Union remain vehemently opposed to the [[assad_regime_rise_and_fall | Assad regime]], with the EU insisting on no normalization of relations until a political solution to the conflict is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Thus, widespread international acceptance of Syria on the world stage remains unlikely in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. However, moves towards readmission into the community of Arab states signal a significant moment for this long-standing pariah state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

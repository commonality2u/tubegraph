The United States is engaged in crucial negotiations in 2023 to renew key agreements with three small Pacific island nations: the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These talks, while receiving little attention, are vital for securing U.S. national security interests and potentially preserving international peace and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The discussions have proven more difficult than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Concept of Free Association

The modern international system is based on independent sovereign states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, "free association" is a concept that blurs these principles, originally developed to aid decolonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. It allows territories full internal self-government while an outside state manages aspects of their defense and foreign affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Currently, there are five examples of this arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
*   The Cook Islands and Niue, associated with New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   The Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau, in free association with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The fundamental agreements between Washington and these three Pacific countries are up for renegotiation, raising questions about the future of these special relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Geography and Demographics of the Freely Associated States

The Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau span the eastern Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Comprising over 2,000 small islands, their combined land area is approximately 1,350 square kilometers (520 square miles), making them only the 171st largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, their wider maritime boundaries cover about 5.6 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles), granting them the world's seventh-largest exclusive economic zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Their total population is just over 175,000, with approximately 113,000 in Micronesia, 46,000 in the Marshall Islands, and 18,000 in Palau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Their per capita GDP ranges from $3,500 in Micronesia to $12,000 in Palau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Their economies rely on subsistence farming, fishing, and tourism, making them highly dependent on U.S. aid and grants, which can account for up to a third of their annual budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Colonial History of the Pacific Islands

The modern history of these islands began in the 16th century with Spain's expansion into Southeast Asia and the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The Spanish East Indies eventually included the Caroline Islands, Marshall Islands, Palau islands, and Mariana Islands (including Guam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Spanish control ended in 1898 when Spain lost the Philippines and Guam to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Madrid had already transferred the Marshall Islands to German control in the 1880s and subsequently sold the remaining territories to Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

German colonial rule was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. In December 1920, after the First World War, the League of Nations transferred control of the islands to Imperial Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Japanese control lasted only a couple of decades, ending during the Second World War when U.S. forces seized the island chains after brutal fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### U.S. Trusteeship and Nuclear Testing

Following World War II, the islands' future was decided by the Trusteeship Council of the newly established United Nations, which oversaw decolonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In April 1947, the Security Council designated the United States as the administering authority of what became the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Divided into seven administrative districts and initially run by the U.S. Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, the territory gained international prominence in the late 1940s and 1950s as the Marshall Islands became the center for U.S. nuclear weapons testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Starting with explosions on Bikini Atoll in July 1946, the United States conducted 67 tests over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This had a catastrophic environmental and health impact on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Path to Self-Rule and Free Association

As decolonization advanced globally, pressure mounted on the United States to relinquish control over its Pacific island territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. After introducing initial steps toward self-rule in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, Washington offered the islands a choice between formal integration or independence under free association during the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

In 1975, the Northern Mariana Islands voted to maintain ties with the United States, becoming a commonwealth and one of five unincorporated U.S. territories alongside Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The remaining districts chose free association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Four of them merged to form the Federated States of Micronesia in May 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, while the Marshall Islands and Palau rejected membership, becoming separate self-governing republics in 1979 and 1981, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Compacts of Free Association (COFA)

By 1984, the United States and the islands had agreed on the terms of their future relationships under the Compacts of Free Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Under these agreements, the territories became self-governing states with the right to conduct their own foreign affairs, including signing treaties, in consultation with Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Their citizens also gained the right to live and work in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

In return, the United States assumed full authority and responsibility for their security and defense, including the right to block other states from military access to these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The U.S. also committed to providing significant financial assistance for 15 years and allowing the states to participate in certain federal economic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The compacts are subject to regular review and can be terminated by mutual consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Following referendums and U.S. Congressional approval, the compacts with the Marshall Islands and Micronesia came into force in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Despite U.S. recognition of their independence and notification to the UN that the trust territory no longer existed, the Soviet Union blocked formal approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Consequently, these two countries joined the UN in September 1991, after the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Palau's compact was ratified later, and it became a UN member in December 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Geopolitical Importance and Current Renegotiations

The three countries, collectively known as the Freely Associated States, have served as useful partners for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Their relationship secures U.S. control over a significant part of the Pacific and provides military facilities, including an important ballistic missile test site in the Marshall Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. They also offer diplomatic support for Washington on contentious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

In 2003 and 2004, Congress extended the financial assistance elements of the compacts for another 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, amounting to an estimated $229 million for Palau, $1 billion for the Marshall Islands, and $2.1 billion for Micronesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. These are the agreements currently up for renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Challenges in Renegotiation

The renegotiation process, initiated by then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in August 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, has proven difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Beyond agreeing on funding terms and levels, new issues have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. All three countries seek assistance to manage the effects of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, and the Marshall Islands is seeking further compensation for the nuclear tests conducted in the 1940s and 1950s, a request Washington is resisting after having already paid half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China's Influence in the Pacific]]

The significant challenge in these negotiations is [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | the Chinese factor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. As Beijing expands its economic, political, and strategic influence in the region, it has steadily increased its support for the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This poses a major problem for Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

There are concerns that if the talks fail, these states might engage more actively with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This could reduce U.S. influence and potentially lead the Marshall Islands and Palau, two of the remaining 13 UN members recognizing Taiwan, to switch recognition to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Most seriously, fears exist that states could eventually end their compacts entirely, which would eliminate Washington's 'right of strategic denial,' a potential barrier against Beijing's wider military ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

The value of these relationships has been openly acknowledged in U.S. strategy documents for the Indo-Pacific region, which call the Freely Associated States the "Bedrock of the U.S role in the Pacific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Renewed Urgency and Diplomatic Efforts

Despite a slow start, partly due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, the past year has seen a growing sense of urgency. In March 2022, the Biden Administration appointed a Special Presidential Envoy for the negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, and Congress has called for prioritizing the talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

[[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | Chinese efforts]] to gain influence in the region underscore the importance of a new deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. In May 2022, shortly after signing a security pact with the Solomon Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, Beijing proposed a major new security relationship with 10 Pacific Island States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This initiative, despite promising financial incentives and free trade, was reportedly blocked by Micronesia, which termed it "a threat to regional stability," highlighting Micronesia's ongoing value to Washington, even though it has recognized the People's Republic of China since 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Washington has also intensified its efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. In late September 2022, it hosted the first-ever Summit with Pacific island leaders, attended by President Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Blinken also participated in the latest round of compact negotiations with the presidents of the three countries in Washington on September 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Despite these efforts, a final agreement was not reached by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This means 2023 is vital for U.S. efforts to preserve its unique link to these Pacific States, which Washington now considers central to countering growing [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | Chinese strategic influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

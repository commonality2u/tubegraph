The ongoing conflict in Yemen, initially a threat to regional stability, has escalated to pose a global challenge, particularly by interrupting the flow of trade through the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, have disrupted global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The United States has launched a multinational naval task force to address this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, but concerns exist that this could further destabilize peace and security across the Wider Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Strategic Importance of Yemen
The Republic of Yemen is located at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Its strategic location at the confluence of the Red Sea (connected to the Suez Canal), the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean makes it one of the world's most strategically important locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Approximately 30% of the world's container traffic, accounting for about 12% of global trade, utilizes this waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. In 2023, around 24,000 ships passed through the Bab El Mandeb—or "Straight of Tears"—a narrow passageway separating Yemen from Djibouti and Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

Yemen has a population of around 30 million people, primarily Muslim and Arab, but divided into numerous tribal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. A significant religious divide exists, with 30-40% of the population being Shia Muslims, mainly residing in the Northwest, and the rest being Sunni Muslims spread across the South and East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## [[yemens_historical_divisions_and_attempts_at_unification | Historical Divisions and Unification]]
Yemen has a long history, being one of the first areas to adopt Islam in the 7th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The Ottoman Empire established a presence in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Modern history saw the British East India Company seize the port of Aden in 1839, extending British influence over southern sultanates and emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

After World War I, northern areas under Ottoman rule gained independence, forming the Kingdom of Yemen, while the South remained under British Imperial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. By the 1960s, both regions faced instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. As Britain prepared for decolonization, an anti-colonial uprising erupted in the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. In the North, the monarchy was overthrown, leading to a civil war between republicans and royalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

By the end of the 1960s, the situation stabilized:
*   In November 1967, Britain withdrew, and the People's Republic of South Yemen became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   In the North, known as the Yemen Arab Republic, royalists were largely defeated by 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Pressure for unification began immediately, driven by the North's view of British rule as illegitimate and a widespread sense of shared identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. However, hopes for a swift merger were dashed when South Yemen fell under communist rule in June 1969, becoming the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This led to tensions, including border wars in 1972 and 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

Progress towards unification remained slow for much of the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. By the end of the decade, the weakening of the Soviet Union made a deal with the more prosperous North attractive for the impoverished South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Similarly, President Ali Abdullah Saleh of North Yemen (since 1978) faced economic pressures and saw unification as a way to strengthen his political position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. After formal discussions began in April 1988, the two parts united to create the Republic of Yemen on May 22, 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

### Post-Unification Challenges and Civil War (1994)
Despite initial optimism, problems quickly arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. The more populous and prosperous North, with Saleh as president, dominated the new state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. As a result, Southern leaders unilaterally declared independence on May 21, 1994, triggering Yemen's first post-unification civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Although the uprising was suppressed within two months, pro-independence sentiment persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Saleh continued his autocratic rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Descent into Current Conflict (2011-Present)
The situation began to change dramatically in 2011 with the start of the Arab Spring, which saw popular protests erupt in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. After initially agreeing to step down, Saleh reversed his decision but was seriously injured in an assassination attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. In February 2012, after over 30 years in power, Saleh resigned, transferring control to Vice President Abdul Rabu Mansour Hadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

Hopes for a new direction under Hadi were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. His administration faced substantial internal problems:
*   Yemen, already the poorest country in the Arab world, saw its economic situation deteriorate further with high unemployment and food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
*   It faced a growing threat from jihadist groups, including offshoots of al-Qaeda and Islamic State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   A pro-independence movement gained strength in the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

The most severe challenge emerged in the North, where Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthi Movement, had been fighting government forces since 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. The Houthis, created to protect the interests of Yemen's Shia Muslims, received support from Iran as part of its broader efforts to destabilize the Gulf region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

In September 2014, Houthi forces, allied with troops loyal to former president Saleh, seized the capital Sanaa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Within six months, they reached Aden, the new home of the national government, and in March 2015, President Hadi fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

### Escalation and Saudi-Led Intervention
The conflict escalated dramatically at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Fearing that Yemen would fall to Iranian-backed forces, various Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, intervened in March 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. They were supported by prominent Western countries, including the United States, Britain, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. The Saudi Coalition vowed to end the Houthi threat and reinstate Hadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, rapidly retaking much of the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

Government forces also allied with the pro-independence Southern Movement, which was also focused on fighting the Houthi threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. However, this partnership ended in May 2017 when fighting erupted between the allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. The Southern Movement established the Southern Transitional Council (STC) to reclaim independence and seized Aden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Matters were further complicated when the United Arab Emirates withdrew from the Saudi Coalition supporting Hadi and switched its support to the STC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

By 2018, the situation deteriorated sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. After the Houthis launched missiles against Saudi Arabia, Riyadh imposed an air and naval blockade on the heavily populated North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. This resulted in millions needing food and medical assistance, becoming widely recognized as the world's worst humanitarian disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

### Peace Efforts and Current Situation
Despite agreements on localized ceasefires in 2018 to allow aid, the conflict continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. The STC and Hadi government continued to fluctuate between cooperation and conflict; for instance, a Saudi-brokered power-sharing agreement from November 2019 collapsed by mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

By 2022, the situation appeared to shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Under pressure from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Hadi agreed to hand over power to a presidential council, paving the way for a nationwide ceasefire that lasted six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. When fighting resumed, it was at a lower level, opening the way for peace talks between the sides, and specifically between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Even more significantly, a Chinese-brokered peace agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in early 2023 further helped ease tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

Despite positive steps like prisoner swaps, the situation in Yemen remains precarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. The UN notes that two-thirds of the population (around 20 million people) still desperately require humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_yemen_conflict_on_global_trade | Impact on Global Trade]]: Red Sea Attacks
The war in Gaza has posed a significant threat to global trade in the context of the Yemen conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Following the start of the Israeli attack against Hamas, the Houthis announced they would attack any ships destined for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. Several major incidents have occurred, including the hijacking of a British-registered vessel in November 2023 and numerous drone and missile strikes against shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

While many attacks were thwarted by US, French, and British warships, some hit their targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Faced with increasing danger and rising insurance costs, many large shipping companies, including Maersk and Mediterranean Shipping Company (the world's largest container shipping firm), and BP, the oil giant, have suspended operations in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. This interruption to a crucial trade route could have significant [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict | knock-on effects for the international economy]], especially as many countries are working to control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

### International Response and Risks
This threat to global trade prompted the United States to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. On December 18, 2023, it announced the creation of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a new naval task force of ten countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Spain, the Seychelles, and Bahrain, to protect shipping in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

However, the mission crucially does not include any other Red Sea states or Arab states besides Bahrain, where the mission will be based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This highlights a greater problem: concerns that the mission could destabilize the region if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. The ongoing peace talks explain why Saudi Arabia, a crucial Red Sea state, and the UAE have not participated in the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.

There are fears that launching strikes against the Houthis, while justifiable, could upset the delicate situation in Yemen and cause fighting to escalate again, plunging the country back into its brutal civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. Additionally, any direct US attack on the Houthis could prompt Iranian retaliation, with Tehran issuing warnings that the US-led task force will face "extraordinary problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

The United States openly acknowledges the delicate balance required to protect maritime safety without destabilizing the situation in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. For now, the strategy involves shooting down drones and missiles but avoiding direct attacks on the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. However, if the situation escalates further or the broader economic effects become more pronounced, there may be calls for more direct action, which could reignite [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions]] between Saudi Arabia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

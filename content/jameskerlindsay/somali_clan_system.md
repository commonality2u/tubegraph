Despite sharing a joint language, religion, and culture, the Somali people, who are spread across the Horn of Africa, are divided by a highly complex clan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. This system is a central factor in understanding the region's dynamics, including recent conflicts in [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]].

## Structure of the Clan System

The Somali clan system is centered on five main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Within these main clans, there are also many sub-clans and even sub-clans of sub-clans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>.

## Key Clans and Their Locations

*   **Darod** The largest clan group, forming an arc from Kenya in the south, through Ethiopia, [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]], and up to the northern Somali region of Puntland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>.
    *   **Harti Clan** A sub-clan of the Darod, includes the Majeerteen, Dhulbahante, and Wasangeli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:04">[02:39:04]</a>. These are the largest groups in northern Somalia and eastern [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>. The Majeerteen largely inhabit Puntland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:03">[06:18:03]</a>.
*   **Hawiye** Located in eastern Somalia, northern Kenya, and southern Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>.
*   **Rahanweyn** Found in central Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>.
*   **Dir** Predominant in northern [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]] and Djibouti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>.
*   **Isaaq** Constitute the majority in [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:04">[02:28:04]</a>.

## Clan System and Conflicts

Clan tensions have been a persistent issue in the region.

> [!info] Historical Context
> When the British Somaliland Protectorate and the Italian-administered trust territory of Somaliland merged in 1960 to form the Somali Republic, broader clan tensions quickly emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>. In 1961, [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]] was downgraded, feeding Isaaq discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:05">[04:05:05]</a>.
>
> General Mohamed Siad Barre, who took power in a military coup in 1969, attempted to break the power of the clans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:05">[04:23:05]</a>. Opposition to his regime grew, especially in the Isaaq-dominated north, which faced brutal government reprisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:06">[05:10:06]</a>.

### Recent Tensions and Claims

The clan system helps explain current tensions, particularly in the eastern provinces of [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>.

*   **Puntland's Claims** In 1998, Puntland, largely inhabited by the Majeerteen (a Harti-Darod clan), rejected secession from Somalia but called for autonomy within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:02">[06:11:02]</a>. Puntland claimed authority over all areas inhabited by wider Harti-Darod clan members, including significant parts of [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]]'s three eastern provinces (Sool, most of Sanaag, and the south of Toghder, known as Cayn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:04">[06:30:04]</a>.
*   **Local Opposition in Sool** When the president of [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]], a Dir clan member, visited Las Anod in December 2002, it sparked anger among the local Dulbahante inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:04">[07:11:04]</a>. Many in Sool later rejected renewed [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]] control and also Puntland, forming the Khatumo State of Somalia in 2012, which sought self-rule within a federal Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:03">[07:45:03]</a>. Parts of the local Sool leadership rejected a peace deal with [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]] and appealed to Puntland for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:05">[08:26:05]</a>.
*   **Risk of Wider Conflict** The ongoing fighting around Las Anod risks igniting a wider clan confrontation across the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:09">[10:49:09]</a>.

### Complexity of Secession

The situation highlights that secessionist conflicts can be far more complex than just one ethno-national or religious group fighting another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:02">[12:34:02]</a>. Sometimes, communities otherwise united by a single language, culture, and religion can still wish to be apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:07">[12:39:07]</a>. This complexity is evident in the dispute over [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Somaliland]]'s status, where clans within its claimed borders assert their own desires for autonomy or reunification with Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:02">[11:31:02]</a>.

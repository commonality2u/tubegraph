The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]], also known as the Nigerian Civil War, stands out as one of the most brutal and bloody conflicts of modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It resulted in an estimated one million deaths and displaced millions more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. During the late 1960s, the conflict was widely regarded as the humanitarian tragedy of its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, a reputation it maintains when considering the most pressing humanitarian disasters of its day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Pre-War Displacement and Violence

Tensions in Nigeria escalated significantly in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. An attempted coup on January 15, 1966, led by junior military officers predominantly from the southern Igbo ethnic group, resulted in the assassination of 22 senior political and military figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Though the coup was quickly defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, its effects were profound.

In a retaliatory coup on July 28, northern army officers took control of the country, executing several hundred southerners, mostly ethnic Igbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Simultaneously, attacks on Igbo living in the north intensified, leading to the murder of an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This violence triggered a mass exodus, with up to two million Igbo fleeing south to the safety of the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. By this point, the country was in crisis, and discussions of eastern [[biafran_independence_movement | secession]] grew prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Famine and Casualties

After Colonel Ojukwu unilaterally declared the creation of the Republic of Biafra on May 30, 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, the federal government declared war on the breakaway province on July 6, 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

A significant turning point occurred in May 1968, when the Nigerian government gained control of Port Harcourt, effectively imposing a blockade on Biafra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. As a direct consequence, the region suffered a severe famine that led to the deaths of well over a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Over the course of the three-year conflict, it is estimated that well over a million people died, either directly from fighting or indirectly from the famine and illness that arose from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Millions died in a conflict that led to mass starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## International Humanitarian Response

When the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] took place in the late 1960s, it was widely considered the humanitarian tragedy of its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. At a public level, the Biafran cause garnered massive sympathy, particularly after images of starving Biafran children emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This public outcry led to a significant international humanitarian effort known as the Biafran Airlift, which was carried out by various non-governmental organizations and church groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Despite the public sympathy, the majority of the international community, especially African states, supported the Nigerian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. They viewed Biafra's [[biafran_independence_movement | secession]] as an existential threat to their own territorial integrity, given that many had recently gained independence within colonial borders that encompassed diverse ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The Organization of African Unity played a crucial role in rallying regional and international support for Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] left a lasting legacy, shaping contemporary thinking on secession and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Its profound humanitarian impact underscores the tragic consequences of internal conflicts driven by unresolved colonial legacies and ethnic divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

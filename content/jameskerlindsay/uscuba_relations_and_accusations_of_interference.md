In March 2024, protests erupted in Cuba due to severe food shortages and rising energy prices, leading to demonstrations in several cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Following an appeal to the United Nations for emergency assistance, the Cuban government accused the United States of orchestrating these demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While Washington vehemently denies these claims, the incident has brought the strained relationship between the two countries into focus once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The relationship between the United States and Cuba, despite Cuba being a small island and the US being a global superpower, has been long, complex, and often embattled for over 60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Washington has historically viewed Cuba as an existential threat, imposing harsh economic, political, and social restrictions that have been widely condemned internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The US, in turn, regards Cuba as an autocratic single-party state that infringes upon its citizens' democratic and social freedoms, tramples on human rights, and has undermined US interests for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Historical Context of US-Cuba Relations

Cuba, an island nation in the Caribbean, is located approximately 150 km (90 mi) north of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492, Cuba was a central part of the Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere during the 16th and 17th centuries, serving as a staging post for activities in the Americas and a key port for treasure fleets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It became an important agricultural hub for tobacco and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Unlike most of Spain's empire in the Americas, Cuba remained under Madrid's control until the late 19th century, leading to calls for statehood and the Cuban War of Independence in 1895 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. A turning point came in 1898 when a US warship exploded in Havana Harbor, leading Washington to declare war on Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Under the Treaty of Paris, Cuba passed to the United States and gained independence four years later in 1902 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

From its inception, the new country faced political instability, frequent government changes, and revolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The United States maintained considerable influence, establishing a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, which remains under American control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The US also retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs, a power it exercised on several occasions, and American companies controlled significant parts of the Cuban economy, including the vital sugar industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### The Cuban Revolution and Cold War Era

Fulgencio Batista, who led a military coup in 1933, became Cuba's strongman and was elected president in 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. After a period out of power, he staged another military coup in 1952 to retain control, overseeing a brutal and repressive regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This environment set the stage for an uprising led by Fidel Castro, his brother Raul, and Che Guevara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Despite an initial setback in 1956, their guerrilla campaign gained momentum, leading to Batista fleeing Cuba on January 1, 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Six weeks later, Fidel Castro became prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Although Washington initially recognized Castro's government, relations rapidly deteriorated after the new regime nationalized American-owned properties and businesses without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. In response, the US imposed sanctions and a trade embargo, and supported an attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Facing growing economic difficulties and US opposition, Castro turned to the Soviet Union for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

This alliance culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, when Soviet ballistic missile bases were discovered on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. A 13-day confrontation brought the world to the brink of nuclear war before the crisis was diffused with an agreement to dismantle missile bases in Cuba and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Over the next two decades, the US remained steadfastly opposed to Castro, viewing a significant communist presence on its doorstep as a challenge to its authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Cuba, meanwhile, provided military and political assistance to rebel groups and left-wing governments across Latin America and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Cuba's dependence on the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact allowed it to maintain a good standard of living despite the US [[impact_of_the_us_embargo_on_cuba | economic embargo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Post-Cold War Developments

Everything changed with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, leaving Cuba without its primary benefactor and facing significant hardships including food, medicine, and fuel shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Havana implemented austerity measures and took initial steps to open its economy to tourism, investment, and private enterprise, but Castro retained tight control under his one-party system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Washington, supported by a large Cuban exile community, hardened its stance against the Castro regime, condemning the country's lack of democracy and restrictions on human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Congress passed legislation further isolating Cuba and allowing punitive action against governments and companies doing business with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This, however, led Cuba to become increasingly self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Towards the end of the Clinton Administration in the late 1990s, Washington adopted a new approach, easing travel restrictions and encouraging people-to-people contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This détente was short-lived, as the Bush Administration (2001) reinforced the embargo and reimposed travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

In 2008, Fidel Castro stepped down after nearly 50 years, replaced by his brother Raul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The election of Barack Obama in 2009 paved the way for a thaw in relations, focusing on engagement rather than isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The two countries began cooperating on issues like drug trafficking and migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This led to a historic breakthrough in 2014, with Cuba and the United States announcing normalization of relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Embassies reopened in Havana and Washington, travel restrictions were eased, and Cuba was removed from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, the embargo remained in force, requiring Congressional approval for its lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This new relationship proved short-lived. The Trump Administration (2017) reversed many of these steps and tightened the long-standing embargo, citing human rights violations and Cuba's support for Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. While the Biden Administration was expected to resume engagement, especially after Raul Castro stepped down in April 2021, ending 60 years of Castro family rule, there was no return to the Obama-era détente <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Although some travel restrictions were eased, the core of the embargo remained due to continued US concerns over human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Current Tensions and Accusations

In the meantime, tensions escalated in other ways. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba maintained good relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This became prominent with the start of the war in Ukraine in early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While Cuba abstained from the General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion, Moscow and Havana increased their economic, political, and military cooperation in the face of Western sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Reports of Cubans signing up for the Russian army further stoked tensions, though Havana insisted it was not part of the war and opposed such recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Adding to the strain, a former US ambassador was arrested in December 2023, charged with spying for Cuba over many decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### [[cubas_economic_crisis_and_protests | Cuba's Economic Crisis and Protests]]

The current situation stems from a combination of factors. Cuba has entered its most severe [[cubas_economic_crisis_and_protests | economic crisis]] since the end of the Cold War, heavily impacted by the pandemic, global inflation, fuel shortages, and the ongoing [[impact_of_the_us_embargo_on_cuba | US embargo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. On March 1, 2024, the government imposed a 500% fuel price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The country also faces growing shortages of vital items like baby milk and medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, leading Havana to make an urgent and unprecedented plea to the United Nations World Food Program for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Cuba has also experienced waves of power outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Widespread anger in response to these problems culminated in reports of protests in Santiago de Cuba, the country's second-largest city, and other towns and villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. While Cuban officials claim steps are being taken to address the issues, these demonstrations have further heightened tensions between Havana and Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Accusations of Interference

The Cuban government summoned the most senior US diplomat in the country to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, directly accusing the United States of instigating the unrest and interfering in Cuba's internal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Washington officially denied any involvement, calling the accusations "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. However, American officials also called on Havana to show restraint, making it clear that Washington supports the Cuban people's right to democracy and fundamental freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

Both sides frame the protests as part of a larger, long-term struggle for the Cuban people's right to self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. For Havana, it is about a powerful neighbor with a long history of interfering in Cuban affairs and imposing a harsh embargo for daring to oppose its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For Washington, the confrontation is about efforts to end a "crumbling one-party Communist regime" that has deprived Cubans of their democratic and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Outlook on [[prospects_for_political_change_in_cuba | Prospects for Political Change]]

It remains uncertain whether the current unrest will be contained or if it marks the beginning of a more substantial challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. While Cuba has a history of quelling dissent, historical events elsewhere indicate that such situations can escalate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

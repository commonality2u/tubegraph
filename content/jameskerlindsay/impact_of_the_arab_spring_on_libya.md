In 2011, the world observed as [[muammar_gaddafis_regime_and_overthrow | Colonel Muammar Gaddafi]], Libya's long-time leader, was captured and executed by rebel forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite initial hopes for a new era of stability, these aspirations quickly faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Libya subsequently collapsed further into [[civil_conflict_and_instability_in_libya_post2011 | civil war]], leading to widespread suffering among its population and becoming a significant source of instability across North Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This outcome has led to claims that the elimination of Gaddafi was, in fact, a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Libya's Recent Political and Economic History

Prior to the Arab Spring, Libya, located in North Africa, had been experiencing a period of reintegration into the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Gaddafi's Rule and International Re-engagement
[[muammar_gaddafis_regime_and_overthrow | Muammar Gaddafi]] seized power in a 1969 coup, overthrowing the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. He immediately began transforming the country internally with a highly devolved form of populist socialism combined with strict adherence to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He also radically transformed its foreign policy by moving against Western influences, closing US and British bases, expelling Jewish and Italian communities, and nationalizing the oil industry in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Gaddafi's regime openly supported various Arab militant groups and other terrorist organizations worldwide during the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Following attacks by Libyan agents on Western targets, the United States launched a bombing attack on Gaddafi's compound in Tripoli in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, which was retaliated by the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, which Gaddafi had relied on, changed his fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. His regime faced UN sanctions after two Libyan agents were indicted for the Lockerbie bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. By the late 1990s, with sanctions biting, Libya began a significant foreign policy shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Gaddafi agreed to hand over the Lockerbie bombing suspects and pay compensation for a British policewoman killed in 1984, leading to his welcome back into the international fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The fall of Saddam Hussein after the US invasion of Iraq further prompted Gaddafi to pledge to give up his efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This resulted in the US and the European Union rebuilding relations with Libya, which then gained a seat on the UN Security Council and chaired the African Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Arab Spring Uprising and International Intervention

### Outbreak of Protests
Despite this progress, everything changed in December 2010 with the outbreak of the Arab Spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. As widespread protests spread across the region, toppling leaders in neighboring Egypt and sparking an uprising in [[impact_of_syrias_civil_war_on_international_relations | Syria]], demonstrations erupted in Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. A brutal crackdown by security forces fueled public anger and led to high-profile defections, but Gaddafi vowed to remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Escalation and Intervention Calls
Opposition to Gaddafi's regime rapidly grew, with various groups forming the Transitional National Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. As violence escalated, the United Nations imposed sanctions on the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Although the opposition initially secured the country's east and appeared poised to take the capital, Gaddafi's forces managed to regain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. At this critical stage, Britain and France called for direct [[international_intervention_and_its_consequences_in_libya | intervention]], proposing a no-fly zone over the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. While other Western states, including Germany and the United States, initially urged caution, the Arab League supported the measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. As a result, the UN Security Council voted in favor of military measures to halt the fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### NATO Strikes and Gaddafi's Overthrow
By the end of March 2011, NATO had begun missile and airstrikes against Libyan forces loyal to Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Britain, France, and Italy also sent military advisers to assist the rebels, even as diplomatic efforts continued for a peaceful resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. These actions led to the opposition forces breaking through and taking Tripoli in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The Transitional National Council gained international recognition as the country's lawful government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Gaddafi, who had fled the capital, was finally captured and killed by rebel forces on October 20, 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Post-Gaddafi Instability and Civil War

### Immediate Aftermath and Second Civil War
Although many hoped for a fresh start for Libya, the disparate groups that had overthrown Gaddafi soon turned on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. In 2014, this erupted into another full-scale conflict, known as the Second Libyan [[civil_conflict_and_instability_in_libya_post2011 | Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The Government of National Accord (GNA) in the west clashed with the forces of the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### External Involvement and Ongoing Challenges
The situation was further complicated by the involvement of various outside actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. While the United Nations and most Western states recognized the GNA (which had strong Turkish support), many countries, including Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, aligned with the LNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Beyond these major factions, the country became a magnet for Islamist organizations, including ISIS, with various indigenous groups also fighting for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This was tragically highlighted in September 2012 when the US ambassador to Libya was murdered by militants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

In October 2020, nine years of war formally concluded with a permanent ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. However, though the fighting has stopped, the situation remains precarious, and presidential elections meant to follow have not yet occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Consequences and Debate

### Devastating Impact
The post-Arab Spring events have taken a massive toll on Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Once considered one of Africa's wealthiest countries with considerable social welfare programs, Libya has been decimated politically, socially, and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Tens of thousands have been killed, and millions displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### The Intervention Debate
A significant point of contention for many observers is how Western states quickly shifted from accepting, and even supporting, Gaddafi to fully endorsing regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This debate has played out in Western policy circles and has been a source of wider international criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. In 2016, Barack Obama stated that the failure to plan for Gaddafi's overthrow was the most significant foreign policy failure of his presidency, though he still stood by the decision to oust the Libyan leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Others have been more scathing, arguing that the overthrow of Gaddafi has been a disaster for Libya and for international security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The ousting of Gaddafi, similar to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, raises crucial questions about the conduct of international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. While Gaddafi was undoubtedly a despotic and quixotic leader whose regime had been a persistent state sponsor of terrorism, he had also been attempting rapprochement and had been brought back into international society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The Libyan case, like Iraq, should prompt observers on both sides of the intervention debate to carefully consider how to respond to unstable autocrats in the international system and the broader effects of removing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

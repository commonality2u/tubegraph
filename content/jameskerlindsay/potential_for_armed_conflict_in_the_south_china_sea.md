Concerns about the [[increasing_military_activity_in_the_south_china_sea | increasing military activity]] around the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea have grown in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has led to renewed worries about the possibility of an armed conflict in an area where no less than six different actors have territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Observers believe that the Spratly Islands may become the focus of a full-scale armed confrontation between China and many of its neighbours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:03">[01:55:03]</a>.

## The Spratly Islands Dispute

The [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly Islands]] are a collection of over a hundred tiny islets, reefs, and atolls, many of which are wholly or partially submerged, and largely uninhabited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. At most, 20 are considered significant, with the largest being Itu Aba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. Although the islands themselves are small, they cover a vast area of approximately 400,000 square kilometres (160,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.

### Strategic Importance
The value of the Spratly Islands is military, economic, and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>. Controlling the territory allows countries to control the territorial waters and undersea resources across much of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:45">[02:45:45]</a>. This includes:
*   Control of one of the world's most important shipping lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:53">[02:53:53]</a>.
*   Access to significant fishing banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>.
*   Potential access to believed oil and gas deposits around the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>.

Control over these small territories can come with significantly extended maritime and airspace rights over a large area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

### Claimants
The Spratly Islands have been disputed for over a century, with tensions steadily growing over the past few decades as China has become more forceful with its claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>.
Six parties claim the islands, either in whole or in part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>:
*   China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>
*   Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>
*   Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>
*   The Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>
*   Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>
*   Brunei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>

Although Indonesia does not claim the islands, it has publicly challenged China's claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:26">[10:26:26]</a>.

## Historical Context of Claims

The islands' history is believed to date back almost 2,000 years, having been first discovered by Chinese fishermen and later mentioned in Imperial Chinese records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>. At that time, they were understood to be an extension of the Paracel Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>.

European encroachment began in the 16th century, with Spain formally claiming the territory and building a lighthouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a>. In the 19th century, other European colonial powers, such as France and Britain, also laid claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:47">[03:47:47]</a>. During the Second World War, Imperial Japan seized the territory until its defeat in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:12">[04:12:12]</a>.

After WWII, the question of sovereignty over the islands became hotly contested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:20">[04:20:20]</a>.
*   In 1947, the Republic of China (Taiwan) published a map indicating the Spratly Islands were part of Chinese territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>.
*   The Communist People's Republic of China, established in 1949, also claimed the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:39">[04:39:39]</a>.
*   Vietnam and the Philippines, both independent states, also claimed sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:53">[04:53:53]</a>.

## Escalation of Tensions and Militarization

The issue took on a more dangerous dimension when various countries began establishing small military presences on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:03">[05:03:03]</a>.
*   Taiwan set up an outpost on Itu Aba in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:14">[05:14:14]</a>.
*   Vietnam and the Philippines created footholds in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:20">[05:20:20]</a>.
*   In 1974, Chinese and South Vietnamese naval forces clashed over the Paracel Islands, resulting in over 70 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:31">[05:31:31]</a>.
*   Malaysia claimed part of the territory in 1983, followed by Brunei in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:39">[05:39:39]</a>.
*   In 1988, violence erupted when China forcibly removed the unified Vietnamese military presence in the Battle of Johnson South Reef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:01">[06:01:01]</a>.

Following this, Beijing began an ambitious scheme to reclaim land around reefs and atolls to create artificial islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:13">[06:13:13]</a>. China dramatically increased these activities in 2013, reclaiming an estimated 13 square kilometres (five square miles) of land over the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:23">[06:23:23]</a>. China's assertive claim led to pushback, including the United States sending a warship to the area in October 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:36">[06:36:36]</a>.

## The Permanent Court of Arbitration Ruling

In 2013, the Philippines referred China's claims to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:56">[06:56:56]</a>. Manila argued that Beijing had no right to claim sovereignty over the islands based solely on history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:09">[07:09:09]</a>. Instead, any claim should be judged based on the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:15">[07:15:15]</a>. China refused to participate in the proceedings and disputed the court's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:25">[07:25:25]</a>.

The court did not decide on sovereignty, as land territories are not subject to UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:36">[07:36:36]</a>. Instead, it decided which states had a claim to rights within the waters and on what grounds â€“ whether historical relationship or international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

### Court's Findings Against [[chinas_historical_claims_versus_international_law_in_the_south_china_sea | China's Historical Claims]]
In a detailed ruling, the Court ruled against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:16">[08:16:16]</a>:
*   It argued that rights to the maritime zones should be based on UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:22">[08:22:22]</a>.
*   China's actions, including land reclamation, had aggravated the situation and infringed on the Philippines' rights within its exclusive economic zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:27">[08:27:27]</a>.
*   The court ruled that none of the Spratly Islands were "islands" as understood under UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:41">[08:41:41]</a>. Therefore, even if China had sovereignty, it would not confer an exclusive economic zone that would infringe on the rights of other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:53">[08:53:53]</a>.
*   It called on both parties to comply with the Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:08">[09:08:08]</a>.

China refused to accept the ruling, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson calling the arbitration case "pure political drama" orchestrated by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:13">[09:13:13]</a>. China also refuses to take the ownership issue before another legal body like the International Court of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:30">[09:30:30]</a>.

## Continued Tensions and Recent Incidents

Tensions have continued to rise as Beijing steadily builds up its presence on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:40">[09:40:40]</a>. China has constructed military bases on three of the islands, despite earlier assurances from President Xi Jinping that China would not militarise the territory further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:47">[09:47:47]</a>.

Several other claimants have also become more active, demonstrating the [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict | role of regional actors in the South China Sea conflict]]:
*   [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam]] has reportedly begun dredging parts of the territory, creating around 220 hectares of new land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:03">[10:03:03]</a>.
*   Malaysia retains control of a reef it captured in the 1980s, which has since been turned into an island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:12">[10:12:12]</a>.
*   Brunei is the only claimant without a presence on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:19">[10:19:19]</a>.

Most recently, in February 2023, the Philippines Government filed a complaint after a Chinese Coast Guard vessel allegedly shadowed, harassed, engaged in dangerous manoeuvres, and directed a military-grade laser at one of its vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a>. The Philippines accused China of threatening its sovereignty and security, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. suggested that the Armed Forces of the Philippines must reorient their mission against Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. He characterized the Spratly Islands issue as more difficult and complex than the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:15">[11:15:15]</a>.

## Outlook for Conflict

The dispute is exceedingly complex due to the multiple countries claiming some or all of the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:24">[11:24:24]</a>. While UNCLOS provides clarity, a resolution model based on it would effectively exclude China and Taiwan, creating a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:34">[11:34:34]</a>.

The potential for conflict hinges on how far China is willing to push its highly disputed claim and how far other states are prepared to defend their positions, potentially facing an armed confrontation with Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:48">[11:48:48]</a>. While international attention is often focused on the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the Spratly Islands may be a more likely focal point for conflict in the period ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:03">[12:03:03]</a>. With the sheer number of actors involved, this small collection of rocks, reefs, and atolls has the potential to become the center of a bitter regional war if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:15">[12:15:15]</a>. The situation highlights the broader [[geopolitical_tensions_over_strategic_waterways | geopolitical tensions over strategic waterways]] in the region.

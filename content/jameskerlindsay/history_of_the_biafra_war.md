Nigeria gained international attention in early June 2021 when it banned Twitter. This action followed the platform's removal of a tweet from the Nigerian president that referenced the 1960s [[the_significance_and_impact_of_the_biafran_war | Biafra War]] and implied the government might again use force to suppress rising separatist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident highlighted the enduring significance of the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran independence movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict

When an attempted secession is defeated, the territory is often reincorporated, and the country moves forward with little or no further talk of separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, in some cases, resentment can linger, and the campaign may resurface decades later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran independence campaign]] in southeast Nigeria is a significant example of a resurgent secessionist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

In the late 1960s, Nigeria fought one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | history]] to quell the self-proclaimed Republic of Biafra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Over two and a half years, millions of lives were lost before the breakaway territory was defeated and re-incorporated into the federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Yet, over 50 years later, pro-independence sentiment is again rising, posing a risk of a return to serious conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the continent's most populous country, with around 200 million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While it comprises numerous ethnic groups, the most significant are:
*   The predominantly Muslim Hausa and Fulani in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The Christian and Muslim Yoruba in the southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   The predominantly Christian Igbo, based in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Colonial Origins

The story of Biafra begins with [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | British colonisation]] in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Initially divided into two distinct colonies—the Muslim-dominated Northern Nigerian Protectorate and the predominantly Christian Southern Nigerian Protectorate—the two were merged in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. In 1954, the country was formally constituted as a federation of three regions, broadly aligned with the main ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:
*   The Hausa-Fulani dominated Northern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   The Yoruba-dominated Western Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   The Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Four years later, in 1960, Nigeria officially became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Escalation to War (1966-1967)

Tensions soon emerged after independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Following disputed elections, a military coup was launched by southern officers in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This resulted in the assassination of many leading political figures, including the popular premier of the Northern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

In reprisal attacks, thousands of ethnic Igbo living in the north were murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Over a million others fled south to the safety of the Eastern Region, which in turn prompted calls for the territory to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Although a deal for a looser federal arrangement was purportedly reached between the Eastern leadership and the federal government in early 1967, the federal government appeared to renege on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. They announced a plan to divide the country's three regions into 12 new parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This was seen as a clear attempt to undermine the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Consequently, the region's leader, Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, declared independence on May 30, 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## The Biafran War (1967-1970)

Just under six weeks after Biafra's declaration of independence, the Nigerian government launched a full-scale invasion to suppress the secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The ensuing conflict, known as the Biafran War or the Nigerian Civil War, became a [[the_humanitarian_crisis_during_the_biafran_war | humanitarian catastrophe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

As well as those killed in the fighting, it is estimated that between one and three million people died of hunger due to supplies to the breakaway region being cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. By January 1970, the Nigerian government, supported by key [[international_responses_to_the_biafran_secession | international allies]] including Britain and the Soviet Union, had defeated the last pockets of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. On January 15, 1970, the Republic of Biafra ceased to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Post-War Era and Resurgence of Sentiment

In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the Federal Government called for national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. General Yakubu Gowon, the country's leader, famously declared there were "no victors and no vanquished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This led to a policy centered on the "Three R's": reintegration, reconciliation, and reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For a time, the scale of defeat and traumatic war memories seemed to keep Igbo independence sentiment in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

However, by the late 1990s, this began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The passage of time meant new generations emerged with no direct experience of the conflict, and memories faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Deeper roots for the resurgence included a persistent feeling among the Igbo that they faced hostility and discrimination, despite the official "Three R's" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. They felt systematically shut out of key jobs and highest political offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Additionally, many argued that the government deliberately neglected economic development in the region, providing lower levels of federal funding and few infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Another issue was the emergence of conflict in the Niger Delta in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Though the Delta, much of which was claimed by Biafra, became Sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil-producing region, little revenue reached local communities, who instead experienced extensive environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

This sense of marginalization, coupled with exploitation and repression in the Delta, appeared to kickstart the revival of the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran independence movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Key Movements and Leaders

*   **Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB):** Established in 1999 to lead efforts to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. In 2005, MASSOB membership was outlawed, and its leader, Ralph Uwazuruike, was arrested in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB):** Founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, a charismatic figure based in Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. His media outlet, Radio Biafra, has become a leading voice for the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   In October 2015, Kanu was arrested during a trip to Nigeria, facing charges of sedition and treason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. His supporters protested, leading to violence and harsh repression by government forces, including the "deliberate use of deadly force" according to Amnesty International <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   Kanu was eventually released on bail in April 2017 and left Nigeria, which strengthened IPOB's standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   Later that year, the Nigerian Government officially designated IPOB as a terrorist organization, though Kanu insisted it was dedicated to peaceful means for a referendum on Biafran independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Recent Tensions

The start of current tensions can be traced back to 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>:
1.  **Election of President Muhammadu Buhari:** A former general and military ruler from the Muslim North, he intended to focus on areas that supported him and crack down on insurgencies and separatist movements, including pro-Biafran organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Arrest of Nnamdi Kanu:** (detailed above)

Since then, tensions in the southeast have been driven by the "Herder-Farmer Conflict" or "Herder War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Climate change has led to increased desertification in the north, pushing Muslim Fulani cattle herders south into lands held by settled farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This conflict has resulted in over 10,000 deaths and tens of thousands displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. As herders encroached on Igbo territory, President Buhari, himself a Fulani, has been accused of not doing enough to stop the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Following deadly clashes in late 2020, IPOB announced the establishment of an armed wing, the Eastern Security Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Although IPOB insists this was to fend off herder attacks, it has led to further violence with government forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This rising violence sparked President Buhari's tweet that was later removed, leading to Nigeria's decision to ban Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Current Challenges for the Movement

The independence movement faces fierce opposition from the Federal Government and a number of internal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>:
*   **Internal Divisions:** Opinion within the Igbo community is divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. While the movement enjoys growing support among disaffected youth, the Igbo establishment, particularly older members who remember the war, are far more cautious or even opposed to independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Unclear Boundaries:** It is unclear what the boundaries of a Biafran state would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Some supporters advocate for the inclusion of all areas claimed in the 1960s, while others focus on a core group of Igbo-dominated states in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This is significant because many non-Igbo in those areas wish to remain part of Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Focusing on smaller areas would leave any Biafran state as a landlocked enclave within Nigeria and exclude most of the key oil-producing areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

There seems to be little immediate likelihood that the government will bow to demands for a referendum on independence or permit secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Instead, facing growing separatist challenges elsewhere, it seems determined to continue its efforts to suppress Biafran independence sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Fears are growing that IPOB's new militancy could lead to an increasingly violent phase in the independence campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The case of Biafra demonstrates that the end of a secessionist conflict does not always mean the end of a secessionist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Fifty years after one of modern times' most brutal separatist conflicts, the [[biafran_independence_movement | movement for an independent Biafra]] is once again gaining ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Stoked by a deep sense of marginalization and government neglect, and fueled by internal tensions exacerbated by conflicts seemingly linked to climate change, there is a real sense that tensions in Biafra will continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The key question is how the Nigerian Government will respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. While many concrete steps could address the situation, the president's recent threats, deemed serious enough by Twitter to be removed, raise the prospect that the government is not planning to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This suggests a potential return to serious violence in southeast Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While a new [[the_significance_and_impact_of_biafran_war | Biafran War]] seems unlikely, a major new Biafran conflict is certainly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

In recent months, there has been renewed discussion about the potential unification of Kosovo with neighboring Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This idea has been openly raised by two former prime ministers of Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the logic behind such a move may seem understandable, it faces significant obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Background

[[kosovo_declaration_of_independence_and_international_response | Kosovo's declaration of independence]] in February 2008 led to a split in international opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The United States and most of the European Union recognized its independence, but many other countries, including Russia and China, remain steadfastly against its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Consequently, Kosovo remains outside the United Nations, and its aspirations of joining the European Union are on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Against this backdrop, senior Kosovan political figures have increasingly discussed the option of unification with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Albin Kurti, the leader of VetÃ«vendosje and winner of recent elections in Kosovo, stated in February that he supports the idea and would vote for unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Similarly, Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister, indicated that if Kosovo's European integration hopes remain blocked, there might be no choice but to hold a referendum on unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, this suggestion carries various [[political_and_legal_challenges_to_kosovoalbania_unification | legal and political implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Geographic and Demographic Context

Kosovo and Albania are located in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Albania**: Measures 29,000 square kilometers (11,000 square miles), making it the 140th largest of the 193 United Nations members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Its current population is 2.9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The vast majority of its population is ethnic Albanian, with Greeks being the largest ethnic minority, comprising one or two percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Kosovo**: At 11,000 square kilometers (4,200 square miles), it is roughly a third the size of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Its population stands at 1.8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The most recent census showed that 93% of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The remaining seven percent are predominantly Serbs, alongside smaller communities of Montenegrins, Bosniaks, Roma, and other groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Both countries also have extensive diaspora populations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## [[Historical context of Albanian territories | Historical Context of Albanian Territories]] and [[Historical background of Kosovos political status | Kosovo's Political Status]]

The origins of the current situation trace back to 1913, when the borders of a new Albanian state were demarcated under the Treaties of London and Bucharest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This demarcation resulted in almost half of the region's Albanians living outside the new Principality of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The largest concentration of these was in the Kingdom of Serbia, which included most of what is now Kosovo and North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, with others in Montenegro and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This separation led to different paths for Albanians in Albania and elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

In 1918, Serbia and Montenegro became part of what would later be Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. After the Second World War, both Albania and Yugoslavia came under communist rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Initial good relations between them deteriorated, leading to increasing estrangement, particularly after Albania adopted an extreme isolationist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This changed in 1991 with the collapse of the communist regime in Albania and the disintegration of socialist Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. While this fostered greater contact between Albania and Albanian communities across the region, political union remained elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

In late 1991, Macedonia (now North Macedonia) gained independence, placing half a million Albanians within a new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. A similar situation occurred for the small Albanian community in Montenegro following its independence in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The most significant development was Kosovo's attempt to break away from Serbia to become an independent state, like other former Yugoslav republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Following an escalation of fighting, NATO intervened in March 1999, placing Kosovo under United Nations administration pending a decision on its final status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. After failed UN talks, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in February 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This move was supported by the United States and most of the European Union but opposed by Serbia, Russia, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Since then, over half of the United Nations members have recognized Kosovo as an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Reasons for Current Unification Discussions

Several factors underlie the current discussions regarding unification:

### [[National identity and aspirations of Albanians | National Identity and Aspirations]]
Many view the unification of all Albanian territories, often referred to as 'Natural Albania' or 'Greater Albania,' as the [[national_identity_and_aspirations_of_albanians | national aspiration]] of the Albanian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, some prefer to focus on closer unity between Albania and Kosovo, as they are overwhelmingly Albanian countries with the free will to unite, rather than an overtly expansionist message claiming all Albanian areas in North Macedonia or Southern Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama is a key proponent of closer unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. In recent years, Kosovo and Albania have strengthened political ties, holding joint cabinet sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Rama has appointed Kosovo Albanians to senior government positions in Albania and proposed ideas for open borders and even a joint presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, leading to claims of "unification by stealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Practical Realities and [[International relations and recognition of Kosovo | International Recognition]]
For others, the idea of unification is driven by practical realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The pace of [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | recognitions for Kosovo]] has slowed significantly, with only one country (Israel in late 2020) recognizing it since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Simultaneously, Serbia's diplomatic campaign has led to some countries withdrawing their recognitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. More importantly, Kosovo's path to full [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | international acceptance]] and United Nations membership is blocked by Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Unifying with Albania would indirectly grant Kosovo full participation in the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Pressure for EU Integration
Talk of unification also serves as a means to apply pressure to countries to unblock Kosovo's path to EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This process is stalled due to opposition from five EU members that do not recognize Kosovo, and a general concern about Western Balkan enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Prominent suggestions for unification, such as those by former president Hashim Thaci and former prime minister Ramush Haradinaj, have directly linked the idea to the European Union's failure to provide Kosovo with a clear European perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Feasibility of Unification

### Popular Support
While unification appears popular on the surface, a deeper look reveals a mixed picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A 2010 poll showed overwhelming support for 'Greater Albania' (including Albania, Kosovo, and Albanian-inhabited parts of North Macedonia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. However, support for a union of *just* Kosovo and Albania dropped to 34% in Albania and 29% in Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

A more recent 2019 poll indicated higher support for unification at 75% in Albania and 64% in Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Yet, this support fell to 29% in Albania and 44% in Kosovo when people were asked if they would pay a tax to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This suggests that practicalities significantly influence support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Many Kosovo Albanians fear a secondary position if the national heartland became Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The form of union (unitary state, federation, or confederation) would also need to be clearly defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### [[Legal and political arguments regarding Kosovos independence | Constitutional and Legal Challenges]]
Even with political and popular support, unification appears almost impossible due to constitutional barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Article 1 of Kosovo's constitution explicitly outlaws union with another state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While a constitutional amendment is possible, it would require a two-thirds vote in the 120-member Kosovan parliament, including two-thirds support from the 20 members representing national minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Of these, 10 are ethnic Serbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It is highly implausible that any of them, let alone six, would vote for unification with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. From this perspective, the question of unification is an emphatic "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### [[International relations and conflicts influenced by Kosovo | International Response]]
If, hypothetically, the constitutional votes were secured, the [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | international community]] would likely intervene to prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Countries that do not recognize Kosovo's independence would view such a move as a violation of Serbia's territorial integrity and unlawful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

The challenge also extends to countries that *have* recognized Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. While under normal circumstances, they might support the democratic will of sovereign states to unite, the wider context is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The primary fear is that unification would trigger a chain reaction across the Western Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. If Kosovo and Albania united, it could lead to pressure for unification from Albanians in North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Furthermore, if Albanians were granted the right to unite, it could prompt calls from Serbs in the region for the same, posing a challenge to Bosnia and Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The countries that supported Kosovo's independence did so with the explicit understanding that it would be the end of redrawing borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Any attempt by Kosovo and Albania to unify would lead to enormous pressure from the United States and the European Union on Pristina and Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_kosovo_on_other_separatist_movements | impact of Kosovo on other separatist movements]].

## Conclusion

Recent suggestions by senior Kosovan political figures regarding a vote on unification have garnered international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. However, it seems highly improbable that such a union would occur, at least in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While the idea may appeal to many in an abstract sense, any practical attempt to implement it would likely fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Apart from constitutional blockages, it would face fierce opposition from the broader international community, including both states that do and do not recognize Kosovo's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Such discussions are likely a strategic maneuver to encourage greater [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | international engagement]] to resolve the deadlock over Kosovo's international standing as an independent state, rather than a genuine intention to abandon that independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Nevertheless, the longer Kosovo remains in limbo, the louder these calls for unification may grow, potentially tempting politicians to act despite the severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has gained a reputation as one of the world's most dangerous and unstable countries, having been marred by conflict and violence for the last 30 years, resulting in millions of deaths and displacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Throughout this period, [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] has been a critical actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A recent UN report accused Kigali of supporting an insurgency in eastern Congo, highlighting this ongoing involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Nature of Conflict

Conflicts are inherently complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While traditionally viewed as either interstate wars (between two countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> or intrastate conflicts (civil wars between factions within a country) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, the lines between these forms often blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A civil war can become a proxy conflict for outside parties or spill over to spark conflict with a neighboring state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The DRC serves as a tragic example of this complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. After a brutal initial war upon its creation, 30 years later, it again faced devastating conflict that drew in many of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Although a peace deal was signed around the turn of the millennium, the country has rarely found lasting peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Congo and Rwanda: A Stark Contrast

The Democratic Republic of Congo lies at the heart of Africa, surrounded by nine countries: Zambia, Angola, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Rwanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. At 2.3 million square kilometers (900,000 square miles), it is the 11th largest country globally and the second largest in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, with an estimated population of 100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

In contrast, [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] is tiny, at just 26,300 square kilometers (10,200 square miles)—barely one percent the size of Congo—and has a population of 13.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Despite its size, [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] has played a significant role in the developments within the DRC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, with a 2023 UN expert panel blaming it for destabilizing its neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Historical Context

The Congo and the African Great Lakes region, known for their natural beauty and diverse wildlife, also possess a tragic [[history_of_colonialism_in_the_congo_and_surrounding_regions | history of exploitation, abuse, and conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This history is rooted in the late 19th-century European scramble for Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

*   **Colonial Rule**: Germany took control of what is now Tanzania, Burundi, and [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]], while Belgium seized the Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This marked the beginning of a horrific period of colonial rule, characterized by atrocities and widespread human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Ruanda-Urundi**: During World War I, Belgium also took control of the German territory of Ruanda-Urundi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This territory was administered under a League of Nations mandate and later a UN trust territory, separate from the Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Belgian rule here was equally brutal and included a "divide and rule" policy between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Post-Independence Challenges

The end of Belgian colonial rule had devastating consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

*   **DRC Independence**: The Congo gained independence in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Unprepared for self-governance, it was immediately plunged into a brutal two-and-a-half-year civil war as the resource-rich province of Katanga attempted to secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. In 1965, Joseph Mobutu, the army commander, overthrew the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Under Mobutu's dictatorship, the country (renamed Zaire in 1971) became increasingly impoverished and corrupt due to the plundering of its [[congos_resource_wealth_and_geopolitical_tensions | resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Rwanda and Burundi**: [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] and Burundi also faced immense problems after gaining independence in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. In [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]], the Belgian-supported Tutsi regime gave way to Hutu majority control, leading many Tutsi to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. In Burundi, a Hutu-led rebellion in 1972 resulted in government forces killing an estimated 300,000 Hutu, an event many refer to as a "forgotten genocide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## The First Congo War (1996-1997)

The various regional tensions converged in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. While Mobutu had maintained power for 30 years, largely supported by Western anti-communist sentiment during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, the collapse of the Soviet Union weakened his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The catalyst for Mobutu's downfall originated in [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. In April 1994, the assassination of [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]]'s Hutu president, following growing Hutu-Tutsi tensions, sparked a genocide that claimed over 800,000 Tutsi lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Tutsi-led rebel forces eventually overthrew the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

As the remnants of the Hutu regime fled into Zaire and began to regroup with Mobutu's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] and its ally, Uganda, backed Laurent Kabila, a leading Congolese political opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This culminated in a full-scale invasion of the DRC in October 1996, initiating what is known as the [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | First Congo War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The conflict was short, with Mobutu's forces defeated by May 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Kabila restored the country's name to the Democratic Republic of Congo, signaling an end to Mobutu's dictatorial rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## The Second Congo War (1998-2003)

Hopes for democracy and stability were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Kabila faced criticism for his authoritarian approach and resistance to foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He ordered Rwandan and Ugandan forces to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Their refusal led to [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]], Uganda, and Burundi turning against Kabila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | conflict proliferated]] as Kabila gained new allies from neighboring states, including Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. With [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] and Uganda also turning on each other, this became known as the Great War of Africa, or Africa's World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Although peace talks in 1999 led to a UN peacekeeping mission, fighting continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The conflict ended with Kabila's assassination in 2001 and his son, Joseph, taking power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A new peace process in 2002 finally ended the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

The [[rwanda_and_congo_conflict | conflict's effects were devastating]], costing over three and a half million lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Post-2002 Challenges and the Rise of M23

Under a transitional government led by Joseph Kabila, the DRC began to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Foreign troops departed, and insurgents were integrated into the Congolese armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Kabila was re-elected president in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. While the economy improved, underlying political problems persisted, and Kabila faced accusations of corruption and subverting democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

The most severe challenges emerged in the east of the country, in the North and South Kivu provinces, bordering [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Despite the official end of the war, numerous insurgent groups continued to fight for control of vital [[congos_resource_wealth_and_geopolitical_tensions | resources]] or against the Congolese or Rwandan governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:01]</a>.

### The Emergence of M23

The most significant of these groups, [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]], emerged in 2012 when mutinous Congolese soldiers formed a new militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This militia, primarily composed of Congolese Tutsi, was supported by the Rwandan government, which was still fighting distant Hutu groups based in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

This support was soon halted due to international pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Amid reports of mass atrocities by [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]], the United States and the European Union pressured [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] to cut its ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. A peace deal in 2013 committed the Congolese government to security sector reforms and the integration of [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]] members into the national armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This led to a significant drop in fighting intensity, though other insurgent groups, including offshoots of Islamic State and the Lord's Resistance Army, continued to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

In 2018, the DRC held its first free and fair power transfer in 60 years, with Felix Tshisekedi becoming the new president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Latest Tensions and Ongoing Conflict

As the DRC prepared for presidential elections in late 2023, concerns about the security situation in the East grew again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

The roots of the latest problem trace back to November 2021, when [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]] resumed its activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The group claimed the DRC government had failed to reintegrate its fighters into the national army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]] quickly gained control of significant territory in the east, causing hundreds of deaths and displacing 200,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The Congolese government accused [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] of supporting [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]], a claim vehemently denied by [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. However, an expert UN panel supported these accusations in an August 2022 report, claiming [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] was not only aiding [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]] but also had Rwandan troops operating in the DRC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

To defuse the escalating crisis, the East African Community (EAC), which includes both the DRC and [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]], convened talks in late 2022, leading to [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]] agreeing to a ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Despite hopes for reduced tensions, the latest UN group report, published in June 2023, reiterated that [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] was still supporting [[role_of_m23_and_fdlr_in_congo | M23]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. While the Rwandan government continues to deny the claims, the report has been endorsed by the three Western members of the UN Security Council: Britain, France, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Outlook

The situation has fueled speculation about a new war between the DRC and [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. In a practical sense, they are already at war, with their armed forces and proxies fighting each other in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. It is hoped that international pressure can prevent further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Regardless of whether a formal interstate war emerges, [[potential_humanitarian_crisis_in_central_africa | Eastern Congo]] remains one of the most dangerous and unstable war zones globally, with over 100 militias still operating in and around the border between the DRC and [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

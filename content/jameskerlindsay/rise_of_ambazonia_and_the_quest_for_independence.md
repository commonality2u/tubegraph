The [[The Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] is one of Africa's most serious conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It has caused thousands of deaths, displaced hundreds of thousands, and directly affected millions more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This conflict emanates from the [[colonial_legacy_and_its_impact_on_cameroons_conflict | legacy of colonialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Since 2017, fighting between English-speaking pro-[[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | independence]] armed groups in the west and the French-speaking central [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] has intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Historical Context

Cameroon is located in West Africa, covering 475,000 square kilometers (180,000 square miles), making it the 53rd largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its population is around 26 million, composed of numerous ethnic groups speaking an estimated 24 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The two official languages are French and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. While the majority speak French, approximately 20 percent of the population are primarily English speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The origins of the conflict trace back to the 19th-century Scramble for Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Germany established its most significant imperial holding in the territory of Kamerun, which included present-day Cameroon and parts of the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, and Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. German control was confirmed at the Berlin Conference in 1884 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

During the First World War, Britain and France seized and divided Kamerun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. France took about 80 percent, while Britain took the remaining 20 percent, bordering British Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The League of Nations confirmed Britain's control over the British Cameroons in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Administered from Nigeria, the British Cameroons were split into Northern and Southern Cameroons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Decolonization and Unification

As decolonization began after the Second World War, both British and French Cameroons became UN Trust Territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. On January 1, 1960, the French Cameroons gained [[secession_and_independence_mount_in_africa | independence]] as the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The two parts of the British Cameroons were offered two options: join independent Nigeria or unite with the Republic of Cameroon; full independence was not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Referendums were held on February 11, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>:
*   The Northern Cameroons, predominantly Muslim, voted 60 percent to join Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This occurred on May 31, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   The Southern Cameroons voted 70 percent to join the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The UN endorsed this result on April 21, 1961, leading to talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Although contested by Anglophone Cameroonians who argue results were never formally confirmed, it was determined the two parts would unite as a federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. On October 1, 1961, the Southern Cameroons joined what became the Federal Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Erosion of Anglophone Autonomy

The relationship between the Anglophone and Francophone parts of the new federation soon deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Despite some Anglophones holding senior office, such as John Foncha who became prime minister and vice president, the Anglophone community felt overpowered by the French-speaking majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The first president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, established a highly centralized federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

A decade later, on May 20, 1972, a referendum abolished the federation, granting more powers to the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The Anglophone region, divided into the North West and South West provinces, saw its powers continually decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. In 1982, Paul Biya replaced Ahidjo, further eroding the region's autonomy and changing the country's name back to the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Emergence of Independence Calls

Against this backdrop, various groups from the English-speaking regions convened the first All Anglophone Conference in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. They issued a declaration calling for the restoration of the 1961 federal constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Anglophones also began campaigning internationally, with former prime minister Foncha advocating for a return to autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

In 1994, the Conference repeated its demands, warning of a declaration of [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | independence]] if their concerns were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. However, the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] instead amended the constitution, removing the last vestiges of decentralization, and initiated a crackdown on what it termed [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | separatism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This led to arrests and sporadic violence, though political unrest seemed largely quelled by 2000, with pro-[[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | independence]] activity continuing for much of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## The Anglophone Crisis and Ambazonia's Rise

The current phase of the [[cameroons_anglophone_crisis | Anglophone Crisis]] began in late 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Protests erupted over the increasing number of French speakers assigned to schools and courts in the region, leading to another government crackdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This rapidly escalated into violence as armed groups retaliated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

On October 1, 2017, the anniversary of the Southern Cameroons' incorporation into Cameroon, several groups announced the creation of an independent Federal Republic of Ambazonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The name "Ambazonia" derives from Ambas Bay, where a short-lived British protectorate emerged in the 19th century around a missionary settlement of freed slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

While many pro-[[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | independence]] organizations favored a [[efforts_for_a_peaceful_settlement_in_cameroons_anglophone_regions | peaceful process]], the Cameroon [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] launched a major armed campaign against dissent in November 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This led to growing militancy among several groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. By mid-2019, the situation was highly unstable, with clashes between [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] forces and [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | separatists]], and civilians increasingly targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Thousands had been killed, and over half a million displaced, with tens of thousands fleeing to Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Anglophone militias also targeted schools, viewing them as a tool for the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] to impose French; estimates suggest 80 percent of schools in Anglophone regions were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Attempts at Resolution and Continued Conflict

In 2019, as fighting spilled into Francophone areas, threatening civil war, President Biya announced a 'Major National Dialogue' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Many Anglophone groups dismissed this as a propaganda effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Proposed measures included:
*   Special status for the two Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
*   Election of local governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   Reintegration of fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   Restoration of the country's name to the United Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>
*   Relaunch of infrastructure projects in English-speaking regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

These proposals offered some increased autonomy but fell far short of federalism or full [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | independence]], which many Anglophones now demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. International observers also deemed them insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

In 2020, reports emerged of secret ceasefire talks in July between the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] and prominent jailed pro-[[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | independence]] figures, including Julius AyukTabe, who had been proclaimed the first president of Ambazonia before his arrest and life sentence for terrorism and [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Despite growing international calls for dialogue and internal pressure for a [[efforts_for_a_peaceful_settlement_in_cameroons_anglophone_regions | peaceful settlement]], fighting has continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. On October 24, 2020, armed fighters attacked a school, killing several children, an act condemned by the UN Secretary-General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

There are growing claims of serious and systematic human rights abuses by both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Pro-[[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | independence]] militias are accused of kidnapping and using child soldiers, while [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] forces face accusations of extrajudicial killings, torture, and cruel punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The death toll and number of displaced continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The [[The Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] is a tragic example of how peoples with different historical experiences and cultural traditions were forced into a single state, leading to conflict when one group asserted authority over another and abandoned the political system established at independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. A federal settlement guaranteeing extensive autonomy to the Anglophone community was an obvious and potentially acceptable solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, positions have become polarized, with many Anglophones, fundamentally mistrusting the central [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]], now committed to realizing an independent Ambazonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The central [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]], meanwhile, is determined to retain the territory, despite decades of repression leading many English-speaking Cameroonians to no longer wish to be part of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

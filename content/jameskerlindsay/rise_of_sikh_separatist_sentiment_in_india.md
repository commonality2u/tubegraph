Over the course of 2023, there have been growing fears about the rise of [[modern_developments_and_figures_in_sikh_separatism | Sikh separatist sentiment]] in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This sentiment, fed by charismatic preachers, led to a massive manhunt as Indian authorities cracked down on the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The battle for an independent Sikh state has a long and notoriously violent past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, shaped by brutal massacres and even leading to the assassination of an iconic leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## What is Sikh Separatism?

Globally, many groups seek independence based on ethnolinguistic or religious identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. In India, a significant example is the long-standing campaign within the Sikh community to establish a national homeland known as [[historical_context_of_sikh_separatism_and_khalistan_movement | Khalistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This goal gained wider attention recently when Indian police arrested a leading figure in the pro-independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## India and the Sikh Population

India is the seventh largest country globally by land area, measuring 3.9 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It operates under a federal system, divided into 28 states and eight union territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. With an estimated population of 1.4 billion, India is the most populous country in the world, having recently overtaken China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The country is highly diverse ethnically, linguistically, and religiously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While Hindus form the majority, other religious groups include Muslims, Buddhists, and Sikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

There are approximately 22 million Sikhs in India, with an additional 3 million living worldwide, particularly in Canada, Britain, the United States, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While Sikhs are a small minority of India's overall population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, they constitute almost 60% of the population in Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Punjab is located in northern India, bordering Pakistan and near the disputed region of Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Sikhism and Persecution

The Sikh faith was founded in 1469 with the birth of Guru Nanak near Lahore, in present-day Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Guru Nanak preached a monotheistic religion, [[historical_context_of_sikh_separatism_and_khalistan_movement | Sikhism]], which combined elements of Islam and Hinduism, focusing on inward meditation, moral conduct, and charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. After Guru Nanak, nine more gurus refined the faith until the death of Guru Gobind Singh in 1708 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Early Sikhs faced persecution from the Muslim Mughal Empire, leading to the execution of two gurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Attacks from neighboring Afghanistan also resulted in many Sikh deaths and repeated destruction of their most important shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This persecution fostered a strong sense of community, cemented by the Khalsa, and led to the community becoming increasingly militarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. As the Mughals weakened, Sikhs formed their own political entity, the Sikh Empire, in the late 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## British Rule and Partition

The Sikh Empire's existence changed with the expansion of British Imperial control in India in the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Two fierce wars in 1845 and 1848 resulted in British forces prevailing and bringing the area under imperial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Afterward, Sikhs formed a close relationship with British authorities, with hundreds of thousands serving in the British Indian Army during the First and Second World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Following World War II in 1945, Britain agreed to decolonize India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Due to growing tensions between the country's two central religious communities, India was controversially partitioned, creating a Muslim state, Pakistan, in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Calls for a separate Sikh state were rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Punjab was divided, and most Sikhs in Pakistan relocated to the Indian-controlled eastern part of the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Post-Independence Developments (Pre-1984)

As a minority within a predominantly Hindu country, calls for greater cultural and political rights grew among Sikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Opinion was divided: some desired a fully independent and sovereign Sikh state, [[historical_context_of_sikh_separatism_and_khalistan_movement | Khalistan]], while others sought a separate Sikh-majority Punjabi federal state within India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The latter was granted in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, but due to India's highly centralized political system, it fell short of expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

By the 1970s, tensions escalated with increasing confrontations and calls for greater self-rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Elements within the extensive [[international_dimension_and_responses_to_sikh_separatism | Sikh diaspora]] became more vocal about an independent Sikh homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This culminated in 1980 with the creation of the National Council of Khalistan by Jagjit Singh Chohan, a former Punjabi Finance Minister and exile leader based in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## The Events of 1984

The issue of an independent Punjabi Sikh state gained worldwide attention in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Amid growing [[international_dimension_and_responses_to_sikh_separatism | international support]] for independence and escalating unrest in India, reports indicated Sikh militants were fortifying the Golden Temple complex under their charismatic leader, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

On June 1, 1984, after imposing a media blackout on the province, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered troops to storm the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This operation, known as [[impact_of_operation_blue_star_and_1984_antisikh_riots | Operation Blue Star]], lasted a week and became a bloodbath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The Indian government claimed 500 militants (including Bhindranwale) and 80 Indian soldiers were killed, but Sikh groups dispute this, claiming thousands died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Parts of the Golden Temple complex were also severely damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

These events had huge implications months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. On October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge for the temple storming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This, in turn, triggered [[impact_of_operation_blue_star_and_1984_antisikh_riots | anti-Sikh rioting]] across India, leaving almost 3,500 people dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Impact and Decline of the Movement

The events of 1984 had profound, though differing, effects on the Sikh community in India and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Internationally, it ignited Sikh sentiment, attracting many to the independence cause and fueling the [[historical_context_of_sikh_separatism_and_khalistan_movement | Khalistani movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This also led to one of the world's worst terrorist attacks: the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight from Toronto by Sikh separatists, killing all 329 on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

However, within India, the militant independence movement began to weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. While groups like Babbar Khalsa continued attacks, their potency diminished as Indian police continued their crackdown, and the broader movement fractured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. By the turn of the millennium, the armed campaign was seemingly finished, and many Sikhs appeared disillusioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Jagjit Singh Chohan, the exile leader, was pardoned and returned to India, where he died in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

The passage of time also tempered feelings within the [[international_dimension_and_responses_to_sikh_separatism | diaspora]], and the movement seemed to be slowly petering out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This decline was aided by an increasingly aggressive clampdown on Sikh militants by [[international_dimension_and_responses_to_sikh_separatism | Western governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. For example, in 2001, Britain proscribed Babbar Khalsa as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Recent Developments (2018-2023)

Renewed militancy was reported in Punjab in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Soon after, the Indian government banned a U.S.-based group, Sikhs for Justice, accusing it of destabilizing the country's peace, unity, and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. While some suggested India's longtime foe, Pakistan, was behind the tensions, others pointed to rising poverty in Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Punjab, once one of India's wealthiest states with a successful farming sector, had been steadily declining, leading to social problems and major protests in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

It was during this period that a new pro-independence figure, [[modern_developments_and_figures_in_sikh_separatism | Amritpal Singh]], emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Singh conspicuously modeled himself on Bhindranwale, the militant commander killed in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. He came to lead a group called the Heirs of Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. In February 2023, hundreds of his supporters stormed a jail following the arrest of a group member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Fearing the emergence of an increasingly militant pro-independence group, police launched a massive hunt for Singh the following month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This hunt ended peacefully on April 23, 2023, when Singh was arrested in a village in central Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. He has since been detained under India's National Security Act, which allows prisoners to be held for up to a year without charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Outlook and International Implications

For now, it seems a new wave of violence and pro-separatist sentiment is unlikely, at least within India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Notably, there were no widespread protests following Singh's arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, and many observers insist most Indian Sikhs oppose violent separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Nevertheless, fears of a return to the past persist, and police remain cautious, asserting Singh could still be dangerous if released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Internationally, the effects of these developments are being felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The Indian government has raised concerns over the security of its diplomatic missions in Canada following protests outside its Consulate in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Additionally, a new government commission report in the United Kingdom highlighted a growing pro-[[historical_context_of_sikh_separatism_and_khalistan_movement | Khalistan]] extremist element within the British Sikh community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. While a violent new phase of [[modern_developments_and_figures_in_sikh_separatism | Sikh separatism]] in Punjab seems unlikely, these events demonstrate that the idea of an independent Sikh homeland retains its appeal both in India and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | conflict]] in Myanmar, sparked by the military's overthrow of the democratic government in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, is a highly complex affair involving a wide range of internal and external actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. International involvement has manifested through condemnation, support for specific groups, and attempts at mediation.

## International Condemnation and Recognition

The refusal of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to accept the 1990 election results, which were won by the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), was widely condemned [[role_of_international_community_in_the_conflict_resolution | internationally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Aung San Suu Kyi, a co-founder of the NLD and daughter of General Aung San, was placed under house arrest and awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, an act of significant international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Later, the NLD government, including Aung San Suu Kyi, faced widespread [[role_of_international_community_in_the_conflict_resolution | international condemnation]] for defending the military's brutal treatment of [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic minorities]], particularly the Rohingya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Many observers saw this as a sign that pro-democracy sentiment in Myanmar did not extend to national minorities, but was rather aligned with majoritarian [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic]] Burmese nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Role of China

[[myanmars_geopolitical_context_and_relationships | Neighbouring China]] has also played a role, appearing to throw its support behind the Three Brotherhood Alliance, an alliance of [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | rebel groups]] that launched Operation 1027 in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This support is linked to the Alliance's fight against organised crime gangs based along the Chinese border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Beijing has become increasingly alarmed by a growing internet scam industry that has resulted in over 100,000 Chinese nationals being trafficked into Myanmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Mediation Efforts

Despite the complex nature of the [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | civil war]] and its deep roots in [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic insurgencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, there have been attempts at resolving the [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | conflict]]. [[role_of_international_community_in_the_conflict_resolution | Political talks]] to end the [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | conflict]] have been held under Indonesian auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

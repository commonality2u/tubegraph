The modern world map is largely defined by borders that originated from [[impact_of_european_colonialism_on_somalia | European colonialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Over centuries, imperial powers from Europe extensively carved out vast territories across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, often exploiting their natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Decolonisation and Border Principles

As decolonisation accelerated in the mid-20th century, the question of these inherited boundaries became a critical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. To prevent widespread territorial conflicts, it was broadly agreed that these colonial boundaries would become the borders of newly independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This principle has been largely respected, leading to remarkably few postcolonial border disputes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. New states generally adhered to their colonial boundaries with neighbours, even if they were not always amenable to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Case Study: Venezuela-Guyana Border Dispute

Despite the general acceptance of colonial boundaries, severe disputes have occasionally arisen, sometimes escalating into armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. One prominent example is the ongoing border dispute between Venezuela and Guyana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Historical Background
The origins of this dispute trace back to the Spanish imperial conquest of the Americas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Venezuela, a former Spanish captaincy-general, became an independent sovereign state in 1830 following the collapse of the Spanish Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Meanwhile, other European powers, including the Netherlands, established a colonial presence in South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. During the Napoleonic Wars, three Dutch colonies – Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo – were seized by France and then Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. In 1814, the Dutch recognized British sovereignty over these territories, which were merged in 1831 to form British Guiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Tensions emerged between Venezuela and British Guiana early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Venezuela asserted that the disputed area had been Spanish territory and its borders were undecided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. In contrast, Britain commissioned a survey claiming most of the territory up to the Orinoco River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. By 1841, Venezuela counter-claimed sovereignty over all land west of the Essequibo River, encompassing two-thirds of British Guiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The dispute escalated, leading Venezuela to break off diplomatic relations with Britain in 1887 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The United States interceded, prompting Britain to agree to judicial resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In 1897, the issue was referred to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. On October 3, 1899, the court ruled, awarding a portion of the territory to Venezuela but most of the area between the rivers to Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Venezuela accepted the outcome, and a formal border was established in 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Resurfacing of the Dispute
For six decades, the issue seemed resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, in 1962, as the United Kingdom prepared to grant independence to British Guiana, Venezuela resurrected the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Venezuela argued that the 1899 decision was "null and void" as it was reached behind its back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Despite efforts to settle the matter through a new commission after Guyana's independence in 1966, and later through UN Good Offices, no agreement was reached over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The situation significantly changed in 2015 following the discovery of oil in the disputed Essequibo region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### International Court of Justice (ICJ) Involvement
In 2018, after five decades of failed discussions, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, decided that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) should determine the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Guyana referred the case to the Court on March 29, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Venezuela initially refused to participate, questioning the Court's jurisdiction, but the judges affirmed their authority in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Escalation and Modern Implications
The dispute has escalated rapidly in recent months, with fears of war between Venezuela and Guyana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Venezuela has become more outspoken, increased its military presence, and held a consultative referendum on the issue, which included questions about abandoning the ICJ case and authorising unilateral measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This has been interpreted as a direct threat to invade and annex the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

The ICJ unanimously called on Venezuela to refrain from actions modifying the situation under Guyana's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Despite this, Venezuela pressed ahead with the vote, announced annexation of the territory, and distributed new maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Guyana views Venezuela's actions as an "existential threat" and has engaged in intensive diplomatic contacts with regional partners and [[impact_on_international_relations | international actors]], including the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The issue has also been referred to the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Broader [[impact_on_international_relations | Impact on International Relations]]
A military attack by Venezuela would fundamentally violate [[role_of_international_law_in_border_conflicts | international law]] and lead to an international outcry, likely resulting in economic and political sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. However, without the threat of a military response, Venezuela might believe it can weather condemnation, similar to how Russia might expect its annexations to be eventually accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

If Venezuela's potential invasion proceeds with relative impunity, it would represent another significant blow to the accepted global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. A successful invasion could encourage other states to challenge seemingly settled borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This previously obscure border dispute could thus become another step in fundamentally reshaping [[international_relations_and_state_borders | international relations]] in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The [[Cameroons Anglophone Crisis | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] is recognized as one of Africa's most serious conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It has resulted in thousands of deaths, displaced hundreds of thousands, and directly impacted millions of lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The conflict stems from the [[Colonial legacy and its impact on Cameroons conflict | legacy of colonialism]] and decisions made during decolonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Since 2017, the violence between English-speaking pro-independence groups and the French-speaking central government has escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Efforts to find a peaceful resolution have been made, but progress remains elusive.

## Early Calls for Autonomy and Federalism

The distinct historical and cultural experiences of the Anglophone regions led to early demands for the restoration of their autonomy.
*   **All Anglophone Conference (1993)**: Groups from the English-speaking regions convened and issued a declaration calling for the restoration of the 1961 federal constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **International Campaign**: Former Prime Minister John Foncha, who initially led the Southern Cameroons into the union, began campaigning internationally for the region's autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   **Threat of Independence (1994)**: The Conference reiterated its demands in 1994, insisting that a declaration of independence would follow if their concerns were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

Instead of addressing these concerns, the government further centralized power by changing the constitution, effectively erasing the last vestiges of decentralization, and launched a crackdown on what it considered separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This led to significant arrests and sporadic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. By 2000, political unrest seemed largely quelled, though pro-independence political activity persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

## The 'Major National Dialogue' of 2019

The current phase of the [[The Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon | crisis]] began in late 2016, ignited by protests against the increased posting of French speakers to schools and courts in the Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The government's subsequent crackdown led to rapid escalation into violence as armed groups retaliated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

In 2019, as fighting began to spill into neighboring Francophone areas and civil war loomed, President Paul Biya announced a 'Major National Dialogue' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Anglophone Reaction
> Many Anglophone groups largely dismissed this dialogue as a "stage managed propaganda effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

The dialogue proposed several measures:
*   Granting special status to the two Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>
*   The election of local governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>
*   Reintegration of fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>
*   Restoration of the country's name to the United Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>
*   Re-launch of major infrastructure projects in the English-speaking regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>

> [!NOTE] Insufficiency of Proposals
> While these proposals indicated some movement towards increased autonomy, they fell significantly short of a restoration of federalism or the full independence that many Anglophones now desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Even many international observers deemed the proposals insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Secret Ceasefire Talks (2020)

As the situation continued to worsen, the government appeared to consider a political settlement in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Reports emerged of secret ceasefire talks held in July with prominent jailed pro-independence figures, including Julius AyukTabe, who had been proclaimed the first president of [[Rise of Ambazonia and the quest for independence | Ambazonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. AyukTabe had been arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for terrorism and secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. However, the government later denied these reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

## Ongoing Stalemate and Calls for Dialogue

Despite growing international calls for dialogue and pressure from internal opposition groups for a peaceful settlement, there has been no cessation of fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. The [[Humanitarian Impact of the Crisis in Cameroon | death toll]], displacement, and general impact on millions continue to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

The situation is described as tragic because a federal settlement, guaranteeing extensive autonomy to the Anglophone community, was considered an obvious solution that many Anglophones seemed willing to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. However, positions have become polarized, with a fundamental mistrust of the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. Many within the Anglophone community are now committed to realizing an independent [[Rise of Ambazonia and the quest for independence | Ambazonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. Meanwhile, the central [[Government and Separatist Dynamics in Cameroon | government]] remains determined to hold onto the territory, despite decades of repression and efforts to diminish Anglophone political and cultural autonomy, leading many English-speaking Cameroonians to no longer wish to be part of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

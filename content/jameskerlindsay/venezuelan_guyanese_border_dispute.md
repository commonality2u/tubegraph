As 2023 concluded, fears escalated regarding [[venezuelas_intentions_to_annex_guyanese_territory | Venezuela's preparations to invade neighbouring Guyana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Decades of tensions over a disputed border persist, despite an ongoing case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the world's highest court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Caracas appears increasingly intent on [[venezuelas_intentions_to_annex_guyanese_territory | seizing the disputed territory by force]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Colonial Origins of Borders

The world map is extensively shaped by borders created through European colonialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. European imperial powers, over centuries, carved out vast territories in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, often exploiting their natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. With decolonisation in the mid-20th century, the question of these boundaries emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. To avoid endless territorial conflicts, it was generally agreed that colonial boundaries would become the borders of newly independent states, a principle largely respected with remarkably few postcolonial border disputes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, severe disputes have sometimes arisen, occasionally leading to armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The border between Venezuela and Guyana is one of the most significant current examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Geographic and Demographic Context

*   **Venezuela**: The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is located in South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It spans 96,000 square km (approximately 350,000 square miles), making it the world's 32nd largest country, with a population of around 28 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Guyana**: The Cooperative Republic of Guyana is also in South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It covers 25,000 square km (around 83,000 square miles), ranking as the world's 83rd largest country, with a population of just 800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Historical Genesis of the Dispute

The history of the dispute begins with the Spanish imperial conquest of the Americas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Venezuela, initially part of the Vice-Royalty of New Granada, [[venezuelas_political_history | became a separate captaincy-general in 1777]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. As the Spanish Empire collapsed, it [[venezuelas_political_history | joined the new Republic of Colombia in 1819]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. A decade later, it broke away, [[venezuelas_political_history | becoming an independent sovereign state in 1830]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Meanwhile, other European powers, including the Netherlands, established colonial presences in South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. By the late 18th century, Dutch holdings were reduced to a few colonies off the north coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. During the Napoleonic Wars, three of these – Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo – were seized by France and then Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. In 1814, the Dutch ceded sovereignty to Britain, and in 1831, these territories merged to form British Guiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Tensions immediately emerged between Venezuela and British Guiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Venezuela argued the area had been Spanish and borders were undecided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Britain, after commissioning a survey, claimed most of the territory to the Orinoco River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1841, Venezuela protested, counter-claiming sovereignty over all land west of the Essequibo River, an area covering two-thirds of British Guiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The dispute escalated, leading Venezuela to break off diplomatic relations with Britain in 1887 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The United States interceded, calling on London to accept judicial resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Britain initially refused but changed its stance after the U.S. Congress threatened to establish a boundary commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. In 1897, the issue was referred to arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. On October 3, 1899, the court issued its decision, awarding a portion of the territory to Venezuela but most of the area between the rivers to Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Despite disappointment, Venezuela accepted the outcome, and a formal border was marked in 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. For six decades, the issue appeared resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Resurrection of the Dispute

In 1962, as decolonisation accelerated and the UK prepared to grant independence to British Guiana, Venezuela suddenly resurrected the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Arguing that the 1899 decision was reached "behind its back," it refused to accept the ruling, calling it "null and void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Britain and Venezuela agreed to examine the circumstances but couldn't settle the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. They decided a new commission would be created after Guyana's independence to search for a practical settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Crucially, they also agreed that if this failed, the UN Secretary-General would determine a settlement mechanism under Article 33 of the UN Charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Guyana became independent on May 26, 1966, joining the UN shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The commission established failed to reach an agreement by its mandate's end in 1970, and further high-level talks in the 1980s also proved unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. In 1990, the UN offered its Good Offices (a form of light mediation), but despite many attempts over decades, the sides remained far apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Shift to ICJ and Oil Discovery

The situation changed radically in 2015 following the [[impact_of_oil_wealth_on_venezuelas_economy | discovery of oil in Essequibo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. In 2016, then-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced a final one-year intensive mediation effort, which also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. As a result, in 2018, the new UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, determined that peaceful negotiated solutions had been exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. After five decades of discussions, he announced that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) should determine the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Guyana referred the matter to the ICJ on March 29, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Venezuela initially refused to participate, arguing the Court lacked jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, in 2020, the judges decided they had the authority to hear the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. After public hearings in November 2022, the Court issued its first ruling six months later, rejecting Venezuela's claim that Britain should be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. A final ruling is not expected until mid-2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Recent Escalation (2023)

While waiting for the ICJ ruling, the situation on the ground has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. [[impact_of_oil_wealth_on_venezuelas_economy | Guyana, with the world's highest per capita oil deposits, has undergone rapid economic development, becoming one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. [[impact_of_oil_wealth_on_venezuelas_economy | This contrasts sharply with Venezuela, where President Nicholas Maduro's populist policies have led to economic collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Consequently, Caracas has become more outspoken about the border issue, accelerating this process in the latter half of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Venezuela increased its military presence along the frontier, constructing a new military airstrip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. On October 23, Venezuela announced plans for a consultative referendum on the issue, addressing five questions, including whether to abandon the ICJ case and authorise unilateral measures to resolve the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Many interpreted the latter as a [[venezuelas_intentions_to_annex_guyanese_territory | direct threat to invade and annex the territory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Guyana immediately appealed to the ICJ for provisional measures to deter Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. On December 1, the Court unanimously called on Venezuela to refrain from modifying the situation in the area under Guyana's control and urged both sides to avoid actions that could aggravate the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Despite the ruling, Venezuela proceeded with the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Although turnout was reportedly low, the measures passed by a vast majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Maduro hailed the result as a "total success" for Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Within days, Venezuela announced it had annexed the territory, distributing new maps showing 'Guayana Esequiba' as part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It also ordered foreign offshore energy companies to cease operations within 90 days and instructed its own oil producers to prepare to work in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Ominously, troops were moved closer to the frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

Guyana's tone rapidly changed, with President Mohamed Irfaan Ali calling Venezuelan actions an "existential threat" and initiating intensive diplomatic contacts with regional partners and international actors, including the United States, which expressed full support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Guyana also referred the issue to the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The UN Secretary-General has called for calm and reiterated support for peaceful settlement of disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Potential Geopolitical Consequences

While Venezuela is solidifying its claim, the question of actual invasion remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Observers note that what started as a populist stunt has become more serious, indicated by Brazil moving its forces closer to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Any [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | military attack would fundamentally violate international law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The territory is internationally accepted as belonging to Guyana, and an invasion would [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | lead to an international outcry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. While many countries and actors, including the U.S. and E.U., would likely impose economic and political sanctions, it is unclear if force would be used to reverse such an act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

Venezuela might avoid the most severe international condemnation as it has emerged as one of [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Russia's staunchest international supporters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Given Moscow's attempted annexation of parts of Ukraine, the Russian government could [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | block any Security Council resolution condemning an invasion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Facing domestic difficulties and without the threat of military response, Maduro may believe he can weather immediate international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

If Venezuela launches an attack with relative impunity, it would be [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | another major blow to the accepted global order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. A successful Venezuelan invasion could [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | encourage other states to start questioning seemingly settled borders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This previously obscure dispute could [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | fundamentally reshape international relations in the 21st century]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

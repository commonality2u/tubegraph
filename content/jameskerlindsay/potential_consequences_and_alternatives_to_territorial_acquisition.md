In December 2024, President-elect Donald Trump caused an international stir by refusing to rule out using military force to seize Greenland, a Danish territory he views as vital to US security interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While some dismiss these comments as hype, others perceive a dangerous intent behind the threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This situation raises critical questions about the consequences of military action and potential alternative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Challenging International Norms

The modern international system is built on the principle that countries respect each other's [[sovereignty_territorial_integrity_and_political_independence | territorial integrity]], and state borders are considered sacrosanct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This principle has held remarkably well since 1945, with few wars of conquest across continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. However, this understanding is now being challenged as never before, exemplified by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and increasing threats from Donald Trump against territories like Canada, Panama, and now Greenland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Greenland: Geography, Population, and History

Greenland, the world's largest island at 2.2 million square kilometers (840,000 square miles), lies between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It has a population of around 56,000, with nearly 90% of native Inuit origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Most inhabitants live along the coastal regions as 80% of the country is covered in ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Greenland's history includes early North American settlers, the arrival of Inuit ancestors in the 11th century, and Norse settlers who disappeared by the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The Danes began arriving in the early 18th century, leading to Greenland becoming part of Denmark-Norway until 1814, when Denmark retained control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

During World War II, the United States oversaw the territory and established an important airbase following Denmark's fall to Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This base remained vital throughout the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Greenland's colonial status was abolished in 1953, becoming a Danish province, and it gained self-rule in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Since 2009, Greenlanders control most aspects of governance, including health, education, and natural resources, though Denmark manages foreign affairs, security, and defense, and provides a significant annual grant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

There have been growing calls for independence, but concerns exist about Greenland's viability as a country due to its small population and economic reliance on Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, geopolitical and environmental factors, such as melting Arctic ice creating new shipping routes and accessible resources, are changing this debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Trump's Interest and Growing Concerns

In December 2024, the president-elect asserted that the US considered ownership and control of Greenland essential for national security and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This is not a new idea; Trump previously proposed purchasing Greenland in 2019, but Denmark's Prime Minister dismissed the suggestion as "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Despite renewed rejections from Danish and Greenlandic officials, there are fears of a more dangerous intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. At a press conference in January 2025, Trump explicitly refused to rule out military action to seize Greenland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Observers suggest these comments have a more serious and calculated intent than previous remarks, driven by genuine security concerns over Greenland's status in a changing [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical context]], particularly regarding Russian and Chinese activities in the Arctic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## International Reactions and Potential Consequences

The strong international responses to Trump's latest comments indicate a belief in his seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Denmark has increased its defense commitment to Greenland, and key European partners like France and Germany have insisted that Greenland falls under the European Union's mutual defense provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Potential Acquisition Scenarios

There are several ways the US could potentially acquire Greenland, leaving aside questions about its necessity given Denmark is a NATO partner with an existing US base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>:

*   **Peaceful Acquisition (Purchase):** This is the most obvious route Trump has suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, Denmark cannot sell Greenland without its approval, which would likely require significant public spending promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Greenland's exact status would also need to be determined; full federal statehood is unlikely, suggesting a status akin to Puerto Rico or other US overseas territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Concerns remain whether initial funding would continue, leading many to view Denmark's current stewardship as preferable in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Military Action:** If peaceful efforts fail and Trump pursues an invasion, the [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict | diplomatic and political implications]] would be immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   **NATO Crisis:** An attack on Greenland would be a direct strike against a NATO ally, creating an unprecedented crisis within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   **EU Response:** While military response is unlikely, Denmark's EU partners would likely pursue strong diplomatic, political, and economic measures, such as imposing sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This could lead to US retaliation and a fundamental breakdown of Western relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
    *   **US Withdrawal from NATO:** Trump might use such an opportunity to withdraw the United States from NATO, a possibility he has repeatedly suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### The Dangerous Normalization of Force

Even if the worst-case scenario is avoided, Trump's statements are considered extremely dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. They normalize the idea that states can threaten to use force to seize territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If major powers like Russia and the United States openly discuss seizing land, it is likely others will follow suit, returning international relations to a "might-is-right" era marked by regular wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Alternative Solution: Free Association

An acceptable alternative for all parties could be the concept of "free association" in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This arrangement allows small independent states to develop a formal relationship with a larger country, which oversees their foreign and defense policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The United States already has such agreements with the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, all of which are separate UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

This could be an option for Greenland, perhaps even in conjunction with Denmark, creating a unique hybrid model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This would give Greenland the independence many desire, the security and support it needs, and provide the United States with direct control over important aspects of security and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The key question remains whether this would satisfy Trump's ambition, or if his goal is complete US control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

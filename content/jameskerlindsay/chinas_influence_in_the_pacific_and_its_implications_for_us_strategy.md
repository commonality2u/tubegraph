The United States is currently renegotiating key agreements with three small Pacific countries: the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These discussions are vital for securing U.S. national security interests and preserving international peace and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, but they have proven more difficult than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The outcome of these talks is significantly influenced by [[impact_on_international_relations | China's increasing economic, political, and strategic influence in the region]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## The Compacts of Free Association (COFA)

The three nations – the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau – are in "free association" with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This concept, originally developed for decolonisation, grants territories full internal self-government while an outside state manages aspects of their defense and foreign affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Under these agreements, known as the Compacts of Free Association (COFA):
*   The territories are self-governing states with the right to conduct their own foreign affairs, in consultation with Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Their citizens have the right to live and work in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   The United States assumes full authority and responsibility for their security and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This includes the crucial "right of strategic denial," allowing the U.S. to block other states from having military access to these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   The U.S. provides significant financial assistance and allows participation in certain federal economic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This aid can amount to up to a third of their annual budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The COFA agreements, with financial assistance periods extended in 2003 and 2004, are now up for renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## China's Growing Influence and its Implications

[[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | Beijing]] has been steadily increasing its support and extending its economic, political, and strategic influence across the Pacific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This growing presence presents a significant challenge for Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Threats to US Interests
*   **Reduced U.S. Influence**: If negotiations for the COFA fail, there are concerns that these states may be tempted to engage more actively with [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Realignment**: This could lead the Marshall Islands and Palau, two of the remaining 13 UN members that still recognize Taiwan, to switch their recognition to [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict | Beijing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Loss of Strategic Denial**: Most critically, a failure could eventually see the states terminate their compacts altogether, which would "rob Washington of its 'right of strategic denial'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This right is seen as a potential barrier against [[increasing_military_activity_in_the_south_china_sea | Beijing's wider military ambitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Regional Stability Concerns**: In May 2022, [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict | Beijing]] proposed a major new security relationship with 10 Pacific Island States, offering financial incentives and free trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This initiative was reportedly blocked by Micronesia, which called it "a threat to regional stability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## US Response and Strategy

The U.S. has recognized the critical value of these relationships, calling the Freely Associated States "the Bedrock of the U.S role in the Pacific" in its Indo-Pacific strategy documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Efforts to Counter Chinese Influence
*   **Prioritizing Negotiations**: Despite initial difficulties and delays caused by the pandemic, there is a growing sense of urgency to finalize the COFA renewals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Special Presidential Envoy**: In March 2022, the Biden Administration appointed a Special Presidential Envoy for the negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Congressional Support**: Congress has also called for the negotiations to be prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Increased Engagement**: Washington has stepped up its own efforts to win over the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. In September 2022, the U.S. hosted the first-ever Summit with Pacific island leaders, attended by President Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Blinken also participated in the latest round of compact negotiations held in Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Despite these efforts, a final agreement on the COFA renewals had not been reached by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The year 2023 is seen as vital for [[united_states_pacific_agreements_renegotiation | U.S. efforts to preserve its special links]] to these states and counter [[history_and_geopolitical_context_of_pacific_islands | growing Chinese strategic influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

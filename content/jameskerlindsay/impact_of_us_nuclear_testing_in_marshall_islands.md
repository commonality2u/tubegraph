The Marshall Islands gained significant international prominence during the late 1940s and 1950s as they became the central location for U.S. nuclear weapons testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. These tests were a major component of the United States' post-World War II defense strategy and had profound, lasting effects on the islands and their inhabitants.

## Background and Context
After World War II, the future of the [[history_and_geopolitical_context_of_pacific_islands | Pacific]] islands was managed by the newly established United Nations Trusteeship Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In April 1947, the UN Security Council designated the United States as the administering authority for what became the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This territory was divided into seven administrative districts and was initially run by the U.S. Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Nuclear Testing Program
The nuclear testing program in the Marshall Islands commenced in July 1946 with the first explosions on Bikini Atoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Over the subsequent 12 years, the United States conducted a total of 67 nuclear tests in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Catastrophic Impact
The extensive nuclear testing had a catastrophic environmental and health [[impact_on_international_relations | impact]] on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Decades later, the Marshall Islands continue to seek further compensation for these tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. However, Washington has firmly resisted additional payments, stating it has already provided half a billion dollars to the country for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

The legacy of the nuclear testing remains a significant factor in the relationship between the Marshall Islands and the United States, influencing ongoing discussions such as the [[united_states_pacific_agreements_renegotiation | renegotiation]] of the Compacts of Free Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

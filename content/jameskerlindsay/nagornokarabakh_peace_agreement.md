On 9 November 2020, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Armenia and Azerbaijan]] reached a peace agreement over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh after a brief but bloody conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While Azerbaijan hailed the deal as an end to the issue, it raised a number of important questions about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict

The [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | outbreak of fighting]] between [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh]] on 27 September 2020 raised the prospect of a serious and protracted [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | conflict]] in the South Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The war proved much shorter than many expected, with fighting ending after just six weeks following swift Azerbaijani advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The dispute primarily centers on Nagorno-Karabakh, a region predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians, which was historically part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. As the Soviet Union broke apart, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This declaration sparked a bitter war that left Armenian forces in control of Nagorno-Karabakh and several surrounding Azerbaijani districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Prior Efforts to Resolve the Conflict
In the years following the initial war, efforts were made to resolve the issue under a process led by [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia]], the United States, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Principles for resolution included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:
*   Return of districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Return of internally displaced persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   A land link between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   An agreement on Nagorno-Karabakh's future status to be confirmed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Implementation of security measures to underpin any deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Despite this apparent agreement on broad terms, a final deal was not reached, and a return to war became increasingly likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Azerbaijan dramatically increased its military spending, leading to fears of retaking territories by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Major confrontations occurred, including a four-day conflict in 2016 that resulted in several hundred deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, and another serious skirmish in July 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

On 27 September 2020, [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | full-scale fighting erupted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Azerbaijan used the opportunity to retake territory, swiftly moving to retake most areas to the south of Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. By early November, Armenian forces were clearly losing, and Azerbaijani forces entered Nagorno-Karabakh itself, taking the region's second-largest town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. At this point, Azerbaijan seemed on the verge of overrunning Armenian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## The Peace Agreement: Key Provisions

On the evening of 9 November 2020, [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia announced it had brokered an agreement]] between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to bring the fighting to an immediate end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The most significant aspect of the deal is that Azerbaijan regains control of all districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. By 1 December, Armenia would hand over any territory still under its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Azerbaijan also retains control of areas within Nagorno-Karabakh captured prior to the ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Armenia will withdraw all its armed forces from Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Key provisions include:
*   **Territorial Changes**: Azerbaijan regains control of all districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, including those captured in the war, and Armenia will hand over any remaining territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Azerbaijan keeps control of areas within Nagorno-Karabakh captured before the ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Transport Links**: Armenia retains a direct transport link with Nagorno-Karabakh, with Azerbaijan guaranteeing the safety of travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. A new road will be built across Armenian territory to connect the main part of Azerbaijan with its western exclave, Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, ending Azerbaijan's reliance on air links or a road through Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Return of Persons**: All internally displaced persons are permitted to return to their properties in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, a process overseen by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Prisoner Exchange/Casualties**: The sides agreed to an exchange of prisoners of war and other detainees, and the return of bodies of those killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Peacekeeping**: The agreement is guaranteed by [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Almost 2,000 Russian troops will be stationed along the ceasefire line for an initial five-year period, with automatic extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Russian troops and border guards will also control the corridors between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and between Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Outcomes and Implications

### For Azerbaijan
This agreement is a [[impact_of_the_peace_agreement_on_armenia_and_azerbaijan | huge victory for Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Having been defeated in the early 1990s, Azerbaijan feels it has restored its honor by taking territories around Nagorno-Karabakh and making significant encroachments within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. President Ilham Aliyev declared that the districts and Karabakh itself had been liberated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The securing of a land link to Nakhchivan further emphasizes the scale of the Azerbaijani win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Azerbaijan did not press on to retake all territory for three main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>:
*   The war's smooth progress was not guaranteed to continue, especially with winter setting in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   Key goals had been achieved: surrounding districts returned, and Nagorno-Karabakh no longer posed a credible separatist threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   Allowing Nagorno-Karabakh to continue existing provided a bargaining chip for the land corridor with Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### For Armenia
This is a [[impact_of_the_peace_agreement_on_armenia_and_azerbaijan | devastating defeat for Armenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that "this is not a victory, but there is no defeat until you consider yourself defeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, but Armenia was left with no choice but to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The leader of Nagorno-Karabakh explained that continued military action would have resulted in the loss of all of Nagorno-Karabakh and many more casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Many Armenians greeted the result with shock and anger, leading to protests and calls for the prime minister's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, the outcome is not a complete disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>:
*   The feared prospect of Azerbaijani troops completely overrunning Nagorno-Karabakh, with a real prospect of [[ethnic_cleansing_accusations_in_nagornokarabakh | ethnic cleansing]], has been averted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   Enough of Nagorno-Karabakh remains to be a viable entity for future talks between Yerevan and Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Regional Implications: Turkey and Russia
Beyond Armenia and Azerbaijan, two other major winners in this situation are Turkey and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

#### Turkey
Turkey was delighted with the outcome, calling it a "sacred success" for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. By openly siding with Baku, the Turkish president burnished his credentials at home and in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The creation of a land corridor across Armenia establishes a direct road link between Ankara and Baku, strengthening close economic, political, and ethnic ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

#### Russia
Russia is arguably the most important winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Initially, Moscow appeared uncertain on how to respond, despite a defense agreement with Armenia and obvious Turkish involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, Russia sought to avoid alienating Azerbaijan and maintain its position as a regional hegemon, choosing to play the role of "peacemaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Russia timed its intervention carefully to maximize its own advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>:
*   Any sooner would have damaged ties with Baku, which was winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   Any later, with Nagorno-Karabakh completely lost, would have robbed Russia of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Had Nagorno-Karabakh fallen, Armenians might have blamed Moscow for not intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

As it stands, Armenia will continue to rely on Moscow to retain what it still holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The presence of Russian peacekeepers in Azerbaijan also extends Russia's regional footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## The Future of Nagorno-Karabakh

In the immediate future, efforts will focus on ensuring the peace agreement's terms are met, including exchanges and the return of internally displaced persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

The fact that [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh continues to exist]], protected by Russian peacekeepers, means it remains an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. However, its hopes of consolidating independent statehood are over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The prospect of securing extensive autonomy within Azerbaijan appears unlikely for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

President Aliyev has stated that there will be no status of any sort for Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

> "They wanted independence. They were offered autonomy. Now they get nothing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>

While Baku may not make concessions immediately after its military victory, it may be willing to discuss options in the future as part of a final comprehensive settlement with Armenia, potentially including trade-offs related to the Nakhchivan corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This is likely to be a long-term prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Although Azerbaijan won the war, the dispute is not entirely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia's carefully timed intervention]] means the issue remains in limbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. While the Nagorno-Karabakh republic no longer exists as a de facto state, there are still loose ends to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The question remains whether Armenia and Azerbaijan can reach an historic overall political settlement, or if Russia and Turkey will keep the dispute "on ice" indefinitely to maintain regional leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Myanmar, also known by its original name Burma, is a country located in Southeast Asia, bordering the Indian Ocean to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It shares land borders with Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to its north and northeast, and Laos and Thailand to its east and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. It is the world's 39th largest country by area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Internal Diversity and Conflict

Myanmar has a population of approximately 55 million people and is highly diverse, home to an estimated over 100 ethnolinguistic and religious communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The largest group, the Bamar (or Burmans), are predominantly Buddhist and make up about half of the population, living mainly in the central parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Significant other ethnic groups include:
*   The largely Christian Karen and Buddhist Mon in the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   The Tai-speaking Shan and Chinese-speaking Wa in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   The predominantly Christian Chin, Buddhist Rakhine, and Muslim Rohingya in the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   The mainly Christian Kachin in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

This diversity has been a key factor in the country's protracted internal conflicts. The current [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | civil war]] is not simply a binary conflict between the military and pro-democracy forces; it also incorporates an 80-year [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | insurgency]] involving the state and various ethnic militias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This makes the [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | Burmese Civil War]] arguably the most complicated and protracted civil war in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Historical External Relations

Myanmar's modern geopolitical context began with Britain's imperial conquest during the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Originally incorporated into British India, it became a separate Crown Colony in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

During World War II, Japanese forces invaded in 1942, initially assisted by the anti-imperial Burma Independence Army (BIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, this alliance broke down, and the BIA later formed the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) under General Aung San to oppose imperial rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Britain agreed to grant independence after the war, which occurred on January 4, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## International Condemnation and Current Relationships

The military's actions, particularly its refusal to accept democratic election results in 1990 and the coup in 2021, have led to widespread international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Aung San Suu Kyi, a prominent democratic leader, was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize while under house arrest due to the military regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Additionally, the government, including Aung San Suu Kyi, faced international condemnation for its defense of the military's treatment of ethnic minorities, such as the Rohingya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

In recent developments, Operation 1027, a major offensive launched by the Three Brotherhood Alliance in October 2023, has made significant territorial gains against the military regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Crucially, neighboring China appears to have supported this alliance, partly because the groups are also fighting organized crime gangs along the Chinese border involved in internet scam industries that trafficked Chinese nationals into Myanmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Political talks to end the conflict have also been held under Indonesian auspices, indicating regional involvement in seeking a resolution to the ongoing instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This highlights the complex [[role_of_international_actors_in_myanmars_conflict | role of international actors]] in Myanmar's conflict.

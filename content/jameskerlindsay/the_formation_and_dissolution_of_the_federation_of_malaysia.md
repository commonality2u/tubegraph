Singapore, though one of the world's smallest countries, has become an economic powerhouse located at a vital crossroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its beginning was difficult, with its independence from Malaysia being a unique case of state creation in modern international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Singapore is often seen as the only state to have been created by being forced out of another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Singapore's Early History and Demographics

The island of Singapore is located just off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It spans approximately 721 square kilometers (280 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> and has a current population of 5.45 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The population is a diverse mixture of national groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
*   **Ethnic Chinese:** Approximately three-quarters of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Malays:** 15 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Ethnic Indians:** 7.5 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Others:** Remaining 1.5% (Europeans, Eurasians, and other communities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Singapore's modern story began in 1819 when British official Sir Stamford Raffles established a trading post on the then-sparsely inhabited island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Situated at a crucial junction between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, Singapore joined and later became the administrative center for other British settlements on the Malay Peninsula along the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Over the decades, Britain extended its influence over the peninsula, with various sultanates coming under its protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

The population of Singapore grew rapidly:
*   **1819:** A couple of hundred people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Within five years:** Over 10,000 inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **1901:** 225,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **1931:** Over half a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
This growth was driven by Malay and Indian immigration, but ethnic Chinese were the largest community almost from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## British Reorganization and the Federation of Malaya

During World War II, Japanese forces occupied the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Following the resumption of British rule, the territories were reorganized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   On April 1, 1946, Singapore ceased to be part of the Straits Settlements and became a British Crown Colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   The remaining Straits Settlements, along with the Federated and Unfederated Malay States, were amalgamated into the Federation of Malaya on February 1, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

This reorganization meant Singapore was administratively separate from the Malay Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Over the next decade and a half, Singapore achieved greater self-rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## The Push for Merger

As British decolonization progressed, questions arose about Singapore's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The neighboring Federation of Malaya gained independence on August 31, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Many in Singapore saw its place within the newly independent Federation, believing that as a small island, it couldn't survive on its own, despite little obvious economic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Leaders in the Federation were cautious about unification, fearing the implications of 3.6 million Chinese in Singapore outnumbering the 3.4 million Malays in a united country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, wider political concerns, including an ongoing communist insurgency in the region, persuaded them that Singapore might be overrun without protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Formation of Malaysia

In April 1961, Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, proposed the creation of a new state: Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This new state would comprise:
*   The Federation of Malaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Brunei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Sarawak and North Borneo (British colonies on the island of Borneo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Seven months later, in November 1961, the creation of the Federation of Malaysia was agreed upon in consultation with the British Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

On September 1, 1962, a controversial referendum was held in Singapore. Voters were offered three choices on the *form* of integration, but not on the merger itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. They chose considerable autonomy over a complete merger or a merger on equal terms with other new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Terms of Union
The details of the union were outlined in the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>:
*   Singapore would be represented in the federal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   It would contribute accordingly to the state budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   A common market would be established to ensure open trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

On August 31, 1963, British rule officially ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. On September 16, Singapore became one of the 14 states of the newly created Federation of Malaysia, alongside Sabah and Sarawak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Brunei, which was initially to have joined, opted to remain a British protectorate until its independence in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## A Difficult Union

From the outset, the union proved to be a difficult relationship, both economically and politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Significant differences between the two entities were magnified after Singapore's entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

*   **Economic Issues:** Singapore was unhappy at the failure to implement the promised common market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, while Malaysia felt Singapore was not meeting its financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Political Encroachment:** Malaysia's political leadership was angered when Singapore's ruling People's Action Party contested seats in Malaysia during the April 1964 general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The United Malays National Organisation, the dominant party in the rest of the Federation, viewed this as an encroachment on their political territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **[[ethnic_dynamics_in_singapore | Ethnic Tensions]]:** Against this backdrop, [[ethnic_dynamics_in_singapore | ethnic tensions]] between Malays and Chinese escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This culminated in rioting in Singapore in July and September 1964, resulting in 36 deaths and over 550 injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

By the end of 1964, relations between Singaporean politicians and people and the rest of Malaysia were under intolerable strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## The Decision to Separate

The Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, made it clear that if Singapore's politicians continued their path, the only route was for Singapore to leave the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. He later outlined an idea for a confederation, where Singapore would have full autonomy in all areas except defence and foreign policy, in return for giving up its seats in the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. However, discussions on this looser arrangement failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

By July 1965, Rahman had decided that the only remaining option was to force Singapore out of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, had also concluded that separation was the only viable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Top-secret talks were held on the terms of the "divorce," with even many government members in both Malaysia and Singapore kept unaware of the negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | Singapore's Expulsion]]

Weeks later, a deal was reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   On the morning of August 9, 1965, less than two years after joining Malaysia, a law for [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | Singapore's separation]] was unanimously passed by the Malaysian parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   The move surprised ordinary Malaysians and Singaporeans alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Tunku Abdul Rahman took personal responsibility for the decision, stating there was "no other choice" and it was "needed for peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   At the same time, a visibly upset Lee Kuan Yew broke down as he declared Singapore's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, calling for calm and promising a multi-ethnic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Six weeks later, on September 21, 1965, the Republic of Singapore became the 117th member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Temporary or Permanent?

What made the separation particularly interesting was that it was initially regarded as a temporary move based on political differences, not a permanent parting driven by fundamental incompatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The door was left open for eventual reunification, which many at the time saw as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

*   Rahman noted Singapore would be welcomed back at some point and later expressed regret at having let Singapore go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   Lee Kuan Yew also expressed regret and left the door open for a new settlement, stating it would be up to the next generation to bring about reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Of course, reunification never happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Almost 60 years later, there is no organized movement for reunification, though the idea is still occasionally floated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

While states typically resist the loss of territory, Malaysia's decision to expel Singapore was a unique case in modern international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Singapore's incorporation into Malaysia was never entirely comfortable, with fundamental political and economic differences quickly making the union difficult for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Ultimately, the situation was resolved peacefully and relatively easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. While Malaysia desired to be rid of Singapore, Singapore was ready to accept the decision and go its own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Thus, contrary to the common perception of a dramatic expulsion, [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | Singapore's independence]] could equally be regarded as a consensual mutual secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

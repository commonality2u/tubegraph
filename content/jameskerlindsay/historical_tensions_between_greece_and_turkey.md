The relationship between Greece and Turkey is often characterized by a cyclical pattern of confrontation and rapprochement, deeply shaped by their shared history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Over the past century, their ties have fluctuated between periods of good working relations and extreme tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Historical Background

The story of the complex relationship between Greece and Turkey begins with the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The predominantly Greek-speaking and Orthodox Christian eastern half, known as the Byzantine Empire, continued after the fall of the Western Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. However, with the emergence of Islam in the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire began to lose territory, accelerating after the Seljuk Turks became a dominant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

In 1071, the Byzantine and Seljuk armies fought at Manzikert, paving the way for the eventual conquest of Anatolia by Turkic tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The Ottoman Turks, emerging in the late 13th century, rapidly conquered much of the remaining Byzantine Empire, finally overrunning Constantinople in 1453 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Greeks lived under Ottoman Turkish rule for the next three and a half centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Emergence of Modern Greece

By the early 19th century, Greek national consciousness grew, leading to a revolt against Ottoman control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. An independent Greek Kingdom emerged in 1830, centered on the Peloponnese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The new state sought to unite all Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean and gradually expanded, incorporating Central Greece, the Ionian Islands, Crete, and Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. However, key territories like Constantinople, Cyprus, and Asia Minor remained outside its reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Post-World War I and the Treaty of Lausanne

After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, Greece invaded Asia Minor, seeking to claim Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Although initially making significant gains, the Greek army was defeated by Turkish nationalist forces in October 1922 and forced to retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

On July 24, 1924, Greece and the new Republic of Turkey signed the Treaty of Lausanne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This treaty established their modern borders and required the demilitarization of certain islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. It also mandated a population exchange, relocating almost all Orthodox Christians in Turkey and Muslims in Greece, with exceptions for communities in Istanbul and Thrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Periods of Rapprochement and Alliance

Relations quickly improved under Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos and Turkish President Mustafa Kamal Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. They signed bilateral agreements, a Treaty of Friendship, Neutrality, Conciliation, and Arbitration in 1930, and a Cordial Friendship Pact in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In 1934, they even formed a joint defense alliance with Romania and Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Despite a strain during World War II, when Turkey remained neutral while Greece was occupied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, [[turkey_greece_relations | relations]] soon recovered. In 1952, both countries joined NATO, the central pillar of Western defense during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### The Cyprus Dispute and Aegean Tensions

The period of good [[turkey_greece_relations | relations]] ended in the mid-1950s with the emergence of the Cyprus issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Though Greece had gained the Dodecanese from Italy in 1947, Cyprus remained unclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Formerly ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Lausanne, Greek Cypriots sought to unite with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. An armed campaign launched in April 1955 to force Britain out led to tensions with Turkey, as Turkish Cypriots called for the island's partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

In August 1960, Cyprus became an independent republic based on a power-sharing agreement guaranteed by Britain, Greece, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. However, constitutional arrangements broke down in December 1963, leading to renewed fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

The breaking point came in July 1974 when the Greek military junta overthrew the Cypriot president to secure unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Citing its right to protect the constitutional order, Turkey invaded on July 20, seizing control of a third of the island. This division remains a fundamental point of contention between Greece and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Simultaneously, tensions arose over the Aegean, especially after the discovery of oil in the early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Disputes included:
*   **Continental Shelf**: Turkey argued the seabed was an extension of the Anatolian Peninsula, while Greece claimed it belonged to the Greek islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The International Court of Justice ruled it had no jurisdiction without Turkey's agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Territorial Waters and Airspace**: The Treaty of Lausanne allowed Greece three nautical miles, extended to six miles in 1936 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The 1983 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea permitted an extension to 12 miles, but Turkey's parliament passed a resolution making any Greek extension a justification for war, arguing it would make the Aegean a "Greek lake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Other Issues**: Rows also broke out over air traffic control in the Aegean, the militarization of certain islands, and minority rights in Thrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

A significant crisis erupted in March 1987 when Turkey began oil exploration in the Aegean, narrowly averting armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Though leaders met in Davos in 1988 to improve [[turkey_greece_relations | relations]], talks went nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

New problems continued to emerge:
*   **"Grey Zones"**: In 1996, a Turkish ship ran aground on an uninhabited islet, leading to a dispute over its sovereignty, which Greece considered clear but Ankara disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **PKK Leader Arrest**: In 1999, the arrest of the PKK leader, Abdullah Öcalan, as he left the Greek Embassy in Kenya, was seen by Ankara as a fundamental betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Renewed Rapprochement and Recent Tensions

Despite coming close to conflict in 1999, [[turkey_greece_relations | relations]] changed dramatically a few months later when both countries were hit by major earthquakes, sparking a new period of rapprochement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Greece lifted its long-standing veto on Turkey's European Union membership candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

[[turkey_greece_relations | Bilateral relations]] improved, with many agreements signed, increased intergovernmental cooperation, and exploratory talks on the continental shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Cultural links, tourism, and trade flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The emergence of [[the_history_and_development_of_turkeys_political_landscape | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] as Turkish leader in late 2002 further improved ties, as he prioritized relations with Greece and solving Cyprus, emphasizing Turkey's EU membership commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

However, the upbeat mood began to fade by the end of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Outstanding issues remained unresolved, and [[the_history_and_development_of_turkeys_political_landscape | Erdogan]] became more authoritarian and estranged from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. As Turkey-EU negotiations stalled, [[turkey_greece_relations | relations with Greece]] deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

This deterioration became internationally apparent in 2015 when Turkey allowed over a million migrants to cross the Aegean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. [[erdogans_visit_to_greece | Erdogan's visit to Greece]] in 2017, the first Turkish presidential visit in 65 years, was a disaster when he called for the Treaty of Lausanne to be modernized, which the Greek president immediately rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Another attempt to resolve Cyprus failed that summer, leading Ankara to call for a two-state solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

Further undermining [[turkey_greece_relations | relations]], Turkey became increasingly vocal about territorial claims in the wider Mediterranean, fueled by growing energy finds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Ankara signed a maritime agreement with Libya covering an area claimed by Greece and launched oil exploration near Greek islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. In 2022, Turkish military aircraft incursions over the Aegean islands sharply increased, indicating broader tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Recent Developments

Despite the ongoing challenges, 2023 saw a shift as Greece and Turkey marked the centenary of the Treaty of Lausanne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. A devastating earthquake in Turkey once again drove rapprochement, with Greece sending emergency rescue teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Having won reelection and facing economic problems at home, [[the_history_and_development_of_turkeys_political_landscape | Erdogan]] seemed to decide to mend [[turkey_greece_relations | relations]] with Western partners, including Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Against this backdrop, [[erdogans_visit_to_greece | Erdogan's visit to Greece]] on December 7, 2023, was hailed as a new start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He called for the Aegean to become a "sea of peace" and stated that no problem was unsolvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis signed 15 bilateral agreements covering energy to agriculture, and agreed on a non-binding 10-point declaration of friendly relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This included commitments to political dialogue, confidence-building measures, a joint action plan, and resolving disputes amicably through direct consultations or other UN Charter means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

However, there is a sense of déjà vu, as Greece and Turkey have been in this position many times before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Without settling outstanding bilateral issues, including Cyprus, any new attempt at a fresh start is likely to only last until the next crisis, representing the latest in a long cycle of ups and downs between the two Mediterranean neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

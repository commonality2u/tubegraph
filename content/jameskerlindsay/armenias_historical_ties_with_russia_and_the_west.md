Since the end of the Cold War, Armenia has maintained close ties to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. However, these ties have recently come under unprecedented strain, leading Armenia to reconsider its overall strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. The war in Ukraine has prompted many European countries to re-evaluate their foreign policy, with some, like Sweden and Finland, pursuing NATO membership, and others, like Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, focusing on speedy European Union integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. For Armenia, the geopolitical shift has been much more muted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Historical Background

Armenia, a landlocked country in the South Caucasus, has a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Emerging before the Sixth Century BC, its strategic location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia led to encounters with major ancient powers such as the Hellenistic Empire of Alexander the Great and the Persians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. While they established their own kingdom stretching from the Mediterranean to the Caspian Seas, they were later caught between the imperial rivalry of the Romans and the Parthians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

In 301 AD, Armenians became the first nation to adopt Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. During the Middle Ages, they experienced rule under Arab Islamic forces until 885 when a new independent Armenian kingdom was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This kingdom was absorbed by the Byzantine Empire in the mid-11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Subsequently, Armenia faced pressure from the Seljuk Turks and the Mongols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. By the 16th century, Western Armenia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, and Eastern Armenia came under Persian Imperial rule, a division that lasted for several hundred years despite frequent conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Rise of Russian Influence and Soviet Era

The 19th century saw the emergence of Russia as a new imperial power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Russia seized control of Eastern Armenia from Persia in 1828 and began moving against the Ottoman Empire, prompting several major Armenian rebellions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

During the First World War, in 1915, the Ottoman leadership ordered the forced expulsion of up to 1.5 million Armenians from its eastern provinces, an event widely recognized as an act of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. As the Ottoman Empire collapsed, Armenia briefly declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. However, in September 1920, communist Russian forces invaded, establishing the Soviet Republic of Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Two years later, it was united with Azerbaijan and Georgia to form the Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which dissolved in 1936, leading to Armenia emerging as a separate top-level Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Alignment with Russia

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia became an independent sovereign state, joining the United Nations on March 2, 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Despite its newfound independence, Armenia retained close links to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. It joined the Commonwealth of Independent States and maintained close economic relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Armenia also continued to host a Russian military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

The relationship with Moscow was crucially shaped by the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the breakaway region of [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Although Russia officially remained neutral in its international efforts to find a solution, many perceived it as favoring Armenia, partly by providing it with arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Armenia's control of Azerbaijani territory led to tensions with NATO-member [[turkeys_foreign_relations_with_russia_and_the_west | Turkey]], which has close ties to Azerbaijan and imposed an embargo on Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. This geopolitical squeeze underscored Armenia's need to maintain close links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

In 2002, Armenia became part of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a military alliance comprising six former Soviet states, including Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic Shifts and Western Engagement

With Russia's ties to the West deteriorating rapidly, and a pro-Russian leadership toppled in Georgia in 2003, fears grew that other states, including Armenia, might push for NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Armenia began signaling a desire for closer ties to the European Union, joining the EU's Eastern Partnership in May 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

However, this shift abruptly ended in 2013 when Armenia, despite nearly completing negotiations for a free trade agreement with the EU, announced its decision to join the new Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. While Armenia later signed a new Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU in 2017, it seemed firmly committed to its relationship with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Strained Relations with Russia and Growing Western Engagement

A significant change occurred in 2018 with the ousting of the long-standing government in Yerevan and the rise of reformist Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Although Pashinyan initially sought to maintain close ties with Russia, suspicions grew on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Moscow mistrusted the democratic government in Yerevan, while Armenia became concerned about thawing relations between Russia and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

In 2020, Azerbaijan launched a military campaign to retake [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Russia brokered a ceasefire and deployed a peacekeeping force, but Azerbaijan's victory was a massive blow for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This led to widespread resentment against Russia, with many Armenians blaming Moscow for failing to prevent or stop the war earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

As [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | relations between Yerevan and Moscow steadily deteriorated]], Russia openly criticized Pashinyan, and Armenia began engaging more openly with U.S. and European leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Armenia also started providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, much to Moscow's anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

The depth of the strained relations was highlighted in September 2023 when Azerbaijan launched a fresh attack against [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]], and Russia made no effort to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Following Azerbaijan's complete control of the region, its inhabitants fled to Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

Since then, relations have seemingly collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. Armenia ratified its participation in the International Criminal Court, a move condemned by Moscow given ongoing investigations into alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. In November 2023, the Armenian prime minister skipped the latest CSTO summit, widely seen as a direct snub to Vladimir Putin, especially as it followed a high-profile trip by Pashinyan to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

### Current Dilemma: Balancing Russia and the West

While Armenia may be prepared to abandon the CSTO, a switch to NATO would be extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. Deep-rooted tensions between Armenia and [[turkeys_foreign_relations_with_russia_and_the_west | Turkey]] mean Ankara, and potentially Hungary, would likely block any application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Even if not vetoed, [[turkeys_foreign_relations_with_russia_and_the_west | Turkey]] might demand unacceptable conditions, such as Armenia dropping genocide accusations or granting Azerbaijan a land corridor to Nakhichevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

EU membership is considered a more logical and feasible option, especially given Georgia's recent recommendation for candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. However, this does not seem to be on Armenia's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Many Armenians do not see EU membership as a realistic possibility, partly due to a perception that the EU would not want Armenia despite a pro-Armenian lobby in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Concerns also exist about the societal implications of joining the EU, particularly regarding liberalization and greater LGBT rights, which are seen as challenging for a largely conservative country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. These attitudes about EU membership are seemingly encouraged by Russia's active disinformation campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. Public opinion polling shows about half the population favors EU membership, significantly lower than in most other potential members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Armenians perceive that the West cannot provide the security they need against Turkey and Azerbaijan, especially given fears that Azerbaijan may try to seize southern Armenia to create a land bridge to Nakhichevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. They believe that only Russia could prevent such an attack, especially as any move to divide Armenia would remove an essential link to neighboring Iran, a key Russian ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. Reflecting their long history of being caught between rival powers, most Armenians feel they must accept the current situation: they no longer trust Russia but believe abandoning it completely for closer Western ties is not a viable option, at least for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

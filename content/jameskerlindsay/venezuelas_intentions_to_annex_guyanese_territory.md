As 2023 concluded, concerns grew that Venezuela was preparing to invade neighboring Guyana, following decades of tensions over a disputed border [00:00:02]. Despite an ongoing case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Caracas appeared intent on seizing the disputed territory by force [00:00:12]. This [[venezuelan_guyanese_border_dispute | Venezuelan Guyanese border dispute]] is one of the most significant current postcolonial border disputes [00:01:25].

## Historical Context

The world map is marked by borders established by European colonialism, which carved out vast territories and exploited natural resources over centuries in Africa, Asia, and the Americas [00:00:45]. When decolonization accelerated in the mid-20th century, it was largely agreed that these colonial boundaries would become the borders of newly independent states, a principle broadly respected to avoid endless territorial conflicts [00:01:02].

### Colonial Origins of the Dispute

Venezuela, originally part of the Vice-Royalty of New Granada, became a separate captaincy-general in 1777 and achieved independent sovereign statehood in 1830 after joining and then breaking away from the new Republic of Colombia [00:03:08]. Meanwhile, other European powers, including the Netherlands, established a colonial presence in South America [00:03:33]. During the Napoleonic Wars, three Dutch colonies—Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo—were seized by France and then Britain [00:03:58]. In 1814, the Dutch recognized British sovereignty over these territories, which were merged in 1831 to create British Guiana [00:04:08].

Tensions emerged early between Venezuela and British Guiana [00:04:18]. Venezuela argued that the area had once been Spanish and that borders were undecided [00:04:22]. Britain, however, commissioned a survey claiming most territory up to the Orinoco River [00:04:29]. In 1841, Venezuela protested, counter-claiming sovereignty over all land west of the Essequibo River, an area covering two-thirds of British Guiana [00:04:34]. The dispute escalated, leading to Venezuela breaking off diplomatic relations with Britain in 1887 [00:04:47].

The United States intervened, calling on London to accept judicial resolution [00:04:55]. Britain eventually agreed, and the issue was referred to arbitration in 1897 [00:05:03]. On October 3, 1899, the court issued its decision, awarding a portion of the territory to Venezuela but most of the area between the rivers to Britain [00:05:16]. Despite its disappointment, Venezuela accepted the outcome, and a formal border was marked out in 1905 [00:05:30]. For the next six decades, the issue appeared resolved [00:05:41].

## The Dispute's Resurrection and Escalation

The situation dramatically changed in 1962 as the United Kingdom prepared to grant independence to British Guiana [00:05:46]. Venezuela suddenly resurrected the matter, arguing that the 1899 decision was reached behind its back and was "null and void" [00:06:00]. Although Britain and Venezuela examined the ruling's circumstances, they could not settle the matter [00:06:09]. They agreed that a new commission would be created after Guyana's independence to search for a practical settlement [00:06:15]. Crucially, if this failed, the UN Secretary-General would have the authority to determine a settlement mechanism under Article 33 of the UN Charter, governing peaceful dispute settlement [00:06:24].

On May 26, 1966, Guyana became independent and joined the UN [00:06:39]. However, the commission's mandate ended in 1970 without an agreement [00:06:47], and further high-level talks in the 1980s also failed [00:06:53]. In 1990, the UN offered its Good Offices (a form of mediation) to break the deadlock [00:06:58]. Despite many attempts over the following decades, the sides remained far apart [00:07:06].

### Discovery of Oil and ICJ Involvement

After 25 years of talks, the situation radically changed in 2015 following the discovery of oil in Essequibo [00:07:14]. In 2016, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced a final one-year intensive mediation effort, but this also failed [00:07:22]. As a result, in 2018, the new UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, decided that efforts for a peaceful, negotiated solution were exhausted [00:07:35]. After five decades of discussions, he announced that the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN's judicial organ, should determine the matter [00:07:46].

On March 29, 2018, Guyana referred the matter to the ICJ [00:07:55]. Venezuela initially refused to participate, arguing the Court lacked jurisdiction [00:08:01]. However, in 2020, the judges decided they had the authority to hear the case [00:08:08]. Following public hearings in November 2022, the Court issued its first ruling six months later, rejecting Venezuela's claim that Britain should be involved [00:08:14]. A final ruling is not expected until mid-2024 [00:08:31].

### Recent Venezuelan Actions

As the sides await the ICJ's final ruling, the situation on the ground has changed [00:08:37]. Guyana now boasts the world's highest per capita oil deposits and has experienced rapid economic development, becoming one of Latin America's wealthiest countries [00:08:42]. This contrasts sharply with Venezuela, where the populist policies of President Nicolás Maduro have led to an economic collapse [00:08:53]. This [[impact_of_oil_wealth_on_venezuelas_economy | impact of oil wealth on Venezuela's economy]] and its neighbor's economy has influenced the dispute.

Caracas has become increasingly vocal about the border issue, a process that accelerated in the second half of 2023 [00:09:04]. Venezuela increased its military presence along the frontier, constructing a new military airstrip [00:09:15]. On October 23, Venezuela announced plans for a consultative referendum addressing five questions, including whether to abandon the ICJ case and authorize unilateral measures to resolve the situation [00:09:23]. Many immediately interpreted this as a direct threat to invade and annex the territory [00:09:39].

Guyana appealed to the ICJ for provisional measures to deter Venezuela [00:09:46]. On December 1, the Court unanimously called on Venezuela to refrain from modifying the situation in areas under Guyana's control and urged both sides to avoid actions that could aggravate the issue [00:09:54]. Despite the ruling, Venezuela proceeded with the vote [00:10:14]. Although turnout was reported low, the measures passed by a vast majority [00:10:18]. Maduro called the result a "total success" [00:10:25].

Within days, Venezuela announced it had annexed the territory and distributed new maps showing 'Guayana Esequiba' as part of the country [00:10:35]. It ordered foreign offshore energy companies to cease operations within 90 days and its own oil producers to prepare for work in the area [00:10:46]. Ominously, troops were moved closer to the frontier [00:10:56].

## International Response and Implications

Initially, Guyana did not believe an invasion was imminent, but the tone has rapidly changed [00:11:01]. President Mohamed Irfaan Ali called Venezuela's actions an "existential threat" and initiated intensive diplomatic contacts with regional partners and international actors, including the United States, which expressed full support for Guyana [00:11:08]. Guyana has also referred the issue to the UN Security Council [00:11:28]. The UN Secretary-General has called for calm and reiterated support for peaceful settlement [00:11:34].

### Concerns about Invasion and International Order

While Venezuela is cementing its claim, the question remains whether it will invade [00:11:45]. What began as a populist stunt in Venezuela has become more serious [00:11:58]. Neighboring Brazil has moved forces closer to the border, indicating its nervousness [00:12:08].

Any military attack would fundamentally violate international law, as the territory is internationally accepted as belonging to Guyana, and an ICJ case is ongoing [00:12:18]. An invasion would provoke international outcry [00:12:32]. While many countries, including the United States and the European Union, would likely impose economic and political sanctions, it is unclear if force would be used to reverse the act [00:12:37].

Venezuela might avoid the most severe international condemnation [00:12:51]. As one of Russia's staunchest international supporters, and given Russia's attempted annexation of parts of Ukraine, the Russian government could block any UN Security Council resolution condemning an invasion, although a General Assembly vote might still be possible [00:12:58].

Facing domestic difficulties and without the threat of a military response, Maduro may believe he can weather immediate international condemnation and take a longer-term view [00:13:15]. This is similar to Russia's belief that the international community may eventually accept its annexation of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, if not officially, then tacitly [00:13:26]. The Guyanese vice president has acknowledged that Venezuelan leadership may be thinking similarly [00:13:37].

If Venezuela launches an attack and does so with relative impunity, it would be another major blow to the accepted global order [00:13:47]. If successful, a Venezuelan invasion could encourage other states to question seemingly settled borders [00:14:00]. For these reasons, this previously obscure [[venezuelan_guyanese_border_dispute | border dispute]] could fundamentally reshape international relations in the 21st century [00:14:07]. This also raises questions about [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | potential geopolitical consequences of a Venezuelan invasion]] and [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela's changing international status]].

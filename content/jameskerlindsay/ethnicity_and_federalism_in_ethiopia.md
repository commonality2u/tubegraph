On November 4, 2020, the Ethiopian government initiated a military offensive in Tigray, its northernmost province, following months of escalating tensions with the local government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This development sparked concerns that Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country, might be heading towards civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The crisis is deeply rooted in the nation's complex [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | ethnic tensions and federalism]].

## [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Historical Context of Ethiopian Politics]] and Conflicts

Ethiopia has a long and rich history, being one of the oldest countries in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Once known as Abyssinia, it maintained its independence despite European colonization in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. It was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

However, Ethiopia is no stranger to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. From 1974 to 1991, the country endured a brutal civil war that led to a famine claiming over 1.5 million lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. In recent years, there was hope for a new era of prosperity, with the country's GDP growing by nine percent in 2018-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to settle the border with [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]], which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Despite these developments, the country has never been entirely at peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Conflicts have included:
*   A two-year war with [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] from 1998 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   A nearly 25-year conflict with [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | ethnic Somali separatists]] of the Ogaden National Liberation Front in the east, which ended with a peace agreement in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   A half-century separatist conflict in Oromia province, which continued despite a supposed peace deal in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In November 2020, the Oromo Liberation Army attacked a village, resulting in over 54 [[historical_role_of_amhara_in_ethiopian_statehood | ethnic Amhara]] deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Numerous other instances of unrest across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Ethnic Diversity and Demographics

Ethiopia is East Africa's second most populous country, with 115 million people, after [[ethnic_tensions_in_nigeria | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It is home to over 80 distinct languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The largest ethnic groups include:
*   **Oromo**: Approximately 35% of the population, located in the central, southern, and western parts of the country, in a district known as Oromia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Amhara**: Around 27% of Ethiopians, centered in the northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Somalis**: About 6% of the population, located in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Tigrayans**: Also about 6% of the population, located in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## The Shift to Federalism and Tigrayan Dominance (1991-2018)

The roots of the current tensions trace back to the civil war of the 1970s and 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The war began after Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a Marxist military coup in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This sparked opposition from numerous movements, most notably the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which allied with other anti-government forces, including the main [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrean]] independence movement, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

By May 1991, TPLF-led rebel forces seized the capital, Addis Ababa, overthrowing the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This led to significant changes:
*   [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Ethiopia was reorganized along federal lines, officially becoming the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Its new constitution explicitly permitted secession, even outlining a process for constituent parts to become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Although nominally democratic, Ethiopia became a one-party state under the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), an alliance of four political groupings that included the TPLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Despite representing only six percent of the population, Tigrayans, through the TPLF, held dominant roles in the federal government, with Meles Zenawi serving as prime minister from 1995 to 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Escalating Tensions and the Tigray Crisis (2018-Present)

The power dynamic shifted significantly in 2018 when Abiy Ahmed Ali, an [[historical_role_of_amhara_in_ethiopian_statehood | ethnic Oromo]], assumed the leadership of the EPRDF following major protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This led to increased tensions as Tigrayans became increasingly marginalized from the government and military they had once dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Concerns also grew that the new prime minister's calls for national unity aimed to undermine the country's federal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

In 2019, the EPRDF was dissolved and replaced by the Prosperity Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Crucially, the TPLF refused to join this new party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The immediate trigger for the current confrontation was a dispute over the timing of national and regional elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Elections, originally set for August 2020, were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government extended the mandate of lawmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   The TPLF-controlled government in Tigray rejected this, arguing it was evidence of increasing authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. They proceeded to hold regional elections in September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Relations rapidly deteriorated as neither the federal government nor the Tigray regional administration recognized the other's legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   In early October, Tigray withdrew its representatives from federal government institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   Days later, the Ethiopian upper house of parliament voted to withhold budget subsidies to Tigray, leading to threats from Tigray to withhold tax receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   An attempt by the federal government to reshuffle military leadership in Tigray was blocked by the Tigray administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   The most serious incident occurred in early November when a federal military barracks in Tigray was attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali accused the TPLF of orchestrating the attack to steal equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

In an address to the nation, the Prime Minister stated:
> "While the federal government has used all means to thwart a military engagement against the TPLF, a war however cannot be prevented only on the goodwill and decision of one side but on the mutual choice for peace by both parties. The last red line has been crossed with this morning's attacks and the federal government is therefore forced into military confrontation. The Ethiopian National Defence Forces, under the direction of a command post, have been ordered to carry out their mission to save the country and the region from spiralling into instability." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>

Hours later, the Ethiopian government declared a six-month state of emergency in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Impact and Concerns

The government's shutdown of electricity, telephone, and internet connections into Tigray has made it difficult to ascertain the exact situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. However, regional and international observers are highly concerned that this could lead to a full-scale civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The situation is particularly worrying because Tigray is home to a large proportion of Ethiopia's troops and weaponry, and the TPLF maintains its own forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This makes a direct confrontation between Ethiopia and Tigray distinctly different from other armed insurgencies faced by the Ethiopian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

> [!warning] Potential Consequences
> An escalation of fighting could have dramatic effects across Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, potentially involving neighboring states like [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. There are significant humanitarian concerns, with serious fighting potentially leading to large refugee outflows into neighboring regions and contributing to wider regional instability across the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

The Tigray Crisis marks a very serious development for Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The escalating tensions between the federal government and the TPLF, formerly the dominant force in [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopian political history and conflicts]], have the potential to spiral out of control and develop into a full-scale civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This poses a significant threat to peace and security in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The eastern region of the [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), particularly North and South Kivu, has experienced persistent unrest following the Second Congo War [00:07:04]. This instability has led to the emergence of numerous insurgent groups, many of which fight for control over the region's rich natural resources [00:07:16]. Among these, two significant factions with ties to [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] have played a prominent role: the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwanda]] (FDLR) and M23 [00:07:24].

## Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)

The FDLR was formed by Hutu militants, some of whom had participated in the 1994 genocide in [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] [00:07:29]. The presence and activities of the FDLR in eastern Congo have been a long-standing concern for the Rwandan government [00:11:58]. Even after the defeat of Joseph Kabila in 2018 and the rise of FÃ©lix Tshisekedi to power, the FDLR continued its attacks in the east [00:08:29]. [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] states that its primary interest in the region is to defeat these Hutu rebel groups, which it claims are terrorizing Tutsis in Congo and pose a threat to [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]]'s own peace and stability [00:11:41].

## M23

M23 emerged as a group composed of Tutsi mutineers from the Congolese army [00:07:41]. [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]]'s President Paul Kagame openly supported M23, viewing it as an opportunity to counter the Hutu FDLR's challenge to his regime [00:07:47]. However, M23 faced accusations of widespread atrocities [00:07:58].

In December 2013, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]]'s Western allies successfully persuaded Kagame to agree to a peace deal that would integrate M23 members into the Congolese Armed Forces [00:08:03]. Despite this agreement, problems persisted [00:08:15].

M23 resumed its activities in November 2021, claiming that the Congolese government had failed to reintegrate its members [00:08:35]. This resumption led to a series of attacks that resulted in hundreds of deaths and displaced over 200,000 people [00:08:46]. Within months, M23 seized significant areas of territory across eastern Congo [00:08:51].

Although the East African Community (EAC), a seven-member political group including [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] and Congo, managed to secure a ceasefire, fighting soon resumed [00:08:57]. The UN has openly accused [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] of supporting M23, despite Kagame's denials [00:09:07].

### Recent Developments and Allegations

The [[Current tensions between the DRC and Rwanda | latest fighting]] escalated on January 27, 2025, when M23 fighters entered Goma, the capital of North Kivu province [00:09:20]. Heavy clashes occurred, leading to the deaths of 13 South African peacekeepers [00:09:26]. As thousands fled Goma, reports indicated that M23 rebels were advancing towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu [00:09:33].

A particularly worrying development has been the allegations that a large number of well-armed and well-trained [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwandan troops]] have openly joined the fight alongside M23 rebels [00:10:06]. This has prompted Congolese President Tshisekedi to announce a massive military mobilization, stating that the two countries would be at war unless [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] withdraws its forces [00:10:15]. South Africa, a close ally of Congo, has also cautioned [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] against further actions against its forces [00:10:26].

Despite growing international pressure, including threats of sanctions and aid halts, Kagame remains defiant [00:11:01]. While seemingly confirming the presence of [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwandan forces]] in the DRC, he maintains that his country is simply responding to an ongoing security threat and views accusations against [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] as victim-blaming [00:11:09].

### Underlying Motives and [[Potential humanitarian crisis in Central Africa | Humanitarian Concerns]]

Any pretense that [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] is not directly involved in the [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] has been shattered [00:11:32]. While [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]] asserts its primary interest is in defeating Hutu rebel groups (FDLR) that threaten Tutsis in Congo and, by extension, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]]'s stability [00:11:41], many suspect additional motives.

Critics argue that [[Rwanda and Congo conflict | Rwanda]]'s support for M23 and the current invasion is a pretext for territorial gain [00:12:04]. Some even draw parallels to Russia's invasion and occupation of eastern Ukraine, suggesting that Kagame's goal may be to oust President Tshisekedi [00:12:10]. The precise motives behind the [[rwandas_role_in_congos_conflicts | Rwandan invasion]] are a subject of intense debate [00:12:33].

Regardless of the underlying reasons for the fighting, there is a serious and immediate [[Potential humanitarian crisis in Central Africa | humanitarian dimension]] to consider [00:12:41]. As the [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] in the east escalates, there are significant fears that Congo and the broader Central Africa region could be plunged into another devastating war, potentially leading to tens of thousands killed and millions displaced [00:12:44].

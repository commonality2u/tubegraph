Since the normalisation of relations, trade and economic ties between the United States and Vietnam have developed rapidly, marking a significant turnaround from their historically difficult past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Vietnam's Economic Context
The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a lower middle-income country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, with a GDP per capita of approximately $3,750 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Its population stands at just under 100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Early Post-War Embargo and Reconstruction
The [[impact_of_vietnam_war_on_vietnam_and_the_us | Vietnam War]] left much of Vietnam destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. In the aftermath, Vietnam linked any normalisation of ties with the United States to significant development aid and assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

Washington, having lost the war and facing issues like missing personnel, imposed an embargo on Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. This embargo hindered Vietnam's reconstruction efforts and led to its reliance on the Soviet Union, especially after its relations with communist China collapsed in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

## Path to Normalization and Economic Engagement
Changes began in the mid-1980s when Vietnam started to open its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Simultaneously, it agreed to assist with the issue of US personnel missing in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. In response, Washington permitted non-governmental aid organisations to engage with Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

This process accelerated following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which deprived Vietnam of a crucial ally and, alongside ongoing tensions with Beijing, forced Vietnam to rethink its orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. In 1994, the United States lifted its embargo on Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, and the two countries normalised relations the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

## Growing Economic Ties
After the turn of the millennium, economic ties between the US and Vietnam developed rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. This growth was underpinned by agreements signed in 2001 and 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

In addition to trade, the two countries established educational and cultural programs, and launched initiatives to address environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

### Current Trade Landscape and Challenges
Despite flourishing ties, some critical points of difference remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, particularly concerning the massive imbalance in trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Recent figures indicate bilateral trade is around US$150 billion a year, but 80 percent of this comprises Vietnamese exports to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. This raises questions about market access for US products in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

Furthermore, concerns about democracy and human rights also underpin the relationship, with reports highlighting issues relating to freedoms of expression, movement, arbitrary arrest, judicial independence, and cruel and unusual punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

## Security as a Driving Factor
A key factor now driving the relationship is mutual concern over [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China's growing regional and international significance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. While China remains Vietnam's largest trading partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>, [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | tensions have continued]], specifically due to a steadily escalating dispute over the [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | South China Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. This has been a key factor shaping the relationship between Vietnam and the United States over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>, driving not only economic and political ties but also increased defence and security cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

Despite these growing ties with the US, Vietnam has no wish for a full-scale conflict with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>, maintaining a delicate balance of cooperation and rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Nevertheless, Vietnam appears to be moving ever closer to the United States as tensions continue to escalate in the South China Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

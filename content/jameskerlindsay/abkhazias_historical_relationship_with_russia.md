Abkhazia, a territory that broke away from Georgia, has a complex and deeply intertwined history with Russia, marked by periods of control, protection, and growing influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This relationship has been a crucial factor in Abkhazia's survival and its current status as a de facto state, reliant on a patron for political, diplomatic, economic, and security needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Historical Ties and Early Russian Control

While Abkhazia was historically part of medieval Georgia, it often maintained a distinct identity as a separate kingdom, principality, or vassal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>. Its relationship with Russia began to solidify in the first half of the 19th century when it came under Russian imperial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09">[03:09]</a>. In 1864, its status as a principality was abolished, and it was integrated directly into the Russian Empire as a military province, a status it held until the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>.

## Soviet Era Influence

Following the Russian Revolution, Abkhazia was initially incorporated into the Georgian state that emerged in 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>. However, after the Red Army conquered Georgia, Abkhazia became a separate Soviet Socialist Republic within the newly formed USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>. This near-equal status was terminated a decade later in 1931 by Joseph Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, who reincorporated Abkhazia into Georgia as the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>. This period saw severe repression, including the deportation of tens of thousands of Abkhazians to other parts of the Soviet Union, replaced by Russians, Georgians, and Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[03:58]</a>. While oppression eased after Stalin's death in the 1950s, Abkhazia remained an autonomous republic within Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09">[04:09]</a>. As the Soviet Union weakened in the 1980s, Abkhazia sought to become a separate republic within the USSR, although it did not attempt to break away from the Soviet Union like [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | South Ossetia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Conflict and Russian Patronage

After Georgia gained independence in 1991, Abkhazia initially accepted continued autonomy within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>. However, in 1992, believing that Georgia's vote to restore its pre-Soviet constitution would end their autonomy, Abkhaz deputies unilaterally declared independence, sparking a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a>. During this conflict, Abkhaz militias were strengthened by Russian paramilitaries and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14">[05:14]</a>.

Following the 1994 ceasefire agreement, Russian troops, operating under the Commonwealth of Independent States Peacekeeping Force, patrolled the buffer zone between Georgia and Abkhazia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>. Russia also led UN-sponsored peace talks for over a decade, which made little progress as Abkhazia insisted on its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06">[06:06]</a>.

The situation escalated dramatically in August 2008 with the [[georgias_history_with_russia_and_territorial_conflicts | Russo-Georgian War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08">[07:08]</a>. Following renewed fighting in [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | South Ossetia]] and skirmishes around Abkhazia, Russia launched a full-scale invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14">[07:14]</a>. Within two weeks, Russia decisively defeated Georgian forces and subsequently recognized both Abkhazia and [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | South Ossetia]] as independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25">[07:25]</a>.

## Increasing Russian Presence Post-2008

Moscow's recognition of Abkhazia's independence provided a greater sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>. Since then, Russia has steadily increased its presence, becoming an increasingly significant internal actor in Abkhazia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18">[08:18]</a>.

### Economic and Political Dominance
Russia exerts considerable influence over Abkhazia's political developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24">[08:24]</a>. Its economic dominance has also grown, with Russian aid and subsidies funding infrastructure projects and covering large parts of the Abkhaz state budget, including pensions and public sector salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33">[08:33]</a>. Russian trade, investment, and tourism have become central mainstays of the Abkhaz economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42">[08:42]</a>.

### Security and Military Integration
Moscow has also steadily increased its security and military presence, stationing troops, building bases, and taking a more direct role in Abkhazia's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49">[08:49]</a>. For example, Russia took responsibility for manning Abkhazia's frontier with Georgia in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>. In 2014, concurrent with the annexation of Crimea, Russia and Abkhazia signed a strategic partnership, establishing a joint military force and agreeing to harmonize Abkhazia's foreign and defense policies with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09">[09:09]</a>. This deal also promised over $270 million in subsidies to Abkhazia over the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24">[09:24]</a>.

## Recent Tensions and Growing Resentment

Despite the promised aid, Russian subsidies have fallen substantially over the past decade, from $300 million in 2012 to $140 million in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54">[09:54]</a>. Simultaneously, fears have grown regarding Russian involvement in Abkhazia's private sector, with Russian companies and individuals increasingly buying local businesses and private properties, driving up prices and making ownership difficult for young Abkhazians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24">[10:24]</a>.

These factors culminated in November 2024 when proposed legislation aimed at extending Russian ownership of local companies and land sparked widespread protests, with demonstrators storming the Abkhaz parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>. Although the bill was withdrawn, the protests led to the resignation of Abkhaz president Aslan Bzhania, who reportedly fled to a Russian military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10">[11:10]</a>.

While these events indicate growing [[abkhazias_current_political_unrest | resentment against Russian domination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37">[11:37]</a>, observers caution against interpreting them as a full-scale revolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41">[12:41]</a>. Abkhazia remains internationally isolated and relies on Moscow for prosperity and protection, meaning it cannot simply reject Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12">[12:12]</a>. Protesters were even noted to carry Russian flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32">[12:32]</a>. The Russian government also kept its distance during the protests, not intervening to support the outgoing leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46">[12:46]</a>.

For now, most Abkhazians still view Russia as their preferred partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08">[13:08]</a>. However, the [[impact_of_russian_economic_and_military_presence_in_abkhazia | events underscore]] the problematic reality that while de facto states declare independence, they can become wholly dependent on their patron state, controlling their ability to pursue other paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50">[13:50]</a>.

Eritrea is described as one of the world's longest-standing and most brutal dictatorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, ruled by [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]] for over three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His rule has transformed Eritrea into one of the most secretive and authoritarian countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, often called "Africa's North Korea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]]'s Tight Grip
Since 1993, when Eritrea gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, hopes for a modern democracy quickly broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Following a border dispute and war with [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopia]] (1998-2000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Afwerki]] tightened his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Eritrea now operates as a totalitarian one-man dictatorship under the ruling People's Front for Democracy and Justice (formerly the EPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Key aspects of [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Afwerki]]'s repressive rule include:
*   **Suppression of Dissent** His regime has crushed dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Any opposition is suppressed, often leading to imprisonment, torture, or even execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Political Control** Independent media has been shut down, and elections have been indefinitely postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. A large-scale crackdown in 2001 resulted in almost all opposition leaders being jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Lack of Constitutional Governance** The 1997 draft constitution, which enshrined democracy and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, has been refused endorsement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Eritrea lacks a legislature, independent judiciary, or press freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Human Rights Violations
Under [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Afwerki]]'s rule, fundamental human rights have been wholly curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Indefinite Military Service** The regime enforces a conscription system forcing men and women into military service without a clearly defined end term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Forced Labor and Detention** Dissidents and escapees detail harrowing accounts of forced labor, arbitrary detention, and torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Exodus of Citizens** These harsh domestic conditions have led hundreds of thousands of Eritreans to flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## International Condemnation and Involvement
[[Eritreas international relations and foreign policy | Eritrea's foreign policy]] has also faced considerable international criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Tigray Civil War** In 2018, Eritrea reached a peace agreement with [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopian]] Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, Eritrea then sent troops to fight alongside [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopian]] forces in the [[Ethiopian Civil War in Tigray | Tigray civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, leading to allegations of large-scale war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Regional Instability** Eritrea has also been accused of arming insurgents in neighboring Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## [[Opposition movements against Eritreas dictatorship | Opposition Movements]]
Despite the severe repression, [[Opposition movements against Eritreas dictatorship | opposition to Afwerki's rule is growing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Exiled Activists** Exiled activists, including journalists and former government officials, work to expose Eritrea's human rights abuses, often at considerable personal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The Eritrean government targets critics abroad with intimidation, surveillance, and threats against their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Diaspora Engagement** An increasing number of escapees and dissidents speak out against [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Afwerki]]'s brutal rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Younger second-generation Eritreans living abroad are becoming more active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Bolder Opposition Groups** [[Opposition movements against Eritreas dictatorship | Opposition groups]] have become bolder, using Eritrean independence days for demonstrations against the regime in Western capitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Organizations like Brigade Nhamedu (Blue Revolution) are reaching out to diaspora communities to spread awareness about human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **[[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopia]]'s Role** As tensions rise again between [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopia]] and Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopia]] appears more involved in supporting [[Opposition movements against Eritreas dictatorship | opposition efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Opposition groups, including Blue Revolution, openly met in Addis Ababa in early 2025 to discuss overthrowing the [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Afwerki]] regime, an act that implies tacit [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopian]] acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Despite these challenges, [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Afwerki]]'s grip on power appears tight internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, and there is little evidence to suggest the regime is under serious internal threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The question of regime change, potentially through [[Ethiopian Eritrean relations and history | Ethiopian]]-sponsored insurgency or invasion, remains unlikely due to Eritrea's fortifications and the inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

However, [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Afwerki]]'s advanced age (almost 80) and lack of a groomed successor raise questions about the regime's longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Observers speculate that his death could lead to internal power struggles or civil unrest, though the military or ruling elite might attempt to maintain the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. While external movements are gaining momentum, removing [[Eritreas authoritarian rule under Isaias Afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]] from power remains a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

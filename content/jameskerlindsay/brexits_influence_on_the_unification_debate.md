In May 2022, elections in Northern Ireland saw Sinn Féin, a party advocating for Irish unification, become the largest political force in the province, a century after the island's partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This development has fueled speculation about a potential united Ireland, a goal that previously seemed almost impossible but has seen dramatic changes over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Brexit's Impact on the Unification Debate

A significant factor contributing to the increased prospects for Irish unification is Britain's decision to leave the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. This decision was considered the "biggest blow" to the Belfast Agreement (Good Friday Agreement), which had established a framework for peace and governance in Northern Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### The Northern Ireland Protocol
To prevent the reintroduction of a hard border between the United Kingdom and Ireland, which remains an EU member, a special agreement was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This arrangement allowed Northern Ireland to effectively remain within parts of the EU's single market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

While this agreement eased concerns for Nationalists, it angered many Unionists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. They perceive the new requirement for customs checks on goods coming from Great Britain as weakening Northern Ireland's ties with the rest of the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. It is against this backdrop that Sinn Féin emerged as the largest single party in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### Shifting Public Opinion
Brexit has contributed to a growing belief that Northern Ireland's place within the UK is less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Approximately 20 percent of people believe this to be the case, a sentiment that could potentially influence the outcome of a future vote on unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Support for unification could also intensify as the [[economic_impact_of_brexit | economic consequences of Brexit]] become more pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

A notable consequence of Brexit is the surge in applications for Irish passports, even among Protestant Unionists, who are entitled to Irish citizenship due to British citizens losing their freedom of movement within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### Mainland British Indifference
Furthermore, Northern Ireland appears to have lost its historical resonance in mainland Britain, where most people are now largely indifferent to its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. Polling conducted during the peak of the Brexit debate revealed that ardent Brexit supporters, when presented with a choice between Brexit and Northern Ireland, overwhelmingly favored "ditching Ulster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

While these factors suggest an increased likelihood of unification, it is important to note that a majority in Northern Ireland has not yet expressed a desire for unity in opinion polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

On 4 November 2020, while global attention was on the US presidential elections, the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopian government]] announced a military offensive in Tigray, its northernmost province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This followed months of tension with the local government, raising concerns that Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous nation, could be sliding into [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Background to Conflict

Ethiopia has a history of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. From 1974 to 1991, it experienced a brutal civil war that contributed to a famine, resulting in over 1.5 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Despite hopes for a new era of prosperity, evidenced by a 9% GDP growth in 2018-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for resolving a border dispute with Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, the country has never been entirely at peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Previous conflicts include:
*   A two-year war with Eritrea from 1998 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   A nearly 25-year conflict with ethnic Somali separatists of the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which ended with a [[peace_agreement_between_ethiopia_and_tigray | peace agreement]] in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   An ongoing half-century separatist conflict in Oromia province, despite a purported peace deal in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In early November, the Oromo Liberation Army attacked a village, killing over 54 ethnic Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Numerous other cases of unrest across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The fighting in Tigray is particularly concerning due to its potential to escalate into a full-scale [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Ethiopian Demographics and Governance

Ethiopia is located in East Africa, landlocked and bordered by Somalia, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It is the 27th largest UN member state by area (1.1 million square kilometres) and has a population of 115 million, making it Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The country is ethnically diverse, with over 80 distinct languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Key ethnic groups include:
*   **Oromo**: Approximately 35% of the population, centered in Oromia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Amhara**: Around 27% of Ethiopians, located in the northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Somalis** and **Tigrayans**: Each represent about 6% of the population, located in the east and north respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Ethiopia, historically known as Abyssinia, maintained independence during the European scramble for Africa and was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Roots of the Current Crisis

The current tensions are rooted in the civil war of the 1970s and 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The story began with the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by a Marxist military faction on 12 September 1974, leading to a civil war against various opposition movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Rise of the TPLF and Federal Reorganization
The most significant opposition movement was the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which allied with other anti-government forces, including the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. By May 1991, TPLF-led rebel forces seized the capital, Addis Ababa, overthrowing the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

This led to several key changes:
*   Eritrea gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Ethiopia was reorganized along federal lines, officially becoming the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Its new constitution explicitly permitted secession, even outlining a process for constituent parts to become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Although nominally democratic, Ethiopia became a one-party state under the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), an alliance that included the TPLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Despite Tigrayans representing only 6% of the population, they held dominant roles in the federal government, with Meles Zenawi serving as Prime Minister from 1995 to 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Shift in Power and Growing Tensions
This dominance changed in 2018 when Abiy Ahmed Ali, an ethnic Oromo, assumed leadership of the EPRDF following major protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Tigrayans became increasingly marginalized from the government and military they had long dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Concerns also grew that Abiy's calls for national unity aimed to undermine the country's federal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Additionally, Abiy, despite being a reformer, began exhibiting authoritarian tendencies, including harsh measures on freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

The breakdown in relations became evident in 2019 when the EPRDF was dissolved and replaced by the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF crucially refused to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Escalation to Military Confrontation

The immediate catalyst for the current confrontation was a dispute over national and regional elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Originally scheduled for August 2020, elections were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading the government to extend lawmakers' mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   The TPLF-controlled government in Tigray rejected this, viewing it as evidence of increasing authoritarianism, and proceeded to hold regional elections in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   Following this, relations rapidly deteriorated as neither the federal government nor the Tigray regional administration recognized the other as legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Escalating disputes included:
*   Tigray withdrawing its representatives from federal government institutions in early October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   The Ethiopian upper house of parliament voting to withhold budget subsidies to Tigray, prompting threats from Tigray to withhold tax receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   The Tigray administration blocking a federal government attempt to reshuffle military leadership in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The most serious incident occurred in early November when a federal military barracks in Tigray was attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali accused the TPLF of orchestrating the attack to steal equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He declared that "The last red line has been crossed with this morning's attacks and the federal government is therefore forced into military confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The Ethiopian National Defence Forces were ordered to carry out their mission to stabilize the country and region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Hours later, the Ethiopian government declared a six-month state of emergency in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Concerns and [[international_and_regional_implications_of_the_tigray_conflict | Implications]]

The exact situation in Tigray remains unclear as the government has shut down electricity, telephone, and internet connections to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Regional and international observers are concerned that this could spark a full-scale [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray | civil war]] that might even lead to the country's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

A key factor making the situation particularly worrying is that Tigray is home to a significant proportion of Ethiopia's troops and weaponry, and the TPLF maintains its own forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This means a direct confrontation between the federal government and Tigray is distinct from other insurgencies Ethiopia has faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

In the event of escalation, the conflict could have extremely serious consequences:
*   **Domestic Impact**: Dramatic effects in other parts of Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Regional Instability**: Neighboring states like Eritrea may become involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **[[potential_humanitarian_crisis_in_central_africa | Humanitarian Concerns]]**: Significant refugee outflows into neighboring regions could occur, feeding wider regional instability across the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

There have been widespread international calls for both sides to show restraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The [[ethiopia_and_tigray_conflict_overview | Tigray Crisis]] marks a far more serious development for Ethiopia than previous conflicts, with the potential to spiral out of control into a full-scale civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The escalating tensions between Ethiopia and Tigray pose a significant threat to peace and security in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

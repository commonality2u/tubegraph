Concerns have recently emerged regarding [[georgias_geopolitical_alignment_and_relations_with_moscow | Georgia's geopolitical alignment and relations with Moscow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite parts of the country being under Russian occupation and the government openly supporting European Union membership, accusations of a drift towards Russia have intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This situation is seen as a fascinating case study in a geopolitical era where established patterns of international relations are being challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Historical Context with Imperial Russia

While a distinct Georgian identity is believed to have emerged over 2,000 years ago, Georgia became a unified kingdom during the Middle Ages, expanding its cultural, political, and military influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This golden age concluded with Mongol invasions in the 13th century, after which the kingdom fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Over subsequent centuries, Georgians faced pressure from the Ottoman and Safavid empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

In 1783, one of the Georgian kingdoms sought protection from Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This proved to be a fateful decision; within 30 years, the kingdom was annexed, and by the mid-19th century, the Georgian people as a whole were under Russian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Soviet Era and Independence

As Tsarist Russia collapsed in 1917, Georgians joined Armenians and Azerbaijanis to form the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This union was short-lived, and on May 26, 1918, Georgia declared its independence, creating the Democratic Republic of Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, this independence lasted only three years, as the Red Army invaded in February 1921, incorporating Georgia into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Georgia remained within the USSR for the next 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

At the start of the 1990s, after nationalist protests were suppressed in 1989, Georgia declared independence on April 9, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It formally gained statehood with the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. On July 31, 1992, Georgia was admitted to the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Initially, Georgia joined the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a loose grouping of former Soviet republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Emergence of Territorial Conflicts

From its independence, Georgia faced significant challenges, including a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Additionally, two regions, [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] and [[abkhazias_historical_relationship_with_russia | Abkhazia]], attempted to break away, leading to violent clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These conflicts concluded with Kremlin-brokered ceasefires policed by Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These events severely strained relations between Moscow and Tbilisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### The 2008 War

In 2003, the Rose Revolution peacefully overthrew President Eduard Shevardnadze, due to unresolved issues with breakaway territories, economic problems, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Mikheil Saakashvili, a Western-educated lawyer, became president, promising reforms and a move closer to the European Union and NATO, which sharply deteriorated relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

War erupted in August 2008, resulting in a decisive Russian victory within days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Soon after, in retaliation for the West's recognition of Kosovo's independence from [[historical_ties_between_serbia_and_russia | Serbia]], Russia recognized [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] and [[abkhazias_historical_relationship_with_russia | Abkhazia]] as independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This conflict marked a decisive break in relations, with Tbilisi cutting diplomatic ties to Moscow and withdrawing from the CIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Post-2008 Relations and Occupied Territories

[[abkhazias_historical_relationship_with_russia | Abkhazia]] and [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]], which comprise around 20% of Georgia's territory, unilaterally declared independence but have only been recognized by Russia and a few other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These areas remain under [[impact_of_russian_economic_and_military_presence_in_abkhazia | Russian military control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

After Mikheil Saakashvili's government, which faced accusations of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses, was defeated in 2012, the Georgian Dream coalition came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. While maintaining a pro-Western orientation, including signing an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014 and opening a joint training center with NATO, the new administration adopted a more conciliatory approach towards Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Efforts began to normalize relations by focusing on trade, travel, and humanitarian cooperation, avoiding issues related to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Despite condemning Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, Georgia refused to impose sanctions against Russia, arguing for a pragmatic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Trajectory

The current Georgian government faces accusations of pro-Russian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Mass demonstrations erupted in June 2019 following a Russian lawmaker's visit to the Georgian Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Concerns also grew about democratic backsliding, including issues with judicial independence and media freedom, alongside increasing [[impact_of_foreign_influence_and_domestic_legislation_on_georgias_foreign_policy | Russian disinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

With Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Georgian government balanced its position: it condemned the attack and voted in favor of UN resolutions against Moscow but still refused to impose sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Georgia applied to join the European Union in 2022, but unlike Moldova and Ukraine, it was given 12 priorities for reforms, including democratic reforms, improving the rule of law, and countering foreign disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

A controversial law requiring organizations receiving over 20% of income from external sources to register as "agents of foreign influence" (mirroring Russian legislation) was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Although initially dropped due to internal opposition and international criticism, it was reintroduced and passed on May 28, 2024, overriding a presidential veto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This law has fueled the view that the government is under Moscow's influence, despite denials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

The government's rhetoric has taken a pro-Russian turn, with the Georgian Dream leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili, promoting conspiracy theories about a "Global War Party" being behind conflicts in Ukraine and the 2008 Georgia-Russia war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This shift is seen as an attempt to strengthen the government's position before parliamentary elections by hindering opposition and shoring up its base, potentially through measures like new anti-LGBT legislation which resonates with older, socially conservative voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

This strategy runs counter to the demands of Georgia's Western partners and the high public support for EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The government's pushback against the EU for its internal survival provides Moscow with an opportunity to exert influence, as Russia does not condition its support on the rule of law or democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Moscow's aim may not be a complete Georgian realignment, but rather to divide society and reduce Western influence and support for Euro-Atlantic integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This increasingly seems to align with the practical, if not stated, needs of the Georgian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

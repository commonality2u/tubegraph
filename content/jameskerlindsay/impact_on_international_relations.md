Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been widely condemned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. From a legal and political perspective, this war goes far beyond anything previously seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, representing an unprecedented challenge to the entire system of modern [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Russia has faced significant criticism on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, including widespread sanctions and a UN General Assembly resolution deploring Moscow's aggression, supported by 141 out of 193 member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While comparisons are drawn to other major invasions of modern times, such as the US-led invasions of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), and the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia (1999) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, Russia's actions represent something substantively different since the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It could be the most fundamental challenge to the established international order since the end of the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Core Principles of International Politics

To understand the significance of Russia's actions, it's important to consider the conflict in terms of three interlinked, yet separate, concepts that underpin international politics: sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While other invasions have violated one or two of these principles, Russia's actions in Ukraine represent an unprecedented challenge to all three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Sovereignty

Sovereignty is the universally understood right of countries to determine what happens within their borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Emerging in the mid-17th century, it underpins the modern understanding of statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other states remains the foundation of the modern international order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> and is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

By definition, all invasions by one state or a group of states against another constitute a violation of a country's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This applies to cases such as Iraq, Libya, Serbia, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Cyprus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Terms like "peace interventions" or "special operations" are merely sanitized descriptions of invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Territorial Integrity

Territorial integrity is a fundamental principle of the international system, also enshrined in the UN Charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. It signifies that states have a responsibility to respect one another's defined physical boundaries, whether land borders or maritime limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. In modern times, the principle of territorial integrity has largely been respected, with wars of territorial conquest being rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Neither the US invasion of Iraq nor Afghanistan resulted in any border changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, preserving their territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Thus, while these interventions violated sovereignty, they did not challenge territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The NATO campaign against Yugoslavia eventually led to Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, violating Serbia's territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, though the end goal was never annexation by any protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

In contrast, Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity is clear-cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, despite having recognized Ukraine's borders upon its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Furthermore, Russia recognized the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk days before the current war, preparing for further annexations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. If Russia succeeds, these areas are expected to be incorporated into the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Political Independence

Political independence is also explicitly stated in the UN Charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. It can signify the existence of a state as a sovereign entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Invasions aimed at the formal extinction of a state are rare in modern times, as international law no longer accepts conquest as a legitimate basis for state extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The best example of an attempt to eliminate a sovereign state was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Major Western interventions did not lead to state extinction; Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yugoslavia (now Serbia) continue to exist as UN member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Russia, however, has suggested that the very existence of an independent Ukrainian state is at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. President Putin has stated that Ukrainians and Russians are "one people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> and openly declared that Ukraine's future as an independent state is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Political independence can also mean the extent to which a state controls decisions made within its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Many invasions aim for regime change, which challenges a state's political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. US and partners' efforts to remove the Taliban from Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein from Iraq amounted to a violation of both countries' political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. In contrast, regime change was not NATO's goal in Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In Ukraine, regime change is on the agenda, with Putin justifying the war as a need to 'demilitarize and de-Nazify' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Even without full annexation, Moscow might install a puppet regime or integrate Ukraine into a confederal arrangement with Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Unprecedented Nature of Russia's Actions

What sets Russia's current actions apart from other major modern conflicts is that they violate all three fundamental principles of modern [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   All invasions violate sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   US-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan challenged independence but did not violate territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   NATO action against Serbia violated its territorial integrity but did not challenge its political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   Russia, however, has violated Ukraine's sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and is set on abolishing its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

These are the fundamental rules of the international system, governing how countries understand the limits of their behavior towards one another for over 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. By acting as it is, Russia is violating every principle that underpins this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The fact that Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and uses threats of nuclear retaliation makes its actions even more disturbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It indicates that Russia has "absolutely no respect whatsoever for the basic principles and norms of [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, effectively "ripping up the rule book entirely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

While any invasion is a human tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, this war is more significant than it may seem, with the potential to profoundly affect the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. How countries understand the system's rules affects their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The erosion of these rules has been partly facilitated by Western states, who, despite strong arguments for their interventions (e.g., creating democratic states, stopping human rights abuses), have contributed to this erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Other countries will inevitably justify their violations on similar grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Russia's actions in Ukraine go far beyond anything seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The invasion has the potential to mark a fundamental break with the global political system built over the past 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This system, despite its flaws, has been an improvement on the "might makes right" approach to international affairs of the past, which may now be returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. While other interventions deserve condemnation, Russia's actions in Ukraine certainly deserve to be opposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

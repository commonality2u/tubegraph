The relationship between the Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups significantly impacts [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Ethiopian politics]], particularly concerning the country's unity and stability. Tensions between these two dominant groups, alongside the federal government and other ethnic communities, have escalated into conflicts that threaten Ethiopia's very existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:34:24]</a>.

## Historical Context and Amhara Dominance

For centuries, the Amhara played a central role in Ethiopia. From the late 13th-century creation of the Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia), Amhara dominated the state, holding crucial positions of power and extending their influence across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The Amharic language and Orthodox Christianity became central to Ethiopian national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

However, this dominance began to decline:
*   **1974 Military Coup**: The overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by the left-wing military regime known as the Derg reduced traditional Amhara influence, despite many officers being Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **1991 Overthrow of Derg**: A coalition of ethnic militias, led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), overthrew the Derg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. In an effort to address minority grievances, the new TPLF government reorganized Ethiopia along ethnic lines in 1995, dividing it into nine regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Territorial Transfers**: Crucially, several areas traditionally controlled by the Amhara were incorporated into the Tigray region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This, combined with Tigrayan dominance in the new federal system, fueled Amhara resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Many Amhara abandoned traditional Ethiopian national identity, turning instead to Amhara nationalism to better represent their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Shifting Alliances and Growing Tensions

Amhara resentment persisted for two decades under Tigrayan dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
In 2018, [[current_political_situation_involving_ethiopian_prime_minister_abiy_ahmed | Abiy Ahmed]] Ali, an ethnic Oromo, became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Initially, this change seemed positive for the Amhara, as Abiy Ahmed worked to reduce the TPLF's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

### The Tigray War and Amhara Betrayal

In 2020, a dispute between the federal government and the TPLF over national elections escalated into a brutal two-year civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Amhara forces joined the fight alongside the federal government, viewing it as an opportunity to reclaim territories lost to Tigray in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. They seized control of western Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

However, hopes for territorial return were short-lived. The November 2022 peace agreement, mediated by the African Union, called for the withdrawal of non-Tigrayan forces, including Amhara militias, from Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. This perceived betrayal by the federal government led to greater discontent among the Amhara, who felt their contributions and historical grievances were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

### Deterioration of Amhara-Oromo Relations

As relations worsened between Amhara forces and the federal government, problems also deepened between the Amhara and neighboring Oromo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Political Suspicions**: Suspicions grew that [[current_political_situation_involving_ethiopian_prime_minister_abiy_ahmed | Abiy Ahmed]] was favoring his own ethnic group, and distrust emerged between the Amhara and Oromo wings of the ruling Prosperity Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Religious Tensions**: There was widespread anger when Oromo priests attempted to break away from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which uses Amharic as its working language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Border Conflicts**: Growing confrontations occurred along the Amhara-Oromo boundary as regional forces fought for control of several areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. These matters worsened after the Tigray war, as both sides gained combat experience and weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Clashes also increased between Amhara forces and separatist groups in the Oromia Special Zone, an autonomous area within Amhara established in the 1995 territorial reorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

## Current Conflict in Amhara

Against this backdrop of growing Amhara-Oromo fighting, the Ethiopian government launched a military operation on April 9, 2023, to disarm local militias in Amhara and bring them under national military control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. This action was met with widespread protests and resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

The **Fano** group, which emerged as a nationalist movement in 2018 during rising Amhara-Oromo tensions and played a leading role in the Amhara campaign in western Tigray, became central to the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Though a loose affiliation rather than a single organized group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, Fano enjoys considerable popular support and rapidly recruited fighters from disaffected Amhara security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. By mid-2023, Fano had captured major towns, leading the government to declare a state of emergency on August 4, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

Despite the Ethiopian National Defense Forces regaining control of many towns, opposition continued, leading to brutal tactics including artillery bombardment and airstrikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Efforts to find a political solution have failed due to the lack of a defined Fano leadership and an unfulfilled promise of a referendum on territorial issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. The violence continues to grow, with aid organizations noting ongoing fighting and the rise of armed criminal gangs exploiting lawlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. This situation contributes to a sense that the conflict in Amhara is spiraling out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Ethiopia's Future

The [[ethiopian_government_and_amhara_militia_conflict | Amhara militia]] conflict raises troubling questions about Ethiopia's future. As the second-largest group in the country, a full-scale conflict in Amhara would have devastating human and political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Ethiopia's ability to survive is questioned if the Amhara, who symbolize Ethiopian identity more than any other group, are marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

The complex ethnic tensions extend beyond Amhara to include Tigrayans, Oromo, and the large [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Somali community]] in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. Ethiopia faces a precarious balancing act in maintaining national unity while addressing the competing grievances of its various ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

The ethnic federalism introduced in the 1990s, intended to promote autonomy and address historical grievances, has inadvertently fueled rivalries and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. While Ethiopia has shown resilience in previous crises, including the Tigray conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>, there is a possibility that the current conflict could be the one that breaks Ethiopia apart, especially given the fundamental role the Amhara have played in the country's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Dealing with the conflict in Amhara is therefore more critical than many outsiders may appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

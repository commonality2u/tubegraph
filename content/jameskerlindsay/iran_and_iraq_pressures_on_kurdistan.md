In September 2023, the leader of the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Kurdish Regional Government]] reportedly sent a letter to US President Biden, warning that the region is on the verge of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This marks a disastrous turnaround for [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Iraqi Kurdistan]], which was long seen as a key US ally and a potential future country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Background of Iraqi Kurdistan

The Kurds are often described as the world's largest nation without a state, with estimates of up to 35 million Kurds living across Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia, along with a diaspora of 5 to 10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. While offered the possibility of their own country after World War I, the plan was never implemented, and the area intended for an independent Kurdish state was divided between the new Republic of Turkey and the Kingdom of Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Despite this, the [[historical_quest_for_kurdish_independence | Kurdish quest for a Homeland]] has continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

In contrast to the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey, which waged a violent insurgency for independence before shifting to demand greater autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, the Kurds in Iraq followed a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. After Saddam Hussein's annexation of Kuwait and the First Gulf War, Kurds in the north revolted against the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The United Nations subsequently created no-fly zones in northern Iraq to protect the Kurds, providing the security needed to establish an autonomous territory known as the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Kurdish Region of Iraq]] (KRI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Over the following years, the KRI effectively became a *de facto* state, possessing many features of a country, including a defined territory, a settled population, democratic government institutions, and a network of informal diplomatic ties with other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. It was gradually seen as a "country in waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## The 2017 Independence Referendum

After the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the preference was for the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Kurdish region]] to remain part of a new federal Iraq, despite sympathy for Kurdish aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Nevertheless, an informal regional referendum in 2005 showed almost complete support for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

In July 2014, the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRG]] president announced plans for a vote, which was shelved due to Islamic State attacks but resumed after ISIS was forced from the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. In June 2017, the regional government announced the [[2017_kurdish_independence_referendum | referendum]] would be held that September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The announcement led to an immediate outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
*   The Iraqi central government, Turkey, Iran, and Syria vehemently opposed any Kurdish attempts to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Close allies like the United States and Britain expressed concerns, insisting the focus should remain on defeating ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Israel was the only significant international actor to support the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Despite these objections, the vote proceeded, with 93% of 3 million participants favoring independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, hopes for statehood were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

After the vote, a concerted effort began to dissuade the region from breaking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>:
*   The Iraqi government isolated the region, suspending international flights to and from the KRI, taking control of border crossings with Iran, and seizing disputed territory captured from ISIS, including the oil-rich region of Kirkuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Neighboring states, Iran and Turkey, indicated they would impose sanctions and punitive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   Key allies, including the United States, announced they did not recognize the results of the votes and would not recognize an Iraqi Kurdish State created by unilateral declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Faced with overwhelming opposition, the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRG]] had no choice but to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Within weeks, the referendum results were frozen, and two months later, the Iraqi Supreme Court ruled that secession was illegal and annulled the referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Current Pressures on Iraqi Kurdistan

The region's current worries of collapse stem from increasing pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>:

### Pressure from the Central Iraqi Government
The [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRG]] has faced growing pressure from the Iraqi central government, particularly over energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. After taking control of Kirkuk, Baghdad won a critical case at the International Court of Arbitration in March 2023, alleging that Kurdish oil exports via Turkey were illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This victory halted a lucrative trade of 450,000 barrels of oil per day, causing oil revenues to collapse and leaving the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRG]] struggling to pay its officials and administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Pressure from Iran
Iran has faced a growing Kurdish separatist threat of its own and argues that militant groups are taking refuge in [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Iraqi Kurdistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Tehran has pressured both the Iraqi central government and the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRG]] to disarm "terrorist secessionist groups," leading to increasing incursions into the KRI by Iranian-backed Shiite militias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Internal Divisions
The situation is compounded by [[internal_divisions_within_iraqi_kurdistan | entrenched divisions within the Kurdish population in Iraq]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The two main factions are:
*   **Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP)**: Currently controls the presidency and government, and is the largest party in the Kurdish Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)**: Traditionally held the Iraqi Federal presidency and has increasingly turned to Iraq's Arab community and Tehran for support, extending Baghdad and Tehran's political and strategic reach into the Kurdish area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Other Destabilizing Factors
Concerns about widespread corruption and a declining human rights situation also contribute to the region's instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## US Assistance and Outlook

The alleged plea for help from Prime Minister Masrour Barzani to the United States paints a stark picture of the region "bleeding economically and haemorrhaging politically," with claims that the crisis could lead to the collapse of Kurdistan and even the Iraqi federal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

However, observers express doubts about the likely impact of US assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>:
*   While the US maintains an active interest, providing aid, supporting Kurdish militia forces, and maintaining a diplomatic presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, many feel it is not as engaged as it could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   US influence has steadily waned since its formal withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   Neighboring Iran has become a more prevalent actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   Many argue that Washington is more focused on other issues like the war in Ukraine and Chinese military action against Taiwan, lacking the political capability or diplomatic bandwidth to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Despite the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRI]]'s historical resilience, even with essential outside support, it is now far weaker than just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Under threat from Baghdad and Tehran, and internally divided, its days as a "country-in-waiting" may have ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

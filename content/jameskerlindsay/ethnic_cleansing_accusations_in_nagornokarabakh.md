On September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan launched a major new attack on the Armenian-inhabited breakaway region of [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite fears of a bitter new war, the territory surrendered by the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Since then, tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians have been leaving the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Armenia has described this exodus as [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]], while Azerbaijan insists that people are leaving voluntarily and are not being forced out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## What is Ethnic Cleansing?

Conflicts throughout history have significantly impacted civilian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. However, terms like "genocide" and "ethnic cleansing" are relatively recent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While "genocide" is clearly defined by the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, there is no specific convention defining [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The term "[[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]]" emerged in the 1990s during the [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | wars in former Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In 1992, a UN commission of experts provided the most widely accepted description, defining it as "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons or given groups from the area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Methods for achieving this can include:
*   Murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Sexual assaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Severe injury to civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Confinement of civilian populations in ghetto areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Forcible displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   Deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   Destruction of property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

Determining what constitutes [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] is not always straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The recent conflict in [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] has brought this issue to international attention, sparking debate over whether the exodus of Armenians amounts to [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Historical Context of the Conflict

The [[historical_context_of_the_nagornokarabakh_conflict | conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh]] has a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The region, located in the South Caucasus, has been traditionally inhabited predominantly by ethnic Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

During the Soviet era, following the incorporation of the Caucasus into the Soviet Union and the creation of the Armenian and Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republics in the early 1920s, [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] was granted autonomy within Azerbaijan as the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Post-Soviet Wars

Upon the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] sought to break away, declaring independence and, with support from Armenia, fought and won a three-year war against Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This war resulted in Armenian forces securing control over [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] and overrunning surrounding Azerbaijani districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This led to the displacement of up to a million ethnic Azeris, an act that Azerbaijan has long referred to as [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Although the UN Security Council recognized Azerbaijan's sovereignty over [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] during the war, international efforts to negotiate a settlement in the years that followed were unsuccessful, leading to extreme hostility between the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### The [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | Nagorno-Karabakh War of 2020]]

By the late 2000s, Azerbaijan, enriched by Caspian oil and gas exports, began building up its armed forces, prompting fears of a policy to retake control by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. After growing incidents, including a brief four-day conflict in 2016, a new war erupted in September 2020 when Azerbaijan launched a full-scale attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Azerbaijani forces seized back occupied districts and moved into [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Just as Azerbaijan seemed poised to overrun the region, [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia brokered a ceasefire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | agreement]] included a humanitarian corridor between Armenia and [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] overseen by Russian peacekeepers, and Armenia agreed to open talks on giving Azerbaijan overland access to its exclave of Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Failed Peace Efforts and Blockade

Following the ceasefire, the European Union took the lead in efforts to negotiate a [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | final peace agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Armenia accepted Azerbaijan's sovereignty over the area and sought some form of autonomy for the inhabitants of [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. However, Azerbaijan steadfastly refused any special status or self-rule for the Armenian community, with President Ilham Aliyev insisting they would have the same rights as other Azerbaijani citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Tensions escalated, leading to fighting along the [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | border between Armenia and Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. In late 2022, Baku imposed a blockade on [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]], restricting access to food, electricity, and humanitarian aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Many viewed this as an attempt to starve [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] into submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## The September 2023 Assault and Exodus

Fears of a renewed military operation by Azerbaijan grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Despite pleas for restraint from the EU and US, the assault began on September 19, 2023, with heavy bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Baku claimed it was responding to "terrorist provocations," but Azerbaijan's actions drew widespread international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. While many Western governments criticized the use of force, they generally maintained Azerbaijan's sovereignty over [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan condemned the attack but made it clear that Armenia would not intervene, recognizing that Armenia was outgunned and any attempt to save [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] would lead to a wider war and potential territorial losses for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The assault was short, with the Armenian leadership in [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] surrendering within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The crisis continued as tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians began fleeing Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Within a week, an estimated 50,000 of the territory's 120,000 inhabitants had entered Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This mass exodus led to claims, notably by the Armenian prime minister, of [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | Ethnic Cleansing]] or Voluntary Departure?

### Azerbaijan's Stance

The Azerbaijani government has strongly rejected accusations of [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]], calling them a "national insult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Baku insists that its troops have not forced people to leave and that many Armenians are departing voluntarily after being defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They state that Armenians are not in danger and have broadcast messages welcoming them to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Azerbaijan has also shown police handing out water to those leaving and released pictures of talks with Armenian leaders from [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] to suggest fair treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. However, an Azerbaijani police force did arrest a former senior [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] leader as he attempted to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### The Counter-Argument

Many others insist that what is happening constitutes [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. They argue that one must look at the broader situation, pointing out that Azerbaijan first imposed a blockade to "starve the Armenian community into submission" before launching a military attack clearly aimed at retaking civilian areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Azerbaijan chose violence over peaceful resolution, despite having effectively regained control three years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Even if there hasn't been a systematic effort by Azerbaijani troops to force people out, reports of serious atrocities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Given the long and brutal history of the conflict and dehumanizing language often used by senior Azerbaijani leaders against Armenians, many Armenians feel the danger of retribution is too great to risk, leaving them with no choice but to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## International View and Legal Status

The two sides hold very different views on whether the current situation amounts to [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Azerbaijan asserts voluntary departures, while Armenia claims Azerbaijan's actions, including the violent settlement, made the mass exodus inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

An agreed international view on the situation seems unlikely, as many countries remain quiet, and political alliances make a UN Security Council resolution improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While other bodies like the Council of Europe or the European Parliament might issue positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, without a specific crime of [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]], a definitive answer in a court of law is improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The closest legal action would likely be prosecutions for crimes against humanity or genocide, though many are skeptical of this occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## [[future_implications_for_armenians_in_azerbaijan | Future Implications for Armenians in Azerbaijan]]

The conflict over the status of [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] is now over, with Azerbaijan securing a decisive victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The Republic of Artsakh, as the area was known to Armenians, no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Hopes for independence or joining Armenia are gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

However, genuine questions remain about the [[future_implications_for_armenians_in_azerbaijan | future of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The critical question is whether any Armenians will stay, and more importantly, whether those who have left will ever return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The Azerbaijani government insists Armenians are welcome to remain and return, but the genuineness of this statement is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Sceptics suggest it's merely to quell international criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

Ultimately, whether there will be meaningful steps to welcome Armenians back, or if any will return, remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Many suspect it won't happen, as Azerbaijanis are unlikely to mourn the departure of Armenians after decades of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Furthermore, given Baku's refusal to outline steps for meaningful self-rule, few Armenians are likely to want to return anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

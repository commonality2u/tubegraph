Bashkortostan, officially the Republic of Bashkortostan, is a federal subject of Russia located in the southern Ural Mountains, near Russia's southern border with Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>. It is Russia's sixth-largest republic by area, amounting to 143,000 square kilometres (55,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:06">[02:34:06]</a>. With four million inhabitants, it ranks first in population among Russian republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:06">[02:44:06]</a>.

## Ethnic Diversity

Like the rest of Russia, Bashkortostan is ethnically diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>. While ethnic Russians comprise the majority in Russia, Bashkortostan also has a significant proportion of ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>. The 2010 census indicated that ethnic Russians are the largest group in Bashkortostan, making up 36% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>.

The ethnic Bashkir, a Turkic group, constitute approximately 30% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:05">[02:58:05]</a>. They speak a language closely related to Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Tatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:08">[03:04:08]</a> and are predominantly Sunni Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:14">[03:08:14]</a>. Tatars, another Muslim Turkic community, comprise a quarter of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:04">[03:14:04]</a>. [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | Interethnic tensions]] have grown in the region, particularly between the Bashkirs and the Tatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:09">[06:38:09]</a>.

## Economic Landscape

Economically, Bashkortostan possesses considerable mineral wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>. This includes oil and gas deposits, as well as iron ore, manganese, and copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:02">[03:25:02]</a>. The republic also has a significant manufacturing base and extensive agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:08">[03:29:08]</a>.

However, there has been growing unhappiness regarding the region's economic exploitation, which has been linked to substantial environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:07">[06:29:07]</a>.

## Historical Background

Bashkortostan boasts a rich and complex history spanning many centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>.

### Early Migrations and Conquests

*   **7th Century:** Various Turkic-speaking tribes, including the Bashkirs, migrated to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:06">[03:39:06]</a>.
*   **1235:** The Mongols conquered the Bashkirs, and the area became part of the Kipchak Khanate, also known as the Golden Horde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:06">[03:50:06]</a>.
*   **Later:** The region fell under the control of the Kazan Khanate, a successor state of the Mongols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:04">[03:59:04]</a>.

### Integration into Imperial Russia

*   **16th Century:** Russian forces under Ivan the Terrible began to expand into the Urals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:07">[04:05:07]</a>.
*   **1557:** Despite fierce resistance, the Bashkirs were eventually conquered, becoming part of Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:01">[04:13:01]</a>.
*   **Centuries that Followed:** Ethnic Russians started to settle in the sparsely populated region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:01">[04:20:01]</a>. The Bashkirs repeatedly rebelled against Russian rule over the next three hundred years, with major uprisings in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, but the region remained firmly under imperial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:02">[04:26:02]</a>.

### The Soviet Era and Post-Soviet Autonomy

*   **1917 Russian Revolution:** Russia collapsed into civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:07">[04:45:07]</a>.
*   **Idel-Ural State:** The wider region declared its autonomy as the Idel-Ural State, bringing together many ethnic groups including the Bashkirs and Tatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:05">[04:52:05]</a>.
*   **Bashkiria:** Bashkir nationalists soon created a separate entity named Bashkiria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:03">[05:01:03]</a>.
*   **1919:** Both territories were short-lived as the Red Army overran the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:02">[05:05:02]</a>.
*   **Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR):** A new Bashkir ASSR was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the largest top-level republic of the new Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Decades:** The Bashkir ASSR underwent significant economic development with growing mining and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:06">[05:24:06]</a>.
*   **Weakening Soviet Union:** Ethnic Bashkirs began to push for greater language and cultural rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>.
*   **Post-1991:** Following the end of the USSR in December 1991, the Bashkir ASSR (also known as Bashkiria) was renamed Bashkortostan, a nod to its Turkic heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:07">[05:39:07]</a>.
*   **1994 Agreement with Moscow:** Bashkortostan signed a new agreement granting it extensive autonomy within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:04">[05:52:04]</a>. This deal also gave it complete control over its natural resources and environmental protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>.

### Growing Discontent

Over the three decades since the 1994 agreement, the situation in Bashkortostan has become increasingly strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:06">[06:07:06]</a>. There has been a steady rolling back of the republic's autonomy, with power increasingly centralized in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:02">[06:15:02]</a>. This, combined with economic exploitation, environmental damage, and [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | interethnic tensions]], has fueled Bashkir resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:07">[06:29:07]</a>.

Support for increased language and cultural rights has resurged, and social and ecological movements have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:04">[06:47:04]</a>. One notable group, Bashkort, was banned in 2020 for extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:04">[06:57:04]</a>. The ongoing war in Ukraine has further exacerbated tensions, as Russia's outlying regions and ethnic communities have been disproportionately affected by casualties and reduced government spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:06">[07:04:06]</a>.

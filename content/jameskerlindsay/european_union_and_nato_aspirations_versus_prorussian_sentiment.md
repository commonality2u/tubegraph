Georgia finds itself in a complex and confusing geopolitical landscape, facing accusations of drifting towards Russia despite its stated aspirations for [[European Union and NATO membership prospects for Moldova and Romania | European Union]] (EU) membership and the ongoing Russian occupation of parts of its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Historical Context

In 2008, Georgia fought a brief but brutal war against Russia, which resulted in Moscow recognizing the independence of two Georgian regions: Abkhazia and South Ossetia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. These areas, making up about 20% of Georgia's territory, remain under Russian military control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

After declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, Georgia initially joined the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, the country faced civil war and breakaway attempts by South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which ended with Kremlin-brokered ceasefires policed by Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Relations with Moscow were severely strained, but President Eduard Shevardnadze, while pro-Western, attempted to maintain working ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## The Saakashvili Era (2003-2013): Western Alignment

Everything changed with the 2003 Rose Revolution, which peacefully overthrew Shevardnadze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Mikheil Saakashvili became president, promising major reforms and vowing to move Georgia closer to the [[European Union and NATO membership prospects for Moldova and Romania | European Union]] and [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This led to a sharp deterioration in relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

The 2008 war marked a decisive break, with Tbilisi cutting diplomatic ties to Moscow and withdrawing from the CIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, Saakashvili's standing was damaged amidst accusations of recklessly stirring tensions and his administration faced allegations of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## The Georgian Dream Era (2012-Present): A Shifting Stance

In 2012, Saakashvili's party was defeated by the Georgian Dream coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Despite its billionaire leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili, having made his fortune in post-Soviet Russia, the new government initially maintained the country's pro-Western orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. In 2014, Georgia signed an Association Agreement with the EU, including a significant trade partnership, and opened a joint training and evaluation center with [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

However, in contrast to the previous administration, Georgian Dream adopted a more conciliatory approach towards Russia, aiming to normalize relations by focusing on trade, travel, and humanitarian cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This included refusing to impose sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Crimea in 2014, unlike EU and [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Growing Accusations of Pro-Russian Sentiment

While the government argued this was a pragmatic approach, the opposition increasingly accused it of pro-Russian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Concerns grew about the government's domestic political record, with allegations of backsliding on democratic principles, such as judicial independence and media freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. There were also signs of growing Russian disinformation aimed at encouraging extremism and anti-Western messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Post-Ukraine Invasion (2022)

Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Georgia supported Ukraine and condemned the attack, voting in favor of UN resolutions against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, it still refused to impose sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Georgia applied to join the [[European Union and NATO membership prospects for Moldova and Romania | European Union]] alongside Moldova and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. While Ukraine and Moldova were granted candidacy, the EU outlined 12 priorities for Georgia to address, including democratic reforms, improving the rule of law, and countering foreign disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

A major point of contention arose when the government introduced controversial legislation requiring organizations receiving over 20% of their income from external sources to register as "agents of foreign influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This law closely mirrored similar legislation in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Initially, facing significant internal opposition and criticism from the EU and United States, the government dropped the plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. In December 2023, Georgia was formally granted EU candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

However, just months later, the government reintroduced the controversial foreign agents legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Despite mass demonstrations and strong criticism from the EU and US, the government refused to back down, overriding the pro-Western president's veto and passing the law on May 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

This act further fueled the view that the government is under Moscow's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The government denies this, calling such claims opposition disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Yet, its rhetoric has taken a distinctly pro-Russian turn, incorporating "strange conspiracy theories and Kremlin disinformation talking points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. For instance, Bidzina Ivanishvili has accused a "Global War Party" of being behind the conflict in Ukraine and forcing Georgia and Russia to war in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Competing Interests and Future Orientation

The situation in Georgia is highly complex and open to interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. While the current developments could signify a drift towards Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, another explanation is that the government is attempting to strengthen its position before parliamentary elections later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This strategy includes hindering the opposition and shoring up its base, possibly through measures like new anti-LGBT legislation which resonates with older, socially conservative voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

This approach, however, directly contradicts the demands of Georgia's Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Support for EU membership in Georgia is as high as 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, presenting the government with a serious dilemma: it risks losing power unless it can reduce public support for EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

This situation creates an ideal opportunity for Moscow to exert influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Unlike the EU, Russia does not condition its support on rule of law or democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. While it may seem unrealistic for Georgia to seek closer ties with Russia given the occupation of its territory, the situation in nearby Moldova shows that significant pro-Russian support can exist even with Russian territorial occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

Moscow's primary goal may not be a complete Georgian realignment, but rather to divide society enough to reduce Western influence and high levels of support for Euro-Atlantic integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This aim increasingly appears to align with the practical needs of the Georgian government, even if not its stated policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

As Georgia approaches pivotal elections, its president, Salome Zourabichvili, is leading efforts to challenge the government and return Georgia to a European path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The coming months are likely to determine Georgia's future orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

The **[[colonial_legacy_and_its_impact_on_cameroons_conflict | Colonial History of Cameroon]]** significantly shaped its present-day challenges, particularly the ongoing [[cameroons_anglophone_crisis | Anglophone Crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Cameroon, considered one of Africaâ€™s most diverse countries with over 250 ethnolinguistic groups, has French and English as its two official languages, a direct result of its colonial past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### German Colonization

Cameroon, historically sitting on a key trade route between South, Central, and West Africa, began its modern colonial history in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. In 1884, the Berlin Conference awarded Germany a territory known as Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. German rule, however, was short-lived, lasting only thirty years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

### World War I and Partition

At the start of the First World War, Britain and France invaded the German territory, dividing it between themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. France seized most of the land, while Britain took approximately 20%, an area that bordered [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]], its largest colony in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This partition was formalized in 1922 when the League of Nations awarded Britain and France the mandate to administer what became known as the British and French Cameroons, thereby solidifying the linguistic division that lies at the core of present-day issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### British Administration and Internal Divisions

Britain continued its rule, overseeing the administration of its portion from neighboring [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. The British territory was further divided into two parts:
*   **North Cameroon**: Predominantly Muslim, sharing ethnic links with the Hausa and Fulani populations in northern [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **South Cameroon**: Primarily Christian and animist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

This internal division by the British would become highly significant during decolonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

### Decolonization and Independence

After the Second World War, as decolonization gained momentum, the British and French Cameroons became UN trust territories, setting the stage for decisions about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

On January 1, 1960, the French Cameroons achieved independence, becoming the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Questions then arose regarding the future of the British Cameroons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The United Nations dispatched missions to assess the situation, ultimately offering North and South Cameroon two options for their future:
*   Join neighboring [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]], which was also preparing for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   Unite with the newly independent Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

Independence was not an option, as the two territories were deemed too small and weak to be viable states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

On February 11, 1961, referendums were held in both British Cameroons territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   The population in North Cameroon voted to join [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]], officially uniting on May 31, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   South Cameroon chose to unite with Cameroon, with 70% voting in favor, largely due to fears of being overwhelmed within [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

Following negotiations that many Anglophone Cameroonians later considered illegitimate, the two parts formed the Federal Republic of Cameroon on October 1, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

### Post-Unification Tensions

Initially, Anglophones seemed to be welcomed into the new nation, with some holding high office, including Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. However, tensions soon emerged as the autocratic Francophone president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, began centralizing power, which steadily reduced Anglophone influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. This culminated on May 20, 1972, when a referendum abolished the federation and expanded presidential power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Subsequently, the English-speaking areas, now divided into two provinces, steadily lost control, a trend that continued after Paul Biya took office in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. These historical developments, rooted in the [[colonial_legacy_and_its_impact_on_cameroons_conflict | colonial legacy]], laid the groundwork for the modern-day [[the_anglophone_crisis_in_cameroon | Anglophone Crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

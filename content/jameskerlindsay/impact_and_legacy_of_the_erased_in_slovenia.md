Imagine waking up to find your entire identity deleted, your familiar country suddenly foreign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This scenario became a harsh reality for tens of thousands of Yugoslavs living in Slovenia, who were deliberately 'erased' from official records, marking a serious [[human_rights_violations_in_postindependence_slovenia | human rights violation]] following Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Background to the Erasure

The question of what happens to citizens from one part of a political union living in a breaking-away territory is a key aspect of any independence process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While extreme cases can lead to violence or [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, even peaceful transitions can result in serious issues, turning full members of society into "unwanted foreigners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the early 1990s serves as a significant example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. While the brutal conflicts of the federation's collapse are well-known, Slovenia's attempt to remove the identity of a large number of Yugoslavs on its territory remains less documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Slovenia's Demographics and Economic Migration
Slovenia, located in Southeast Europe, is a relatively small country, the 150th largest member of the United Nations by area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> and 149th by population with approximately 2.1 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. According to the 2002 census, ethnic Slovenians constituted 83% of the population. The largest minorities included Serbs (around 2%), Croats (1.8%), and Muslims (mainly Bosniaks, 1.6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Historically, Slovenia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, then became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. After World War II, it became one of the six republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. As the most economically advanced part of the federation, Slovenia attracted around 200,000 economic migrants from other parts of Yugoslavia, especially Croatia and Bosnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Slovenia's Independence and the Erasure
The death of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980 initiated a process of state collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. By late 1990, Slovenia held an independence referendum where 96% voted to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Slovenia declared independence on June 25, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Although the Yugoslav National Army attempted to prevent the secession, a ceasefire was agreed within days due to greater challenges in Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Slovenia was effectively allowed to pursue its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

As part of its state-building process, Slovenia passed legislation requiring all Yugoslav citizens living in the country to apply for citizenship by December 26, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While 170,000 people applied, tens of thousands missed the deadline, often unaware of its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Some applications were also rejected, particularly for those who had served in the Yugoslav Army during the secession attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

In February 1992, the Slovenian government ordered that those who had not applied for citizenship be deleted from the list of permanent residents and registered as foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Their Slovenian documents, such as identity cards or driver's licenses, were annulled, with reports of documents being shredded in front of their owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. In total, 25,671 people, or about one percent of the population, were affected and became known as "the erased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Catastrophic Consequences for "The Erased"
The impact on "the erased" was devastating:
*   **Loss of Services**: They were deprived of access to state services, including pensions, state housing, healthcare, and other social rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Employment and Poverty**: Many lost their jobs and found it impossible to secure new employment without proof of the right to work. This often led to families being reduced to poverty, without access to unemployment benefits or state aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Education**: Children were even denied education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Statelessness and Deportation**: In severe cases, those born in Slovenia but not registered elsewhere in the federation became effectively [[the_erased_statelessness_and_loss_of_identity | stateless persons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Many were forced to leave the country, either returning to war-torn Yugoslavia or emigrating elsewhere in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Others were simply deported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Legal and Political Struggle
For years, the Slovenian Government showed little interest in resolving the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Slovenian Constitutional Court Rulings
In 1999, the issue was brought before the Slovenian Constitutional Court, which ruled the deletion unlawful and ordered the government to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The government responded with new legislation offering a three-month window for citizenship applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, but it failed to address past problems or allow expelled individuals to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
Four years later, the Constitutional Court issued another ruling stating that the rights of those affected should be applied retroactively to the date of deletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Despite a new window for regularization, the government still refused retrospective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Thousands continued to face problems, even those who secured their status, lacking full state pensions or compensation for their suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Politicisation and Public Sentiment
The issue became increasingly politicized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Many ordinary Slovenes, in a country seeking to disassociate from its Yugoslav past, held little sympathy for "the erased," often viewing them as foreign economic migrants or even enemies of the state who had tried to deny an independent Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This sentiment was underscored in an April 2004 referendum where 94% voted 'No' on restoring rights to "the erased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## International Pressure and Partial Resolution
With Slovenia joining the European Union on May 1, 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, the government faced increasing pressure from human rights organizations and international bodies like the United Nations and the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### European Court of Human Rights Intervention
In 2006, eleven of "the erased" brought their case before the European Court of Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Four years later, the court ruled in their favor, a decision challenged by Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. In 2012, the Grand Chamber of the Court confirmed that Slovenia had violated Articles 8, 13, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantee respect for private and family life, the right to an effective remedy, and the prohibition of discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Slovenia was given a year to set up a compensation scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> but failed to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Consequently, in 2014, the Court ordered Slovenia to pay nearly a quarter of a million euros in compensation to the applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Facing a "massive wave of cases," the Slovenian Government finally decided to comply with the rulings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. A compensation scheme was established, paying out 22 million euros to approximately 5,300 people by February 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe declared its satisfaction that Slovenia's measures were satisfactory, considering the matter closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Continuing Legacy and Unresolved Issues
Despite the rulings and compensation, the matter continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Many affected individuals are still denied justice, deemed ineligible for the scheme or unable to afford legal fees to file a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Even three decades after the events, many of "the erased" continue their fight for justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The case of Slovenia provides a complex insight into the challenges faced by people following the breakup of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. While Slovenia avoided the brutal genocides and [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | ethnic cleansings]] seen elsewhere in Yugoslavia (and the vast majority of Yugoslavs in Slovenia were granted full citizenship), a minority faced severe [[human_rights_violations_in_postindependence_slovenia | human rights violations]] that successive governments initially refused to address, only acting when faced with significant financial penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The story of "the erased" remains a poignant, lesser-known chapter of the chaos and conflict that followed the [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | collapse of Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

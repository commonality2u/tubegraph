Serbia's relationship with Russia is often perceived as exceptionally close, a view strengthened by Serbia's refusal to impose sanctions on Russia following the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_serbia_russia_relations | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, reports suggesting Serbia has supplied arms to Ukraine indicate a more complex situation than initially apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. What appears to be close links can, in fact, conceal a more intricate dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Historical Ties and Evolving Relations

### Early Connections
After centuries under Ottoman rule, an uprising in Serbia in 1804 saw Imperial Russia become involved, viewing itself as a protector of Slavic Christian peoples in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. In 1829, following a Russo-Turkish war, Serbia gained autonomy within the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Complete independence was achieved in 1878 after another Russian-Ottoman war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. By the early 20th century, Serbia and Russia were close allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This alliance contributed to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, when Russia came to Serbia's aid after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union
Despite strong Russian support at the war's start, the picture changed radically by its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Russia fell to communist rule in 1917 and exited the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Meanwhile, Serbia united with other South Slavic nations to form the Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Relations between Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and the Russian-dominated Soviet Union were limited, with the Yugoslav monarchy fearing communism and keeping its distance from Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Diplomatic relations were not established until 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The Second World War altered the situation dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, communist Partisan forces, allied to the Soviet Union, became the main resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. They seized power in 1945, establishing a communist state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, disagreements between Tito and Stalin led to Yugoslavia breaking away from the Soviet Bloc in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Though relations improved after Stalin's death in 1953, Yugoslavia remained outside Soviet control for the rest of the Cold War, becoming a founder member of the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Post-Cold War Era and Kosovo
The disintegration of the Soviet Union in the 1990s coincided with Yugoslavia sinking into war, as four of its six republics broke away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. As the Serbian-dominated remnant of Yugoslavia fought to retain control of Serbian areas, tensions with the West grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević sought Russian support, but Moscow's post-Cold War weakness limited its ability to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

This pattern repeated during the 1999 Kosovo conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Despite Russia's strong opposition to NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia, it could do little to prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. After Serbia capitulated, Kosovo was put under UN administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo issue]] profoundly shaped contemporary Serbian-Russian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. When status talks began in 2006, Kosovo Albanians, supported by the US, UK, and France, sought independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Serbia, now backed by a more assertive Russia under Vladimir Putin, advocated for autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. With no agreement reached, Kosovo declared independence in February 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Belgrade has since relied on Moscow to block Kosovo's membership in the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Contemporary Dynamics (Pre-Ukraine War)

### Political and Economic Leverage
The apparent flourishing of Serbian-Russian relations after 2008 included high-level visits and significant Russian political, economic, and social leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This involved Russia taking control of Serbia's state energy provider and expanding its media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. However, Serbian officials privately complained about negative Russian influence, particularly on the economy, arguing that Western investment brought jobs and growth, while Russian involvement provided little benefit beyond cheap fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Security Cooperation and Foreign Policy Stance
While some observed growing Russian-Serbian security cooperation, including a humanitarian relief center in southern Serbia, this was overshadowed by increasing engagement between Serbia and NATO, including regular joint military exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. During this period, Serbia pursued an "equidistant" foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. It sought close relations with both Russia (for support on Kosovo) and the West, while also valuing ties with China and the global South as allies against Kosovo's recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Serbia hosted a Non-Aligned Movement summit again in late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### [[serbian_internal_politics_and_public_opinion_on_russia | Public Opinion]]
[[serbian_internal_politics_and_public_opinion_on_russia | Public opinion]] in Serbia was less supportive of Russia than it might have seemed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. While pro-Russian sentiment existed among the nationalist right and the Orthodox Church, many Serbs were primarily drawn to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Polling indicated a preference for EU membership over closer ties with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Furthermore, few Serbs spoke Russian, preferring to study English or German <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Impact of the Ukraine War on Serbia-Russia Relations

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 placed Serbia in a challenging position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Serbia sought to balance its stance, refusing to impose sanctions on Russia and maintaining high-level contacts with the Russian government, unlike most other European states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

However, Serbia's position was less pro-Russian than it appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It openly condemned the Russian invasion, took in Ukrainian refugees, provided humanitarian aid, and pledged support for Ukraine's postwar recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. A significant revelation came from the British *Financial Times*, reporting that Serbia, a major arms producer, had supplied Ukraine with over $800 million worth of ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Despite this, the Serbian government continued to insist on a strong relationship with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Days after the *Financial Times* report, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić welcomed the Russian deputy foreign minister to Belgrade and praised the country's ties to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The new Serbian government, formed just months prior, included figures with very close links to Russia, such as Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin, who has been sanctioned for his Moscow ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Analysis and Future Implications

The relationship between Serbia and Russia is not straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The argument that Serbia is merely reverting to traditional pro-Russian sympathies has flaws, as the two countries have had profound differences at various times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Suggestions of "Slavic or Orthodox unity" are too simplistic, as many Slavic and Orthodox countries now have strained relations with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Similarly, the idea that the relationship is solely driven by Kosovo is incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. It is unlikely Russia would reverse its position on Kosovo even if Serbia turned against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

Instead, the real issue appears to be [[serbian_internal_politics_and_public_opinion_on_russia | changing public opinion]] within Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The West's support for Ukraine's use of force to protect its territorial integrity, contrasted with NATO's bombing of Serbia for a similar goal, has fueled anger and accusations of double standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Many Serbs seem to be taking Russia's side not as an endorsement of Moscow, but as a protest against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The Ukraine conflict is contributing to growing [[history_of_political_instability_in_serbia | political and social polarization in Serbia]], with potentially serious consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While the Serbian leadership may remain broadly pro-European despite concerns about authoritarianism, [[serbian_internal_politics_and_public_opinion_on_russia | public opinion]] appears to be shifting in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, with long-term implications for Serbia, the Balkans, and Europe more generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Operation Storm was a major Croatian military offensive launched in August 1995 to retake control of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), a territory that had unilaterally declared independence four years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The offensive, which lasted just three days, resulted in the area returning to Croat control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A quarter of a century later, the events remain controversial, and annual celebrations to mark the operation have become a point of friction between Croatia and neighbouring Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Historical Context

Croatia is located in Southeast Europe, covering 56,000 square kilometers, and was the 124th largest of the 193 United Nations members as of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Its population is approximately 4.1 million, with ethnic Croats making up around 90% and ethnic Serbs around 4.5% according to the 2011 census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The history of the conflict can be traced back to 1918 when the territory of Croatia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929) following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. After World War II, Croatia became one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

By the late 1980s, the Yugoslav federation was under strain, and as Croatia sought a looser relationship or even independence, ethnic Serbs within Croatia began to consider their own position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Representing about 12% of Croatia's population, Serbs were primarily concentrated in three areas: Slavonia, Western Slavonia, and Krajina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

In July 1990, Croatia adopted a new constitution, which Croatian Serbs believed downgraded their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This led to the establishment of self-administered Serbian areas, starting with the "Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina" in December 1990, followed by Slavonia and Western Slavonia the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Fighting erupted as Croatian forces attempted to reassert control, marking the beginning of the Yugoslav wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

On June 25, 1991, Croatia declared independence alongside Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) intervened, but after a 10-day conflict and a ceasefire, Croatian Serb forces, supported by the now Serbian-controlled JNA, gained control of approximately a third of Croatia's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Over 200,000 Croats and non-Serbs were forcibly expelled from these captured areas, a policy later termed ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

In October 1991, Croatia formally broke away from Yugoslavia and launched a counter-offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In response, Croatian Serbs declared independence on December 19, 1991, establishing the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. An international ceasefire was agreed in early 1992, leading to the withdrawal of the JNA and the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission, UNPROFOR, around the Serb-controlled zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Despite the shift in international attention to Bosnia and Herzegovina, fighting continued in Croatia, with several major Croat offensives in 1993, some marked by extreme brutality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

A turning point came in March 1994 when the United States brokered a peace agreement between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims, allowing Croatia to focus more fully on the Serbian secession within its own borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. In early 1995, Croatia announced it would no longer permit UNPROFOR to operate on its territory, indicating a clear intent to retake the land by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## The Offensive: Operation Storm

The first phase of Croatia's military reassertion came in May 1995 with "Operation Flash," where 7,500 Croatian troops attacked Western Slavonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Croatia retook the territory within days, forcing the majority of the 14,000 Serbian inhabitants to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Despite Serbian retaliation by shelling Zagreb, the Croatian government proceeded with plans for the next phase: an attack on Krajina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

On July 31, 1995, the Croatian leadership, under President Franjo Tudjman, finalized plans to retake the territory and force out the Serbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Five days later, on August 4, Operation Storm began with a massive artillery bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Serbian resistance quickly crumbled, and between 200,000 and 250,000 people—the vast majority of the territory's inhabitants—fled the country as Croatian forces advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Within 72 hours, Operation Storm was complete, and Krajina was under Croatian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The attempted Serbian secession had been defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The war officially ended on November 12, 1995, with an agreement to reintegrate Slavonia, the last part of the defunct RSK, into Croatia, a process completed by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## [[international_legal_proceedings_from_the_conflict | Legal Proceedings]] and Controversy

In the aftermath of the conflict, pressure mounted for those responsible for crimes committed during the war to be tried at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The ICTY was established by the UN Security Council to prosecute war crimes and human rights abuses during the Yugoslav conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This led to the trial of RSK leaders and key Serbian figures, including Slobodan Milosevic, for crimes against humanity in Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

However, bringing Croatians to trial for their actions during Operation Storm proved more problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. While a 1996 Human Rights Watch report cataloged atrocities such as attacks on fleeing civilians and the torture and murder of Serbs who remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, Croatia firmly rejected claims by the ICTY that its leadership had engaged in a "joint criminal enterprise" to permanently rid the territory of its Serbian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Croatia maintained that the operation was entirely justified and that prosecuting its leaders was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Despite resistance, pressure on Zagreb continued to hand over those accused of war crimes, most notably General Ante Gotovina, a key Croatian commander in Operation Storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Gotovina was arrested in 2005, transferred to the ICTY, and in 2011, found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 24 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. However, in 2012, he and another general were controversially acquitted on appeal, leading to Gotovina's return to Croatia as a hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Further legal proceedings involved the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In 1999, Croatia launched a case against Serbia at the ICJ, accusing it of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Serbia filed a counter-claim, accusing Croatia of genocide during Operation Storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. In judgments delivered in 2008 and 2015, the ICJ ruled that while both sides had committed acts that could constitute genocide, there was no definitive proof of intent to destroy populations, only to force them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Therefore, neither could be considered to have contravened the genocide convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## [[impact_of_operation_storm_on_croatian_and_serbian_relations | Contested Legacy]]

Operation Storm remains a highly contested event. While Croatia celebrates it as 'Victory Day,' marking the end of the 'homeland war' for national independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, Serbia views it as a moment of national mourning when hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs were forced from their ancestral homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

> "While Serbia sees Victory Day as a provocative celebration of what is now widely accepted to have been an act of ethnic cleansing, it fails to acknowledge the ethnic cleansing that took place earlier in the conflict in Serb-held areas. Likewise, while Croatia may see Operation Storm as a legitimate military action to retake a secessionist territory, it completely overlooks the huge humanitarian costs of an offensive that saw two-thirds of the country's ethnic Serbs forced out from lands where their families had lived for hundreds of years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>

The differing narratives continue to fuel annual tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The events marking Operation Storm could become a source of reconciliation if both Serbia and Croatia were to reflect on the heavy cost of the entire conflict, not just on their own people, but on all affected populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

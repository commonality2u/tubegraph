[[Turkey Greece Relations | Relations between Greece and Turkey]] have long been characterized by a cyclical pattern of confrontation and rapprochement, largely shaped by [[historical_tensions_between_greece_and_turkey | historical perceptions]] and ongoing disputes in the Aegean Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While their differences are rooted in modern political and legal interpretations, a deeper look reveals how perceptions of the past fundamentally influence their approach to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Key Areas of Dispute

Following the [[Cyprus Dispute and its Impact | Cyprus conflict]] in the mid-1950s and the Turkish invasion in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, tensions extended to other areas, particularly within the Aegean Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Continental Shelf and Oil Exploration
The discovery of oil in the Aegean in the early 1970s led to significant contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Turkey's Argument**: The continental shelf (seabed) is an extension of the Anatolian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Greece's Argument**: The continental shelf belongs to the Greek islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
Greece attempted to bring this matter before the International Court of Justice, but the Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction without Turkey's agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. A new crisis erupted in March 1987 when Turkey began oil exploration in the Aegean, narrowly averting armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Exploratory talks on the continental shelf began in the early 2000s, but Greece maintained there was nothing to discuss regarding territorial waters or airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Territorial Waters and Airspace
Disputes over territorial waters and airspace also emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   The Treaty of Lausanne initially allowed Greece three nautical miles, extended to six miles in 1936 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   The 1983 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea permitted an extension to 12 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   Turkey argued that a 12-mile extension would effectively make the Aegean a "Greek lake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The Turkish parliament passed a resolution making any Greek extension a justification for war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   Rows also broke out over air traffic control in the Aegean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Militarization of Islands
The militarization of certain islands is another point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### "Grey Zones" Issue
In 1996, an incident involving a Turkish ship running aground on an uninhabited islet in the Aegean sparked the "Grey Zones" issue, as Greece insisted on its clear sovereignty over the territory while Ankara disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Rapprochement

In recent years, tensions have continued to rise:
*   In 2015, Ankara allowed over a million migrants to cross the Aegean in small boats, drawing international attention to strained relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   A 2017 visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Greece was marred when he called for the Treaty of Lausanne to be "modernized," which Greece interpreted as an attempt to open debate on boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   Turkey has become increasingly vocal about its territorial claims in the wider Mediterranean, fueled by growing energy finds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This included signing a maritime agreement with Libya covering an area claimed by Greece and launching oil exploration close to Greek islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Throughout 2022, incursions by Turkish military aircraft over the Aegean islands sharply increased, traditionally indicating broader tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

Despite these persistent issues, the centenary of the Treaty of Lausanne in 2023 saw a shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. A devastating earthquake in Turkey once again drove rapprochement, with Greece quickly sending emergency rescue teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This, combined with President Erdogan's re-election and domestic economic challenges, led him to mend relations with Western partners, including Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

During President Erdogan's visit to Greece on December 7, 2023, he called for the Aegean to become a "sea of peace" and stated that no problem was unsolvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis signed 15 bilateral agreements covering various areas from energy to agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. They also agreed on a non-binding 10-point declaration of friendly relations, committing to political dialogue, confidence-building measures, a joint action plan, and resolving disputes amicably through direct consultations or other UN Charter means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Outlook
While these efforts are welcomed, there is a sense of *déjà vu* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Without settling the outstanding bilateral issues in the Aegean, any new attempt at a fresh start is likely to only last until the next crisis, continuing the long cycle of ups and downs between these two Mediterranean neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

As global attention remains fixed on conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, the deteriorating situation in [[recent_fighting_in_sudan_and_potential_new_civil_war | Sudan]] is rapidly escalating into the world's worst [[humanitarian_impact_and_food_shortages_in_sudan | humanitarian crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Despite millions displaced and widespread starvation, many observers are calling it a "forgotten war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Why is Sudan Overlooked?

The question of why some conflicts receive widespread international attention while others do not is often asked in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Factors influencing this include:
*   **Geopolitical significance:** Situations touching on geopolitical factors or directly involving a great power or its close allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Economic effects:** Disrupting trade routes or access to vital resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Threat of spread:** Potential to become a regional or international war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Media and policy priorities:** Wars in more remote or less strategically significant areas naturally receive less attention, even if their effects are more catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Sudan is an excellent case in point, initially receiving considerable media coverage for the outbreak of its civil war, but now garnering almost no international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Sudan: Geography and Demographics

The Republic of Sudan is located in northeast Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Size:** Covering 1.8 million square kilometers (720,000 square miles), it is the world's 15th-largest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Borders:** It shares a Red Sea coast to its east and borders Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Chad, Libya, and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Population:** Approximately 46 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Ethnicity and Religion:** While almost all Sudanese are Sunni Muslims, the country is ethnically mixed, with a majority Arab population and about a third comprising sub-Saharan African groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## [[historical_background_to_sudans_conflict | Historical Context of Sudan's Conflicts]]

Sudan's history of conflict is deeply rooted in its diverse ethnic and religious makeup, exacerbated by external influences and internal power struggles.

### Early History and External Rule
Sudan's history spans thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It was once dominated by Ancient Egypt, followed by Christian Nubian rule, and by the 17th century, Islam had spread throughout its northern regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. In the early 19th century, the Ottoman Empire and its Egyptian vassal state expanded into Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. A revolt led by a local Muslim religious leader in 1881 prompted Britain to intervene, concerned about the Suez Canal and regional stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Under British colonial rule, attempts were made to integrate the predominantly Arab Muslim northern provinces with the sub-Saharan African tribes in the south, who followed Christianity and local faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Post-Colonial Civil Wars
Deep divisions emerged over Sudan's future during decolonization after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The South desired a federal structure or independence, fiercely opposed by the Muslim Arab North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **First Civil War (1955-1972):** Violence erupted in July 1955 when southern troops mutinied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Britain quickly withdrew, and Sudan gained independence on January 1, 1956, immediately plunging into a brutal civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. A peace deal in 1972 granted the South considerable self-rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Second Civil War (1983 onwards):** The discovery of oil deposits along the North-South boundary led the Northern-led central government to revoke the peace agreement and impose direct rule, including Islamic law, on southern areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This sparked a second civil war, with the Southern-led Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) gaining control of much of the South, supported by Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. By the late 1980s, it was Africa's longest-running conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Bashir's Rule and Darfur
In 1989, the Sudanese army staged a coup, installing a dictatorship under Colonel Omar Al-Bashir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Despite hopes of turning the tide, the SPLA maintained control over large parts of the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. By the turn of the millennium, the North faced increasing pressure:
*   Nearly fifty years of continuous war with the South had resulted in 2 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   A new, brutal conflict emerged in the western region of Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   Post-9/11, Washington focused on Bashir, who was accused of supporting Islamist terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

In January 2005, US-led talks resulted in a peace deal that paved the way for South Sudan's independence six years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, the situation in Darfur continued to worsen, with the Arab militia known as the Janjaweed waging a campaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing against sub-Saharan African groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Facing charges of crimes against humanity, Bashir eventually placed the Janjaweed under army control, renaming them the [[factions_within_sudans_military_and_power_struggles | Rapid Support Forces (RSF)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Path to the Current Conflict

Even after South Sudan's independence, new problems emerged. The loss of significant oil revenues forced the government to cut spending, leading to widespread opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Bashir's Ousting and Power Struggles
*   **2019 Coup:** Following massive street protests, the military ousted Bashir in April 2019 after 30 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Transitional Council:** Despite initial hopes for democracy, the military attempted to retain power. Under international pressure, they agreed to a power-sharing transitional council, which included armed forces commander General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (the RSF commander) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **2021 Military Coup:** Popular calls for democracy continued. Facing further protests, the military staged another coup on October 25, 2021, abolishing the transitional council and arresting the civilian prime minister. Burhan and Dagalo retook control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Growing Tensions Between Generals
Though they had close ties from the Darfur conflict, tensions soon grew between Burhan and Dagalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Burhan:** Enjoyed support from northern elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Dagalo:** From Darfur, viewed with suspicion, and tainted by allegations of corruption after seizing control of gold mines in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   Dagalo reinvented himself as a political figure, courting popular support, calling the coup a mistake, and accusing Burhan of being a radical Islamist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   Both men sought international support: Burhan fostered relations with Washington and the West, while Dagalo established close ties with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Outbreak of the Current Civil War (April 2023)

The growing power struggle erupted on April 15, 2023, with clashes between the army and the RSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Violence rapidly escalated, leading to increased casualties and tens of thousands fleeing Khartoum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Initial International Attention and Decline
Initially, the fighting attracted considerable international attention due to:
*   A large number of foreigners caught in the situation, leading many countries (US, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, India, among others) to conduct urgent evacuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   [[sudans_strategic_and_economic_significance | Sudan's strategic position]] on the Red Sea, a vital waterway, and its role as a conduit between North and Sub-Saharan Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   The factional links to Russia and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Despite efforts for ceasefires and peace talks, the conflict continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Media coverage soon drifted, especially after foreigners were evacuated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Policy attention shifted elsewhere, particularly after the surge in Middle East violence following Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Ongoing Conflict and Worsening Crisis

With little international focus now on Sudan, the situation on the ground has continued to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   Fighting continues in Khartoum and has spread to other parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   Calls for a ceasefire during Ramadan went unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   The conflict has become a proxy war, with members of Russia's Wagner Group (enlisted by Dagalo) fighting Ukrainian commandos (supporting the Army) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### The [[humanitarian_impact_and_food_shortages_in_sudan | Humanitarian Crisis]]

>[!WARNING] The civil war continues to take a severe toll, with at least 14,000 killed and tens of thousands wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, it is the broader effects of the conflict that are now causing the greatest concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

*   **Displacement:** Sudan now has the highest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the world, estimated at around 6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Additionally, 1.7 million people have fled the country, becoming refugees in neighboring states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Food Shortages:** Serious food shortages are particularly worrying due to the almost complete breakdown of law and order and central government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The country stands on the brink of starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
    *   The United Nations estimates that about half the country's population, approximately 25 million people (including 14 million children), need life-saving assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. These figures are expected to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
    *   Attacks on Red Sea shipping by Houthi forces in Yemen have severely curtailed ships reaching Port Sudan, limiting food imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
    *   Wider regional famines in recent years have led to lingering food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Darfur:** Fears are growing about the worsening situation in Darfur, with horrific acts of violence being reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

As the conflict approaches its second year, the UN has called for $4.1 billion US to help with the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. However, the UN Under-Secretary-General, Martin Griffiths, has noted the extraordinary difficulty in getting the international community to focus on Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The tragic reality is that with attention focused elsewhere, the world is paying little attention to this unfolding disaster in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In September 2023, a state visit by US President Joe Biden to Vietnam led to the signing of a comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This development is seen as a historic turnaround, given their past difficult relationship and ongoing ideological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The primary driver behind this closer [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | relationship]] is a shared security concern over [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China's growing regional and international significance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Historical Ties and Tensions

Vietnam, located in Southeast Asia, borders Cambodia, Laos, and China to its north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Its history shows deep influence from China, both politically and culturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. After centuries of Chinese influence, Vietnam came under direct Chinese rule until 938 CE, when it became a separate kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This relationship with its northern neighbor has remained complex and often conflictual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

During the First Indochina War, the People's Republic of China, along with the Soviet Union, supported Vietnamese guerilla forces from the Communist-controlled North against the French army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. China was instrumental in supporting the North during the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

However, relations between Vietnam and China have been strained since the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. A brief conflict occurred in 1979, followed by sporadic border skirmishes throughout the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Diplomatic relations were eventually restored in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## The South China Sea Dispute

Tensions have continued between Vietnam and China, particularly due to a steadily escalating dispute over the [[geopolitical_tensions_over_strategic_waterways | South China Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. China has been [[chinas_historical_claims_versus_international_law_in_the_south_china_sea | increasingly asserting its territorial claims]] in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This issue has been the key factor shaping the [[us_vietnam_relationship_post_vietnam_war | relationship between Vietnam and the United States]] over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The dispute has led to an increase in defence and security cooperation between Vietnam and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The US has provided Vietnam with military equipment and training, and the two countries have engaged in joint military exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Vietnam's Balancing Act

Despite the tensions, the relationship between Vietnam and China is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. China remains Vietnam's largest trading partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. As neighbors ruled by communist parties, they continue to share ideological and political similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Vietnam also has no desire for a full-scale [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | conflict with China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This defines the Vietnam-China relationship as a delicate balance of cooperation and rivalry, influenced by historical, economic, and geopolitical factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## China's Reaction to US-Vietnam Rapprochement

Beijing appears "rattled" by the strengthening ties between Vietnam and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This was evidenced in October 2023, just a month after President Biden's visit, when Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly made an appeal for Vietnam to recall their past "good times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. As tensions continue to escalate in the [[geopolitical_tensions_over_strategic_waterways | South China Sea]], it is expected that Vietnam will continue to move closer to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

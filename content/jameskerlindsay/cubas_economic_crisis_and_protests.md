In March 2024, widespread protests erupted in Cuba, sparked by growing food shortages and significant energy price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These demonstrations, a rare display of public unrest, occurred across several cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The Cuban government subsequently appealed to the United Nations for emergency assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> and accused the United States of orchestrating the unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Washington vehemently denied these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, but the accusations have further highlighted the long-standing tense [[USCuba relations and accusations of interference | relationship between the two countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Current Economic Crisis

Cuba is currently experiencing its most severe economic crisis since the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This crisis is attributed to a combination of factors, including the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation, and fuel shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The country continues to struggle under the enduring [[Impact of the US embargo on Cuba | US economic embargo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Key indicators of the crisis include:
*   **Fuel Price Increase** On March 1, 2024, the government imposed a 500% increase in fuel prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Widespread Shortages** The nation faces increasing shortages of essential items like baby milk and medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Aid Appeal** Cuba made an urgent and unprecedented plea to the United Nations World Food Program for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Power Outages** The country has been hit by recurrent waves of power outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

These severe problems have led to growing widespread anger among the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Protests and Government Response

Reports of protests initially emerged from Santiago de Cuba, the country's second-largest city, spreading to other towns and villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. While Cuban officials state that measures are being taken to address the nation's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, the demonstrations have further escalated tensions with Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

The Cuban government formally accused the United States of instigating the unrest and interfering in its internal affairs, summoning the most senior US diplomat in the country to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The US, in turn, officially denied any involvement, calling the accusations "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. However, American officials urged Havana to show restraint and affirmed their support for the Cuban people's right to democracy and fundamental freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Historical Context of Economic Struggles

Cuba's economic vulnerabilities were significantly exposed with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Prior to this, [[Cubas historical context and relations with Russia | Cuba's dependence on the Soviet Union]] and the Warsaw Pact allowed it to maintain a good standard of living despite the [[Impact of the US embargo on Cuba | US economic embargo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Following the Soviet Union's dissolution, Cuba lost its primary benefactor and faced severe hardships, including shortages of food, medicine, and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Although Havana implemented austerity measures and began to open its economy to tourism, investment, and private enterprise, Fidel Castro maintained tight control under his one-party system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This led Washington, supported by a vocal Cuban exile community, to harden its stance against the Castro regime, citing a lack of democracy and human rights restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. US Congress passed legislation to further isolate Cuba, even allowing punitive actions against governments and companies doing business with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While intended to destabilize the regime, these measures inadvertently encouraged Cuba to become more self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Relations briefly thawed under the Clinton and Obama administrations, with eased travel restrictions and attempts at normalizing relations, including reopening embassies in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. However, the core [[Impact of the US embargo on Cuba | embargo]] remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The Trump administration reversed many of these steps and tightened the embargo, citing human rights violations and Cuba's support for Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Despite the departure of Raul Castro in 2021, ending 60 years of Castro family rule, the Biden administration did not fully return to the Obama-era d√©tente, with the embargo largely intact due to continued concerns over human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## International Relations and Tensions

Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba maintained good relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This relationship became more prominent with the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Although Cuba abstained from the UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion, Moscow and Havana increased their economic, political, and military cooperation in the face of Western sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Reports of Cubans signing up for the Russian army further stoked tensions, despite Havana's insistence that it was not involved in the war and opposed recruitment of its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. In December 2023, a former US ambassador was arrested and charged with spying for Cuba over several decades, adding another layer of complexity to the already strained relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Outlook

The future of the unrest and its potential to challenge the ruling Communist Party remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. While Cuba has a history of suppressing dissent, historical precedents elsewhere indicate that such situations can escalate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Both Havana and Washington view the protests through the lens of a larger, long-term struggle for the Cuban people's right to self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

For Havana, the conflict is about a powerful neighbor with a history of interference and a "punishing and cruel embargo" imposed for daring to oppose its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For Washington, the confrontation represents ongoing efforts to dismantle a "crumbling one-party Communist regime" that has denied the Cuban people their democratic and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Turkey's relationship with the West, long considered integral due to its membership in NATO, the Council of Europe, and its status as an EU candidate, has become increasingly distant over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While some blame rests on European leaders, much of this estrangement is attributed to the [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | policies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, recent events suggest a potential desire to rebuild ties with traditional allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Historical Context

The Republic of Turkey, formally proclaimed on October 29, 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, has historically looked towards Europe and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Under Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), Turkey implemented radical social reforms, minimized Islam's role, and adopted a Latin script to align itself with Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

After World War II, Turkey further solidified its Western alignment:
*   **Council of Europe** Turkey became one of its first members in 1949, a body established to uphold democracy and human rights in Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **NATO** Three years later, in 1952, as the Cold War intensified, Turkey joined NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **European Economic Community (EEC)** In 1963, Turkey signed an association agreement with the EEC, the precursor to the European Union, with the hope of eventual membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Obstacles to Western Integration

Despite these steps, Turkey's path to closer Western integration faced several obstacles:
*   **Internal Political Instability** The country was plagued by political instability, including multiple military coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **External Tensions** Tensions with Greece over the Aegean Sea and the 1974 invasion of Cyprus also hampered membership prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Shifting Dynamics in the Early 2000s

By the late 1990s, the situation began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Although Turkey's EU application was rejected in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, a massive earthquake in Western Turkey in 1999 led to rapprochement with Greece, resulting in Athens dropping its objections to Turkish membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

The election of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) under [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] in November 2002 marked a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The new government prioritized EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, continued rapprochement with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, and supported a UN plan to reunite Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Although the UN effort failed, Turkey's constructive role was rewarded, and EU leaders agreed to open membership negotiations in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Turkey made progress by reforming its internal politics, reducing military power, and opening 16 of 33 chapters of the acquis communautaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Deterioration of Relations

By the end of the decade, problems emerged as [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] became increasingly authoritarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Gezi Park Protests (2013)** Mass protests erupted in May 2013, leading to Erdogan tightening his grip on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Attempted Coup (2016)** Following an attempted coup in July 2016, a massive crackdown on political opponents occurred, with purges in civil service, judiciary, military, and academia, and tens of thousands jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Erdogan also changed the constitution, creating a U.S.-style presidential system that significantly increased his personal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

These events severely impacted [[turkeys_diplomatic_crisis_with_the_west | Turkey's relationship with the West]]:
*   **EU Accession Talks** Membership talks with the EU stalled due to concerns about Turkey's democratic criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Migrant Crisis** EU-Turkey relations were strained by the 2015 migrant crisis, which saw a million people cross from Turkey into Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **U.S. Relations** Ties with Washington deteriorated as Turkey accused the U.S. of harboring Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blamed for the coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Russia Ties** Turkey's growing ties to Russia, underscored by its purchase of a Russian-made anti-aircraft system, caused concern in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Council of Europe Concerns** Turkey's place in the Council of Europe was questioned due to the arrest and indefinite detention of a leading business figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Turkey also faced criticism for pulling out of the Istanbul Convention protecting women's rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## The War in Ukraine and NATO Expansion

The start of the war in Ukraine brought relations to a head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Unlike the EU and U.S., Ankara refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, arguing it was acting as an intermediary, including brokering a deal to export Ukrainian grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

A significant geopolitical event occurred in May 2022 when Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO, abandoning long-standing neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Turkey initially opposed their membership, citing their failure to tackle Kurdish terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. While [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] eventually relented on Finland, he held firm on Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### The Vilnius NATO Summit

At the NATO Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] unexpectedly linked Sweden's NATO membership to Turkey's long-stalled EU membership talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This move, seen by some as political blackmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, was followed by a quick turnaround; after meeting with the Swedish prime minister and NATO Secretary General, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] agreed to forward Sweden's application to the Turkish Parliament for ratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Reasons for Diplomatic Shifts

The dramatic and swift change in Turkey's stance is attributed to several factors:
*   **Domestic Politics** The debate over Swedish membership coincided with [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]]'s re-election campaign, where he "played the nationalist card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Having secured another term, he felt able to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Economic Crisis** A more significant factor is Turkey's severe economic problems, including a persistent budget deficit, efforts to prop up the lira, and dangerously low foreign currency reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. With support from Gulf Arab states waning, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] appears to be seeking support from Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Recent Diplomatic Moves and Dividends

In response to these challenges, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] has made dramatic diplomatic moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>:
*   Approved Sweden's NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Expressed support for Ukrainian membership in NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Handed over Ukrainian prisoners of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

These actions have yielded early dividends, including high-profile meetings with EU officials and U.S. President Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The U.S. Administration also indicated its willingness to approve the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. There is also hope that Western partners will be more willing to assist Turkey if its economy enters a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Future of EU Accession Talks

Despite these recent improvements, a full renewal of EU accession talks is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Outstanding Issues** Serious problems remain, including Turkey's outstanding issues with its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Democratic Requirements** [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]]'s authoritarianism means Turkey does not meet the democratic criteria for membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Lack of Appetite** There is no significant appetite for Turkish membership within the EU, either among leaders or at the popular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Public support has steadily dropped since the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

Furthermore, there is an argument that [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] himself is not keen on full EU membership, valuing the validation of talks more than the necessary changes to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Both sides have been content to leave talks in limbo rather than formally break them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Moving forward, both Turkey and the EU seek to maintain good working relations while avoiding serious discussions about restarting accession negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. As such, while a "renewed relationship" is possible, full membership talks are carefully avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

While the steps taken at the NATO Summit were significant, given the damage of recent years, Western leaders are cautious about a new era of relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Building trust and addressing political and human rights shortcomings will require much more effort from Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The "charm offensive" by [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] suggests deep financial problems, leading many to wonder about the cost of this rediscovered friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Early 20th Century and French Mandate

[[Syrias history and political development | Syria]] and Lebanon were placed under a League of Nations mandate to France in 1920, following the First World War and the division of the Ottoman Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. At this time, Lebanon was separated from [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]], a decision that caused lingering resentment among many in [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]] who considered the area part of Greater [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The new state, known as "Greater Lebanon," extended beyond the predominantly Christian Mount Lebanon region to include Muslim areas to the north and south, and the Shia Muslim-dominated Bekaa Valley to the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. In 1926, a new constitution was introduced, and it became the Republic of Lebanon, though still formally under French rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Independence and the National Pact

Lebanon declared independence in 1943 during the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. To maintain the country's delicate religious balance, the main religious groups reached an unwritten understanding known as the National Pact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This pact established a power-sharing arrangement:
*   The President would always be a Maronite Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   The Prime Minister would be a Sunni Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   The Speaker of Parliament would be a Shia Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   Parliamentary seats were divided on a 6:5 ratio between Christians and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

Following the war, Lebanon became a founder member of the United Nations and experienced a period of prosperity, becoming an important commercial and cultural hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Challenges to the Political Structure

### 1958 Crisis
The first major problems emerged in 1958, driven by growing pan-Arabism. Many Sunni Muslims advocated for Lebanon to join the newly formed United Arab Republic, a union between [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]] and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. The Lebanese president requested U.S. intervention to preserve the country's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Impact of the Arab-Israeli Conflict
Lebanon was increasingly affected by the Arab-Israeli conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Waves of Palestinian refugees in 1948 and after the 1967 Six-Day War shifted the country's religious balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Palestinian groups, including the PLO, established bases in Lebanon and launched attacks against Israel from its southern border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### Civil War (1975-1989)
In 1975, fighting erupted between Palestinians and Christians, leading to a brutal and complex civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]] intervened in 1976 at the request of the Christian president, fighting Palestinian militias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Israel also invaded southern Lebanon in 1978 and launched a new campaign in 1982, pushing to Beirut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

## The Taif Agreement and Post-War Period

The civil war concluded in 1989 with the National Reconciliation Accord, commonly known as the Taif Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This agreement stipulated the withdrawal of [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]]n and Israeli forces, the disbandment of militias, and the introduction of important constitutional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

Under Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the country began rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. However, significant problems persisted:
*   Continued Israeli presence in the south (until May 2000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   Continued presence of Iranian-backed [[Hezbollahs influence in Lebanon | Hezbollah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   Continued [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]]n control over the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

[[Syrias history and political development | Syria]] maintained a strong presence until Hariri's assassination in 2005 led to massive demonstrations and [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]]'s withdrawal of troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Despite this, [[Syrias history and political development | Syria]] remained an influential factor through its links to [[Hezbollahs influence in Lebanon | Hezbollah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

## Current Political Landscape

In recent years, [[Hezbollahs influence in Lebanon | Hezbollah]] has gained significant ground in Lebanon. The group, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and E.U., has established a "state within a state," becoming one of the most heavily armed non-state actors globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. It holds seats in parliament, has ministers in government, and exerts control over many Lebanese institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Some argue that [[Hezbollahs influence in Lebanon | Hezbollah]] may attempt to take complete control of the country, which would have substantial implications and could lead to a major confrontation with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

The ongoing [[Lebanon economic crisis | economic crisis]] and growing financial pressure, exacerbated by the [[Impact of Syrian refugees on Lebanon | influx of over a million Syrian refugees]] since 2011, have put intolerable strain on the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. The government has been largely incapable of addressing the crisis, hampered by deep-rooted corruption and vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The situation raises concerns about civil disorder and a [[Potential for conflict in Lebanon | return to conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

Operation Storm was a major military offensive launched by [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] in August 1995 to regain control of the Republic of Serbian Krajina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This territory had unilaterally declared independence four years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The operation concluded in just three days, with the area returning to Croat control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A quarter of a century later, the events remain controversial, and annual celebrations marking the operation continue to be a point of friction between [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] and neighbouring [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict

[[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] became one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. By the late 1980s, the federation was under strain, and as [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] began to seek a looser relationship or even independence within Yugoslavia, ethnic Serbs in the country, who constituted about 12 percent of the population, started to consider their own position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. These Serbs were primarily located in Slavonia, Western Slavonia, and Krajina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

In July 1990, [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] adopted a new constitution, which Croatian Serbs believed downgraded their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Consequently, they established self-administered areas, with the "Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina" formed in December 1990, followed by autonomous regions in Slavonia and Western Slavonia the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Fighting erupted when Croatian forces attempted to reassert control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

On June 25, 1991, [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Croatian Serb forces, supported by the now Serbian-controlled Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), took control of roughly a third of [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]]'s territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Over 200,000 Croats and non-Serbs were forcibly expelled from these areas, a policy later termed ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. In October 1991, [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] formally broke away from Yugoslavia and launched a counter-offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In response to these gains, the Croatian Serbs unilaterally declared independence on December 19, 1991, forming the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

A ceasefire was agreed upon in early 1992, leading to the establishment of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) around the Serb-controlled zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Despite this, fighting continued in [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. A significant turning point occurred in March 1994, when the United States brokered a peace agreement between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims, allowing [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] to focus more fully on the Serbian secession on its own soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Operation Storm and Its Aftermath

In early 1995, [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] announced it would no longer allow UNPROFOR to operate on its territory, signalling an intent to retake the territory by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The first step was "Operation Flash" in May 1995, where Croatian troops attacked Western Slavonia, forcing the vast majority of its 14,000 Serbian inhabitants to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

On August 4, [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] began with a massive artillery bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Serbian resistance quickly crumbled, and between 200,000 and 250,000 people, mostly the territory's inhabitants, fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Within 72 hours, [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] was over, with Krajina under Croatian control and the Serbian secession defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The war officially ended on November 12, 1995, with an agreement to reintegrate Slavonia into [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Divergent Narratives and Annual Friction

The legacy of [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] continues to create significant friction between [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] and [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

*   **Croatian Perspective**: [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] celebrates [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] as 'Victory Day', marking the final triumph in its "homeland war for national independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. They view it as a legitimate military action to retake secessionist territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Serbian Perspective**: [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] regards [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] as a moment of "national mourning," highlighting the forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs from their ancestral homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] sees Victory Day as a provocative celebration of what is now widely accepted to have been an act of ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Legal Battles and International Scrutiny

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was set up to prosecute war crimes and human rights abuses during the Yugoslav conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. ICTY indicted Serbian figures, including Slobodan Milosevic, for crimes against humanity in [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

However, prosecuting Croatians for actions during [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] proved more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. A 1996 Human Rights Watch report catalogued atrocities during and after the operation, including attacks on fleeing civilians and torture/murder of Serbs who remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. ICTY indictments accused [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]]'s leadership of a "joint criminal enterprise" to permanently remove the Serbian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] firmly rejected these claims, arguing the operation was justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

General Ante Gotovina, a key Croatian commander, was arrested in 2005 and transferred to the ICTY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. He was found guilty of war crimes in 2011 and sentenced to 24 years, but was acquitted on appeal in 2012, leading to a hero's welcome upon his return to [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

In July 1999, [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] launched a case against [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] filed a counter-claim, accusing [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] of genocide during [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. In 2008 and 2015, the ICJ ruled that while both sides committed acts that *could* constitute genocide, there was no definitive proof of intent to destroy populations, but rather to force them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Therefore, neither was found to have contravened the genocide convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Ongoing Tensions and Path to Reconciliation

The differing interpretations of [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] continue to fuel tension between [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] and [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]]. While [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] acknowledges the ethnic cleansing that took place earlier in Serb-held areas, it focuses on the ethnic cleansing during [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Conversely, [[croatia_and_the_republic_of_serbian_krajina_conflict | Croatia]] tends to overlook the humanitarian costs of the offensive, which forced two-thirds of the country's ethnic Serbs from their ancestral lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Instead of remaining an annual source of tension, the events surrounding [[operation_storm_and_its_legality | Operation Storm]] could become a source of reconciliation if both nations reflect on the heavy cost of the entire conflict, affecting hundreds of thousands of people on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

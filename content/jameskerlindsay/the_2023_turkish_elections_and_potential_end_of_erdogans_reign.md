On May 14, 2023, Turkey is set to hold what many consider one of the most critical elections in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For two decades, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has dominated Turkish politics, profoundly transforming the country and its global standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, his rule has become increasingly authoritarian, leading Turkey in a troubling direction both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The upcoming elections raise the question of whether his reign might finally conclude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Erdogan's]] Ascent and Early Governance

[[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], born in Istanbul on February 26, 1954, became engaged in politics as a student, joining a religious party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He steadily rose through the ranks, becoming the mayor of Istanbul in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. His religious beliefs led to a four-month jail sentence in 1998 for reciting a poem deemed a call to religious violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. After his release, he continued his political career, leading the new Justice and Development Party (AKP), founded in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

In November 2002, following an economic and constitutional crisis, the AKP achieved an overwhelming victory in the general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Despite a previous conviction preventing him from standing for Parliament, the new government quickly overturned the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] was elected as an MP and became prime minister on March 14, 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Initially, many were suspicious of his motives, fearing a religious agenda that would cut Turkey off from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. However, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] surprised skeptics by prioritizing European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This led to improved relations with Greece and efforts to resolve the division of Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, culminating in Turkey formally opening talks to join the EU in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The pursuit of EU accession drove significant changes, including liberalizing society, easing restrictions on religion in public life (like allowing headscarves in government offices), and introducing new minority rights, including Kurdish language education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] also reined in the military's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_controversies_during_erdogans_governance | Challenges]] and Growing Authoritarianism

Despite initial reforms, concerns about [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] began to grow. While the AKP won another overwhelming victory in 2007, the 2011 elections were tainted by allegations of electoral fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The turning point came in May 2013, when efforts to disperse protesters in Istanbul escalated into widespread, violent demonstrations across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. After putting down the unrest, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] clamped down on opposition, becoming increasingly autocratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

In 2014, no longer content as prime minister, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] ran for and won the presidency, appointing a compliant prime minister to do his bidding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. His control appeared complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### The 2016 Coup Attempt and Consolidation of Power
On July 15, 2016, a military coup attempt occurred but quickly collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. In response, the government launched a massive crackdown, jailing thousands and purging suspected opponents from civil service, military, judiciary, and higher education positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This event allowed [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] to consolidate his power further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

In 2017, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]] introduced constitutional changes, later approved by a nationwide referendum, that abolished the prime minister's post and created an executive presidency similar to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Current State of Turkey Under [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | Erdogan]]

Domestically, Turkey is now described as a profoundly illiberal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The media is heavily controlled, human rights abuses are rife, and there are serious concerns about the democratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The economy is in disarray, and allegations of high-level corruption persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan's]] increasingly autocratic rule has been marked by what is described as a growing megalomania, evidenced by the construction of a massive presidential palace in Ankara, legislation making insulting the president a criminal offense, and the decision to rename the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

In foreign policy, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] has moved Turkey further from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. His authoritarianism has effectively ended hopes for Turkish EU membership, with talks halted for the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Concerns about Turkey's reliability as a NATO ally have also emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. While attempting to establish Turkey as an international actor by building ties across the Balkans, Africa, and Central Asia, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] has also formed a complex relationship with Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This includes purchasing Russian-made anti-aircraft missile systems, much to the annoyance of the United States, and maintaining an ambivalent stance on Ukraine, continuing trade with Russia despite NATO partners imposing sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

This overall picture is one of a Turkey led by an authoritarian leader increasingly cut off from Turkish society and its traditional partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## The 2023 Elections

Against this backdrop, Turkey will hold presidential and parliamentary elections on May 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. After 20 years, many see this as the best opportunity to unseat [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] and reverse the constitutional reforms that centralized power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

While [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] has experienced a slump in his poll ratings, partly due to the devastating earthquake in early 2023 that killed tens of thousands amid claims of government failure, the election still appears to be tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Six opposition parties have formed a coalition to unseat him, but the coalition appears divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Furthermore, several other candidates have refused to join the opposition group, potentially splitting the vote and allowing [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] to remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan's]] Complex Legacy

The [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] era presents a complex legacy. It is important to recall the political chaos that engulfed Turkey before his leadership, a period few under 30 in the country would remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Before [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]], Turkey was an illiberal democracy marred by infighting and heavy restrictions on human and minority rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

For roughly his first decade in power, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] did move Turkey in a broadly positive direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. He attempted to solve the Cyprus issue, introduced significant domestic political and social reforms, and opened talks with the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

However, his subsequent actions over his second decade in power cannot be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Turkey has moved in a genuinely worrying direction, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. There have even been calls for Turkey to be removed from NATO, and few in the West now regard it as a reliable and trustworthy ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Regardless of the problems of the pre-[[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] past or the uncertainty of a post-[[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] future, one certainty remains: [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has utterly transformed Turkey, initially for the better, but more recently for the worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

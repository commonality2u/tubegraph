In 2011, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's long-time leader, was captured and executed by rebel forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This event, however, did not lead to a new era of stability, as Libya soon collapsed into civil war, causing widespread suffering and becoming a significant source of instability in North Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These consequences have led to claims that eliminating Gaddafi was, in fact, a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## International Debate on Overthrowing Leaders
The question of whether foreign leaders should be overthrown is a controversial issue in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. International law generally prohibits intervention, respecting states as sovereign entities, even if their leaders are undesirable or dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

However, there's a counter-argument that the international community has a responsibility to uphold human rights, protect populations from dictators' abuses, and respond to leaders who threaten international peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Despite these arguments, efforts to remove such leaders can have dramatic and unforeseen consequences, often leading to a political vacuum that is disastrous for the country and broader regional and international insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya is a prominent example of this, as it plunged the country into a deep civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_libyas_political_and_economic_landscape | Historical Context of Libya]]
Libya, located in North Africa, is the 16th largest country globally and the fourth largest in Africa, covering 1.75 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It borders Egypt and Sudan to the east, Chad and Niger to the south, Algeria and Tunisia to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Its population, currently around 6.7 million, is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast, primarily in Tripoli (the capital) and Benghazi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Libya is rich in resources, ranking in the top 10 worldwide for oil and natural gas deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This wealth made it one of the wealthiest states in North Africa at one point, with a per capita GDP of almost $16,000 in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, this figure has since halved, falling below the regional average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Libya has a long and varied history, having been conquered by the Phoenicians, Carthage, and the Greeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The north coast came under Roman control in 74 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. After the Roman Empire split, it was divided between Western and Eastern parts until the 7th century when it was conquered by Arab forces following the emergence of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It remained under Muslim rule, becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

In 1911, Italy seized control until 1943, when Allied forces occupied it after heavy fighting in World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Although France and Italy relinquished their claims in 1947, Britain retained control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Following UN calls for self-determination, Libya gained independence on December 24, 1951, becoming the United Kingdom of Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Initially, the new country was poor, underdeveloped, and fragmented, heavily dependent on foreign aid from countries like Britain and the United States, who received military bases in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This changed dramatically with the discovery of oil in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Muammar Gaddafi's Rise to Power
The oil discovery led to growing disaffection among Libyan youth, many of whom supported Gamal Abdul Nasser's Arab nationalism in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This culminated on September 1, 1969, when a group of young army officers led by Muammar Al Gaddafi staged a coup, overthrowing the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Gaddafi, a devout Muslim and Arab nationalist, immediately began transforming Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. As commander of the Armed Forces and chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, he promoted a highly devolved form of populist socialism combined with strict adherence to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Internally, he remade the country, and he also radically transformed its foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He moved against Western influences by closing US and British bases, expelling Jewish and Italian communities, and nationalizing the oil industry in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## State Sponsorship of Terrorism
Gaddafi adopted an uncompromising stance towards Israel, denouncing the 1978 US-brokered peace agreement with Egypt and welcoming the assassination of Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This escalated in the 1980s as he openly supported various Arab militant groups and other terrorist organizations worldwide, including the Red Army, the IRA, and Islamist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

In 1986, following several attacks by Libyan agents on Western targets, the United States launched a bombing attack on Gaddafi's compound in Tripoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. In revenge, Gaddafi's regime bombed a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Shift in Foreign Policy
The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, on which Gaddafi had relied for patronage, changed his fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. His regime came under UN sanctions after US and British prosecutors indicted two Libyan agents for the Lockerbie bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. By the end of the 1990s, with sanctions biting, Libya began a significant foreign policy shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Gaddafi agreed to hand over the Lockerbie bombing suspects and pay compensation for the death of a British policewoman killed outside the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984, leading to his reintegration into the international fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The fall of Saddam Hussein following the US invasion of Iraq further influenced Gaddafi, who, believing he could be next, pledged to abandon his efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This led to a rebuilding of relations with the US and the European Union, and Libya gained a seat on the UN Security Council and chaired the African Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Overthrow of Gaddafi
Despite this progress, the outbreak of the [[impact_of_the_arab_spring_on_libya | Arab Spring]] in December 2010 changed everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. As protests spread across the region, bringing down leaders in neighboring Egypt and sparking an uprising in [[syrias_political_instability_and_coups | Syria]], demonstrations erupted in Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. A brutal crackdown by security forces fueled public anger and led to high-profile defections, but Gaddafi vowed to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Opposition to his regime snowballed, with various groups forming the Transitional National Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. As violence escalated, the United Nations imposed sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Although the opposition secured the country's east and seemed poised to take the capital, Gaddafi's forces regained momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. At this stage, Britain and France called for direct [[international_intervention_and_its_consequences_in_libya | intervention]], proposing a no-fly zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Despite initial caution from other Western states like Germany and the US, the Arab League supported the measure, leading the UN Security Council to vote in favor of military measures to halt the fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

By the end of March 2011, NATO began missile and airstrikes against forces loyal to Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Britain, France, and Italy also sent military advisers to assist the rebels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. In August, opposition forces broke through and took Tripoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The Transitional National Council was internationally recognized as the lawful government, and Gaddafi, who had fled the capital, was captured and killed by rebel forces on October 20, 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## [[civil_conflict_and_instability_in_libya_post2011 | Post-Gaddafi Civil Conflict and Instability]]
Despite hopes for a fresh start, the disparate groups that overthrew Gaddafi soon turned on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. In 2014, this erupted into the Second Libyan Civil War, with the Government of National Accord (GNA) in the west clashing with the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Various outside actors complicated the situation; the UN and most Western states recognized the Turkish-backed GNA, while countries like Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates supported the LNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The country also became a magnet for Islamist organizations, including ISIS, tragically highlighted by the murder of the US ambassador in September 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

In October 2020, nine years of war formally ended with a permanent ceasefire, intended to pave the way for presidential elections that have yet to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Though the fighting has ceased, the situation remains precarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Impact on Libya
The conflict has taken a massive toll on Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Once considered one of Africa's wealthiest countries with considerable social welfare programs, it has been decimated politically, socially, and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Tens of thousands have been killed, and millions displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Observers question how Western states shifted so quickly from accepting Gaddafi to fully endorsing regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This has been a source of international criticism and debate within Western policy circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. In 2016, Barack Obama cited the failure to plan for Gaddafi's overthrow as the most significant foreign policy failure of his presidency, though he stood by the decision to oust him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Others argue that Gaddafi's overthrow was nothing short of a disaster for Libya and international security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The ousting of Gaddafi, similar to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, raises crucial questions about the conduct of international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. While he was undoubtedly a despotic leader and Libya a persistent state sponsor of terrorism, he had also begun efforts at rapprochement and was being reintegrated into international society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Libya's experience prompts both pro- and anti-interventionists to carefully consider how to respond to unstable autocrats and the broader effects of their removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

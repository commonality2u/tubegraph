Historically, serving and former political leaders often enjoyed immunity from prosecution, even for severe crimes committed while in office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Emergence of International Justice

This trend began to change in the late 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Tribunals were established for Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Yugoslavia, marking a shift in how international law addressed accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Following these, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was created to prosecute the most serious human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Such crimes include genocide and crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Challenges to Enforcement

Despite the ICC's establishment as a mechanism for justice against previously untouchable leaders, its enforcement remains uneven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Various factors, including domestic political considerations, can influence the course of international prosecutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Case Study: Rodrigo Duterte

The case of Rodrigo Duterte, former president of the Philippines, exemplifies the complexities of international prosecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Duterte was investigated for overseeing a policy of state-sanctioned killing during his term from 2016 to 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He initially received official protection from his successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### The Philippines and the ICC

The Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Despite this withdrawal, the ICC opened an investigation into Duterte's "war on drugs" in May 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The ICC rejected arguments that it lacked jurisdiction, stating that the alleged crimes occurred when the Philippines was still a member of the Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Duterte's Extradition

In March 2025, Duterte was arrested and extradited to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This occurred after an unraveling of the political alliance between Duterte and his successor, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. An ICC secret arrest warrant was issued on March 7, charging him with murder, torture, and rape committed between November 2011 and March 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Four days later, he was detained at Manila Airport upon returning from Hong Kong and transferred to The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Marcos Jr. asserted that the extradition was a matter of the Philippines meeting its international obligations, specifically to Interpol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. If the charges are confirmed and the case proceeds to trial, Duterte would become the first former Asian leader to stand trial at the ICC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Repercussions in the Philippines

Duterte's arrest and extradition have caused deep polarization within Philippine society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. While some welcome it as a step toward justice, his supporters view it as an affront to national sovereignty and a betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This has led to mass protests in his home city of Davao and in Manila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The legitimacy of the charges is questioned online, and victims, their families, and human rights activists have faced intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

Despite the domestic controversy, to many outside observers, the decision to [[reasons_for_dutertes_extradition_to_the_icc | arrest and extradite Duterte]] is seen as a crucial step towards strengthening international justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

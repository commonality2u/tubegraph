The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a persistent source of instability in the Middle East and beyond since the 1940s, highlights critical aspects of [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]] and conflict resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Often, once the immediate fighting subsides, conflicts fade from public attention, remaining unresolved and susceptible to re-eruption with "disastrous consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### The Challenge of Lingering Disputes

While the issue once dominated [[impact_on_international_relations | international headlines]], it had "seemingly fallen off the global agenda in recent years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This complacency ended on October 7, 2023, with a massive attack by Hamas militants against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, prompting Israel to declare war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This event brought into sharp focus the "political, diplomatic, military, and strategic consequences of a return to full-scale armed conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Historical Context and Failed Resolutions

The conflict has a "long, complex and highly contested history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

*   **UN Partition Plan (1947)**: Following World War II, the newly created United Nations voted to partition British-controlled Palestine into two states: one Jewish and one Arab Palestinian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This plan was immediately rejected by Palestinians and neighboring Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, leading to the 1948 war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **1967 War**: After Israel's overwhelming victory in 1967, it captured the West Bank and Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The [[role_of_international_community_in_the_conflict_resolution | international community]], through a UN Security Council resolution, called on Israel to withdraw from these occupied territories, while "reaffirming Israel's right to exist within its previously accepted boundaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Breakthroughs**: A significant shift occurred in 1978 when Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Over subsequent decades, the Palestinian leadership "gradually accepted that any Palestinian state would have to be based on the 1967 borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

#### Oslo Accords (1993)

A major "breakthrough agreement" was reached in 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. In exchange for acknowledging Israel's existence, a Palestinian Authority was to be established in the West Bank and Gaza as a "prelude to an independent Palestinian state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, little progress was made towards a two-state solution in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, and the situation deteriorated by the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Current Challenges to Resolution

The recent attack by Hamas, a group committed to "the destruction of Israel and Palestinian control over the entire historic territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, has further complicated prospects for resolution. Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007, leading to an Israeli blockade and tight Egyptian border controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

#### The Need for a "Political Horizon"

Many believe that the "only way for Israel to win this war decisively is to reach a final comprehensive settlement with the Palestinians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The conflict "must now be resolved, rather than managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The UN had highlighted weeks before the October 2023 attack that a "political horizon" for a settlement must be re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

However, significant obstacles remain:
*   **Viable Palestinian State**: Beyond simply gaining UN membership, a Palestinian state needs to be "viable economically and politically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This requires territorial agreements, "enormous external aid and investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, and security support to counter groups like Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **International Effort**: Achieving a lasting peace requires a "monumental effort by the wider [[role_of_international_community_in_the_conflict_resolution | international community]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. The question remains whether the recent horrific events can finally "galvanize the world to act" or if "global attention will again wane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

International attention has recently focused on the [[ethiopiaegypt_water_dispute | dispute]] surrounding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), as it has steadily risen in prominence despite previous focus on the civil war in Ethiopia's Tigray province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This massive dam on the Nile River, nearing completion, has led to severe tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt, with both countries remaining at loggerheads over the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The situation raises concerns about the possibility of Africa's next resource conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Natural Resources and Conflict
Natural resources are a significant source of tension and conflict in modern international relations, with disputes often arising over access to energy resources, precious metals, and minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Fresh water is another critical resource, vital for drinking, sanitation, agriculture, and energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. As climate change increasingly affects water supplies, it is expected to become an even greater source of instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The GERD [[ethiopiaegypt_water_dispute | dispute]] represents one of the world's most crucial water access disputes in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Ethiopia and Egypt: A Comparison
[[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] and Egypt are located in the northeast corner of Africa, separated by Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. They are similar in size and population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:
*   **[[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]]**: 1.1 million square kilometers (426,000 square miles), 26th largest UN member. With approximately 120 million inhabitants, it is the second most populous country in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Egypt**: Around 1 million square kilometers (390,000 square miles), 29th largest UN member. With 110 million inhabitants, it is the third most populous African state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Economically, the countries differ considerably; in 2021, Egypt's per capita GDP was US$3,700 compared to US$925 in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Historical Relationship and the Nile
Egypt and [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] are among Africa's oldest countries, with diplomatic relations established in 1927, making them the first independent African countries to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They were also two of the four founding African members of the United Nations in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Despite this shared [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | history]], their relationship has often been strained, influenced by issues like [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]]'s recognition of Israel in 1961 and their differing alignments during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The most significant issue shaping their relationship has been the management of the Nile River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. At approximately 6,700 kilometers (4,000 miles), the Nile is Africa's longest river, composed of two main tributaries:
*   **White Nile**: Originates in the Great Lakes region (Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Blue Nile**: Starts in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] and joins the White Nile in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

For Egypt, the Nile is a crucial resource, providing nearly 98% of its drinking water and virtually all water for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Egypt is extremely sensitive to any disruption of the river's flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

[[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] also views the Nile as an essential resource, with significant water needs for its farming population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. As one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] faces massive growth in energy demand, with almost half its population lacking electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The Ethiopian government has long sought to harness the Blue Nile for hydroelectric power, leading to the current tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The Genesis of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam
Egypt has been concerned about [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] building a dam since the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Successive Ethiopian governments had plans for a dam but often held off due to fears of Egyptian reprisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In the 1970s, Egypt threatened war if such a project proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This stance continued into the New Millennium, with former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak reportedly suggesting bombing any new dam on the Nile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The situation changed in 2011 with the Arab Spring and Mubarak's removal from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Seizing the opportunity, [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] decided to proceed with the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### GERD's Scale and Ambition
The GERD project is a massive undertaking, estimated to cost over US$4.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>:
*   **Location**: Less than 30 kilometers from the border with Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Height**: Almost 150 meters high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Reservoir**: Expected to contain 74 billion cubic meters of water and cover 1,900 square kilometers (720 square miles) when filled after 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Significance**: It will be the largest hydropower project in Africa and one of the largest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The dam symbolizes [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]]'s growing ambitions and its strategy to lift tens of millions of its citizens out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Evolving Tensions and Diplomatic Failures
The start of the GERD project led to severe tensions with Sudan and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While Sudan initially opposed the project, it later shifted its position, seeing potential for extra electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Egypt, however, took a much stronger position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. While not objecting to [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]]'s development goals, Cairo insisted that the project must consider the legitimate interests of affected countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Failed Agreements
*   **2015 Declaration of Principles**: An agreement was signed, widely hailed as a significant step, but little came from it, and tensions steadily grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **2016 Accusations**: [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] accused Egypt of supporting separatist groups, including the [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | Oromo Liberation Front]], a claim Egypt denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **2018 Amicable Meeting**: Ethiopian Prime Minister Abi Ahmed Ali met Egyptian leader Abdul Fatah El Sisi in Cairo, expressing willingness to agree on the dam, with Abi Ahmed insisting [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] would "never hurt the people of Egypt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Hopes were short-lived, and tensions resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **2019 Threat of War**: By late 2019, relations had completely broken down, with Abi Ahmed threatening war if Egypt acted against the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **2020 African Union Mediation**: In July 2020, African Union mediation led to a "major common understanding," but key elements remained unresolved, including water release during drought and dispute resolution (with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] reportedly rejecting binding arbitration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Current State and International Concern
Since 2020, little progress has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Sudan has renewed concerns, and Egypt has adopted a tougher stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

> [00:09:47] "more than a hundred million Egyptians face an existential threat from a dam of Mammoth proportions being built along the artery that gives them life."
> — Egyptian Foreign Minister (2021)

The international community has also expressed concern:
*   **UN Security Council**: Discussed the matter in 2020 and 2021, issuing a presidential statement calling for resumed negotiations under African Union auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Dam Filling**: With construction complete, [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] began filling the dam, which Egypt condemned in a letter to the Security Council in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Obstruction of Talks**: Egypt has accused [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] of consistently obstructing talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **African Union Summit**: Cairo pushed for the issue to be on the agenda of the African Union Summit in February 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

Egypt repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot tolerate such a fundamental challenge to its interests, arguing that without an agreement, the project threatens international peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | Potential Consequences]] and Solutions
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is widely viewed as one of Africa's most serious [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | potential flash points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While full-scale war might seem unlikely, the dam's continued filling and its anticipated full operation in 2024 could still spark a conflict between two of Africa's largest and most influential countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Despite the growing tensions, a study based on computer modeling suggests an optimal outcome exists that considers the wishes and concerns of [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]], Egypt, and Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. However, there is currently little indication that the countries are willing to discuss this solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

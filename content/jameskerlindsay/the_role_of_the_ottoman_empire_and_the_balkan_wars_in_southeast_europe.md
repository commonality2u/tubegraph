The story of the ongoing dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia over history and language largely begins with the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39">[02:39]</a>. Having previously controlled most of Southeast Europe, the Ottoman Empire was in a state of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>. This decline set the stage for significant territorial shifts and the emergence of new nation-states, leading to complex [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | identity issues]] and conflicts.

## The Treaty of Berlin and Bulgarian Claims

In 1878, the Treaty of Berlin established the Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>. From its inception, the nascent Bulgarian state asserted claims to several neighboring areas still under direct Ottoman rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59">[02:59]</a>. These claims included Thrace, to its immediate south, and Macedonia, to its west and southwest, which Bulgaria viewed as part of its national territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>.

A nationalist movement, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO), emerged in the 1890s, dedicated to the liberation of the Macedonian region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14">[03:14]</a>. However, Macedonia was also claimed by neighboring [[historical_tensions_between_greece_and_turkey | Greece]] and [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Serbia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>.

## The Balkan Wars and World Wars

### First Balkan War (1912)

In 1912, Bulgaria, having gained full independence, allied with [[historical_tensions_between_greece_and_turkey | Greece]], [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Serbia]], and Montenegro to expel the Ottoman Empire from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29">[03:29]</a>. While Bulgaria successfully captured Thrace, securing vital strategic access to the Mediterranean, it only acquired a small portion of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38">[03:38]</a>. The majority of Macedonia was instead captured by Greek and Serb forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>.

### World War I

Undeterred by its limited gains in Macedonia, Bulgaria sided with Germany during the First World War and managed to capture the Serbian-held part of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>. However, Bulgarian control of this region was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>. In September 1918, [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Serbia]] retook the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>. Subsequently, as part of [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Serbia]], the area became a constituent part of the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06">[04:06]</a>.

### World War II

Despite these territorial losses, Bulgaria continued to harbor claims to the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14">[04:14]</a>. During the Second World War, Bulgaria allied with Nazi Germany and again occupied most of Serbian Macedonia, along with parts of Greek Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>. Yet again, its control was brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>. As the war concluded, Bulgaria switched sides and was compelled to relinquish the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>.

## Post-War Developments and the Emergence of Macedonian Identity

The Second World War marked a pivotal turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[04:34]</a>. Instead of being reintegrated into [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Serbia]], the northern part of Macedonia gained autonomy, becoming the Socialist Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>. It subsequently became one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a>.

In the ensuing years, a deliberate effort was made to foster a distinct [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Macedonian identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55">[04:55]</a>. This process emphasized a unique relationship, history, language, and culture, distinct from neighboring Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>. By the 1970s, Macedonian, though mutually intelligible with Bulgarian, was officially registered as a separate language by the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10">[05:10]</a>. This sense of nationhood became prominent as Yugoslavia disintegrated in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>.

Once close allies, [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | relations between Turkey and Israel]] have steadily deteriorated over the past two decades, with matters now approaching a boiling point, particularly concerning Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. There is a real threat of confrontation between Israeli and Turkish forces against the backdrop of growing tensions in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Historical Context of [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey-Israel Relations]]
[[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Israel and Turkey]] were once close strategic partners with strong defense and intelligence cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Turkey became the first Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel on March 28, 1949, establishing diplomatic relations shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This decision was partly based on a shared geostrategic outlook, with both countries aligned with the Western camp during the Cold War, and a similar ideological worldview founded on secular nationalist traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The "golden age" of [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkish-Israel relations]] occurred in the 1990s, marked by strengthened diplomatic ties, a free trade agreement, and significant military and security engagement, including defense industry cooperation and training agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Deterioration and Attempted Thaws
The critical shift began in November 2002, with the rise of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Although the AKP initially maintained closeness to the West, [[turkeys_foreign_relations_with_russia_and_the_west | Turkish foreign policy]] began to pivot, focusing more on the Arab Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Key moments of deterioration include:
*   **Growing Criticism of Israeli Policies** The Turkish government became increasingly critical of Israeli policies toward Palestinians, highlighted by a heated exchange between Erdoğan and Israeli President Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Mavi Marmara Incident (2010)**: In May 2010, Israeli commandos raided a convoy of Turkish ships attempting to deliver aid to Gaza, resulting in nine deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Turkey subsequently withdrew its ambassador to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Failed Reconciliation Attempts**: Despite an Israeli apology and compensation in 2013-2016, and renewed efforts to rebuild relations in January 2022, including direct phone calls between foreign ministers and an Israeli presidential visit to Ankara, these thaws were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Hamas Attack (October 2023)**: The latest deterioration was spurred by Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Erdoğan became an outspoken critic of the Israeli offensive, accusing Israeli leaders of war crimes and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. By November 2024, Turkey severed diplomatic ties with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## [[turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey's Role in Syria]]
A critical development in the deteriorating relationship is [[turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey's expanding role in Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. After the overthrow of the Assad regime by the Islamist HTS militia and its Turkish-backed allies, Turkey has emerged as a key international actor in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

Turkey maintains a military presence in northern Syria due to concerns about a de facto autonomous Syrian Kurdish region, which Ankara views as a threat to peace and security in adjoining Kurdish areas of southeast Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Israel's Concerns and Actions
Israel views [[turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey's expanding role in Syria]] as a substantial security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   On April 2, Israel carried out airstrikes against several Syrian military installations, including two air bases reportedly being considered as potential bases for Turkish forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Israel explicitly stated that these attacks were directed at Turkey, accusing Ankara of playing a negative role in Syria and attempting to make the country a Turkish protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   The Israeli defense minister warned the new government in Damascus of heavy consequences if it allowed hostile forces to be stationed in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## [[potential_conflict_and_escalation_between_turkey_and_israel | Potential for Conflict]]
Given their poor recent [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | relations]] and Israel's clear stance on Turkish encroachment in Syria, the two countries appear to be on a dangerous collision course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

However, any confrontation is likely to be limited to Syria, as neither state would want to escalate it into a conflict on their national territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While direct armed confrontations between Turkish and Israeli forces in Syria are possible, both countries may also focus on using local proxies and cyberattacks to fight more indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## De-escalation Efforts
Despite tensions, both countries have taken steps to avoid unwanted escalation. News reports indicate that Azerbaijan hosted talks between Turkish and Israeli officials to establish a deconfliction mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Although the Turkish foreign minister described these as "technical talks" limited to operational coordination, they are seen as a welcome sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Broader Implications
Even if fighting remains limited to Syria, the broader international implications of any conflict could be enormous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   Such a confrontation, especially if fought with local proxies, could plunge Syria back into chaos and draw in other regional actors, potentially reigniting the civil war into an even more deadly phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   Given that both Israel and Turkey are significant regional military powers, the potential for a disastrous escalation is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   Concerns also exist regarding the United States' capability to manage such a crisis, as it would typically be expected to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

These growing tensions between former close allies are now viewed with deep concern internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

Ireland has historically maintained a firm policy of neutrality, deliberately avoiding membership in [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, recent geopolitical shifts suggest this stance is being re-evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | country's strong support for Ukraine]] following Russia's invasion, coupled with increased Russian naval activity near its coast, highlights a changing political, security, and strategic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This has led to an intense debate on whether Ireland should reassess its position on joining [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | Ireland's Historical Stance on Neutrality]]

For much of its history, Ireland has upheld an official policy of military neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This policy has become deeply intertwined with the national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Origins of Neutrality
After gaining self-rule from Britain, the Irish Free State sought to distance itself from British foreign entanglements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Its constitution guaranteed it could not join wars without parliamentary approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This commitment to cooperation and peaceful dispute settlement was reiterated when Ireland became a republic in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The formal principle of neutrality was proclaimed at the outset of the Second World War when Ireland refused to join the Allied effort against Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. While controversial, Ireland was inclined towards the Allies, sharing intelligence and allowing approximately 50,000 Irish citizens to join British armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Post-War Refusal to Join NATO
Following the Second World War and the onset of the Cold War, Ireland was invited by the United States to join the newly formed North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. However, the Irish government refused, deeming a military alliance with the United Kingdom, which still occupied a part of its claimed territory, unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Thus, Ireland's neutrality stemmed more from political realities than ideological conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Notably, neutrality has never been formally enshrined in the Irish Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## [[irelands_participation_in_international_security_and_peacekeeping | Ireland's Role in International Security and Peacekeeping]]
Despite remaining outside Western alliances, Ireland cultivated a significant international reputation, particularly as a contributor to UN peacekeeping missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Over 60 years, Irish Defence Forces have served in various international hotspots, including the Congo, Cyprus, and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The context of Irish neutrality began to change by the 1990s. Relations with the UK improved significantly, especially after Ireland joined the European Communities (now the EU) in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> and the landmark 1998 Good Friday Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The end of the Cold War also played a role, with Ireland joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. However, neutrality remained deeply embedded in Irish thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, as evidenced by Ireland's insistence on a protocol in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty reaffirming its traditional military neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | Impact of the Ukraine War on Ireland's Foreign Policy]]
The war in Ukraine has profoundly challenged Ireland's long-held neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Shifting Stance
Ireland has unequivocally supported Ukraine, emphasizing that military neutrality does not equate to political neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Dublin has condemned Russia's invasion, supported EU sanctions, and backed Russia's expulsion from the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Beyond this, Ireland has provided 55 million euros in non-lethal military aid to Ukraine as part of a wider EU effort and agreed to train Ukrainian forces in another EU member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Many argue this pushes the boundaries of military neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Emerging Strategic Concerns
Growing Russian naval activity around Irish waters has highlighted Ireland's increasing strategic significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Vital undersea communication cables connecting Ireland to North America are a concern, with fears of potential Russian attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Irish government is reportedly considering joining a NATO project to protect this critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

These developments have prompted calls for Ireland to formally abandon neutrality and join [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The government has signaled its openness by rejecting a proposal to codify neutrality into the constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> and initiating a public consultation on the country's defence orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | Arguments For and Against Changing Stance]]
The debate over Ireland's neutrality is complex, with [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | various reasons for and against]] a shift in policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Arguments for Retaining Neutrality
*   **Identity and Role**: Neutrality is seen as a fundamental part of Irish identity and defines its role on the world stage, particularly as a UN peacekeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Abandoning it, some argue, would diminish this standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Pragmatism**: Opponents of NATO membership argue there is no external pressure to change, and Ireland is effectively protected by NATO anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. They note that countries like Austria maintain neutrality despite others like Finland and Sweden abandoning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Ireland has one of the lowest defence expenditures in the EU, at 0.3% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Joining NATO would require a significant increase to the expected 2% of GDP on defence, which many view as an unacceptable diversion of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Northern Ireland**: Despite progress, some feel it is inconceivable for Ireland to formally ally with the UK, which historically occupied Irish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Arguments for Joining NATO
*   **Mediator Role**: Proponents argue that a country can be a successful mediator even as a NATO member, citing Norway as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **"Freeloading"**: Critics contend that Ireland currently "freeloads" on a broader [[European Union and NATO aspirations versus proRussian sentiment | European defence umbrella]] without contributing adequately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. They also point out that increased defence spending is likely necessary regardless of neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, with the government already announcing the largest defence spending increase in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Undermined Northern Ireland Argument**: A recent revelation of a secret 1950s agreement, suggesting Britain has provided Ireland with air security for 70 years, has challenged the argument linking neutrality to the UK's historical presence in Northern Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This report is neither confirmed nor denied by the Irish government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Defence**: Given that Ireland would be guaranteed defence from Britain, the European Union, and the United States in the event of an attack, many argue it is time for the country to accept this reality and join [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The outcome of the debate is uncertain, with mixed and even contradictory polling data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. An April 2022 poll showed 70% support for sanctions against Russia but two-thirds wishing to maintain neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Another poll indicated a more even split, with 52% favoring joining [[NATO and Eastern Europe security | NATO]] versus 48% against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. A referendum on the issue, which would almost certainly be required, could go either way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Even if full NATO membership is deemed too far, other options include closer cooperation with the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> or abandoning formal neutrality to integrate more deeply into [[European Union and NATO aspirations versus proRussian sentiment | European Union defence structures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Regardless of the final decision, these discussions in Ireland highlight how the Ukraine war has profoundly impacted [[impact_on_european_security_and_nato | European and International Security debates]], forcing countries to re-evaluate their long-held views on their place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

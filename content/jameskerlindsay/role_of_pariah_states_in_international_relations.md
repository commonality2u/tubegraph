Pariah states, sometimes referred to as rogue states, are a notable characteristic of [[impact_on_international_relations | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These states operate outside the conventional international order by attempting to subvert the rules of the global system or systematically undermine other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

A state can become a pariah for various reasons:
*   Exporting a revolutionary ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Launching wars of aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Committing genocide or gross human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Being captured by organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

## Syria: A Modern Example of a Pariah State

Syria stands out as a prominent example of a pariah state in the contemporary international system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Historical Context of Syria's Pariah Status

For over half a century, Syria has been perceived as a repressive dictatorship and a destabilizing force in the broader Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. From the outset, the Syrian state faced significant internal problems and suffered a major defeat in 1948 during the unsuccessful Arab attempt to dismantle Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This led to frequent military coups, the first occurring in March 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

In November 1970, Hafez al-Assad seized power through a coup, becoming president the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He established a harsh and repressive regime, eliminating all opposition and concentrating political power and state security in the hands of the Alawite minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Externally, he aimed to establish Syria as a leading actor in the Arab world, aligning with the Soviet Union, adopting an anti-American stance, and maintaining an uncompromising position on Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Syria's actions that contributed to its pariah status under Hafez al-Assad included:
*   Supporting militant Palestinian groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Becoming the first country designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department, a status it still holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   Sending troops into Lebanon during its Civil War, eventually becoming an occupying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Building close ties with revolutionary Iran, facilitating Tehran's efforts to undermine Israel and assist militant groups like Hezbollah and Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

These actions led to Syria being regarded as one of the most repressive, dangerous, and destabilizing states in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Syria under Bashar al-Assad

Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father in June 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Despite initial hopes for reform, he maintained strict control over domestic politics and continued the country's hardline foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This included opposing Israel's existence and facilitating the travel of militant Islamic fighters to Iraq after the 2003 US invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The Arab Spring in 2011 led to protests in Syria, which the Assad regime met with a brutal crackdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This resulted in widespread international condemnation from the United States and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In November 2011, the Arab League suspended Syria and imposed economic and political sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. By 2012, the uprising escalated into a full-scale civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

During the civil war, while Iran supported Damascus, an international coalition formed against Assad, with military support from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The United States and other key [[role_of_western_countries_in_rule_erosion | Western States]] recognized the opposition as the legitimate voice of the Syrian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. However, the emergence of Islamist groups like Al-Qaeda and Islamic State shifted international attention to containing this new threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Simultaneously, [[impact_of_russias_international_strategy_on_de_facto_states | Russia]] intervened to support Assad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. By 2020, Syrian government forces controlled two-thirds of the country's territory, and an effective stalemate exists, with Assad still in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Rehabilitation Efforts and Opposition

Despite its long-standing pariah status, there are increasing signs that Syria is slowly being reaccepted into the international system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Reasons for Shifting Opinion

The reality of Assad remaining in power has led some to suggest engaging with Syria again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Arguments in favor of engagement include:
*   Acknowledging the Assad regime's secure hold on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   The necessity to address critical issues like the refugee crisis, which requires communication with Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   Concerns among many countries about Iran's growing influence in the region, which is bolstered by its support for Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   The need to curb Syria's role as a leading producer of amphetamines, which fuels drug problems in other Middle Eastern countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Countries Rebuilding Relations

Several countries have begun to openly engage with Assad:
*   The United Arab Emirates has welcomed Assad for a second visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Oman hosted an official visit from Assad in February 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   Egypt has moved to mend relations with Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   Saudi Arabia, despite its strong opposition to Assad at the start of the war, has joined these states and led calls for Syria's readmission to the Arab League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

If Syria is readmitted to the Arab League, it would represent a crucial step in its rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Continued Opposition

Despite rehabilitation efforts, considerable opposition persists:
*   Qatar insists that Syria's acceptance requires a final political settlement, resolution for the displaced, and an end to repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   Arab League foreign ministers recently decided against lifting Syria's suspension, though efforts to readmit the country are expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   The United States and the European Union remain vehemently opposed to the Assad regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The EU maintains that normalization of relations is contingent upon finding a political solution to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Given this opposition, it is unlikely that Syria will be widely accepted on the world stage again anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Nevertheless, moves to open the door to readmission into the community of Arab states signify a significant moment for this long-standing pariah state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

The role of hybrid threats is an evolving aspect of modern [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. These strategies can manifest in unexpected ways and places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

## Case Study: New Caledonia
In the context of the May 2024 unrest in New Caledonia, France has alleged that the violence was instigated by Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. While this claim might seem unusual, it is linked to the activities of the Baku Initiative Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This group, reportedly operating with the direct backing of the Azerbaijani government, aims to support French liberation and anti-colonialist movements as retaliation for French support of Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

### Tactics Employed
During the riots in New Caledonia, France banned the use of TikTok, arguing that the platform was being used to incite and coordinate the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. This highlights a potential method through which hybrid strategies can influence and escalate conflicts.

### Impact
If Azerbaijan's alleged role in fomenting the rioting is confirmed (an accusation Azerbaijan denies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>, it would serve as an example of how hybrid strategies can emerge in surprising contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Such incidents raise questions about how nations, like France, will address these non-traditional forms of interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

On May 14, 2023, Turkey is set to hold elections that many consider among the most critical in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For two decades, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has profoundly shaped Turkish politics, fundamentally transforming the country and its global standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This period has also seen him become increasingly authoritarian, steering Turkey in a concerning direction both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Early Impact: Liberalization and Western Alignment

Initially, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]]'s rise to power in 2002 defied skepticism from those who feared an overtly religious agenda and a distancing from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Instead, his priority was the [[Erdogans policies and influence | pursuit of European Union membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

Key actions during his first decade included:
*   **Improved International Relations** He prioritized better relations with Greece and sought to resolve the long-standing division of Cyprus, both significant obstacles to Turkey's EU accession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. Turkey formally opened talks to join the European Union in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Domestic Reforms** [[The transformation of Turkey under Erdogans leadership | EU accession]] drove many significant changes internally, including steps to liberalize society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
    *   Restrictions on religion in public life were eased, such as allowing women to wear headscarves in government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
    *   New minority rights were introduced, including Kurdish language education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Civilian Control** Crucially, [[Erdogans administration and changing political outlook | Erdogan]] also reined in the military, which had historically intervened in Turkish politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

## Shift Towards Authoritarianism

Despite these initial positive steps, concerns about [[Erdogans political strategies and authoritarianism | Erdogan]]'s direction began to emerge. Allegations of electoral fraud surfaced in the 2011 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. A pivotal moment occurred in May 2013 with the Gezi Park protests, which started as a small environmental protest but escalated into nationwide demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Following this unrest, [[Erdogans political strategies and authoritarianism | Erdogan]] adopted a more autocratic approach, clamping down on opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

This shift was further highlighted by:
*   **Assumption of Executive Power** In 2014, [[Erdogans administration and changing political outlook | Erdogan]] ran for and won the presidency, a role traditionally largely ceremonial, and appointed a compliant prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Coup Crackdown (2016)** Following a failed military coup attempt on July 15, 2016, the government launched a massive crackdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Thousands were jailed, and anyone suspected of opposing the AKP was purged from jobs in the civil service, military, judiciary, and higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Constitutional Changes (2017)** [[Erdogans political strategies and authoritarianism | Erdogan]] further consolidated his power by introducing constitutional changes in 2017, later approved by referendum, which abolished the post of prime minister and created an executive presidency, similar to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Current Domestic Policy

Under [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]], Turkey has become a "profoundly illiberal state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Concerns include:
*   **Controlled Media** The media is heavily controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
*   **Human Rights** Human rights abuses are rife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   **Democratic System** There are serious worries about the democratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Economy** The economy is in a difficult state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Corruption** There have been persistent allegations of high-level corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Megalomania** [[Erdogans political strategies and authoritarianism | Erdogan]]'s increasingly autocratic rule has been underpinned by a growing megalomania, evidenced by the construction of a massive presidential palace in Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>, legislation making insulting the president a criminal offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, and the decision to rename the country to "TÃ¼rkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Foreign Policy Shifts

[[The impact of geopolitical events on Turkeys diplomacy | On the foreign policy front]], [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] has increasingly moved Turkey away from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>:
*   **EU Membership Halted** His growing authoritarianism has effectively halted any hopes for Turkish EU membership, with talks paused for the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
*   **NATO Concerns** There are significant concerns about Turkey's reliability as a NATO ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
    *   [[Erdogans policies and influence | Erdogan]] has aimed to make Turkey an international actor by building ties across the Balkans, Africa, and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
    *   He has formed a "strange relationship" with Vladimir Putin, purchasing a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile system, which annoyed the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
    *   Turkey has taken an ambivalent stance over Ukraine, continuing to trade with Russia while NATO partners imposed sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Complex Legacy

The [[The transformation of Turkey under Erdogans leadership | Erdogan era]] is characterized by complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. Before his leadership, Turkey faced political chaos, infighting, and heavy restrictions on human and minority rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. For his first decade, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] moved Turkey in a broadly positive direction, attempting to solve the Cyprus issue, introducing significant domestic political and social reforms, and initiating EU accession talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

However, the course he has taken the country over his second decade in power has been genuinely worrying, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. There have even been calls for Turkey to be removed from NATO, and few in the West now regard it as a reliable ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Ultimately, [[Erdogans policies and influence | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has utterly transformed Turkey, initially for the better, but more recently for the worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

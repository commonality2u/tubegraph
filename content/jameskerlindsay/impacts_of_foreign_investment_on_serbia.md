Under the administration of President Aleksandar Vučić, Serbia has experienced significant changes, particularly concerning its economy and the role of foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Opinion is divided on whether these changes have been beneficial or detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Perceived Positive Impacts

Supporters of the current administration highlight that the Serbian economy has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This growth is attributed, in part, to steps taken to increase foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Additionally, major infrastructure projects, such as roads and railways, have been implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Beyond the urban centers, many ordinary Serbs believe that the president has overseen economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Perceived Negative Impacts

Opponents of the administration argue that the quest for foreign investment has caused significant environmental damage to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Specific examples cited include:
*   A major waterfront development in the capital, Belgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   The potential impact of proposed lithium mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

These critics suggest that international partners, including the European Union and the United States, have supported the administration and prioritized stability over democratic principles, thereby being complicit in these outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The [[The Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] is one of Africa's most severe conflicts, resulting in thousands of lives lost, hundreds of thousands displaced, and millions more directly affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This conflict is a significant contemporary example emanating directly from the [[colonial_history_of_cameroon | legacy of colonialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The recurring theme of how borders drawn during colonial times and decisions made at decolonization continue to have lasting effects is particularly evident in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Historical Roots in the Scramble for Africa

The story of the [[The Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon | Anglophone Crisis]] begins in the 19th-century "Scramble for Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Germany, alongside French, British, and Belgian colonial powers, sought its own imperial holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Its most significant acquisition was the territory of Kamerun, which encompassed present-day Cameroon and parts of the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, and Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. German control over this area was formalized in 1884 at the Berlin Conference, which demarcated European colonial influence in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Post-World War I Division

Germany's control over Kamerun ended during the First World War when Britain and France seized and divided the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. France took control of approximately 80 percent of the territory, while Britain controlled the remaining 20 percent, which bordered its largest West African colonial holding, the Colony and Protectorate of [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In 1922, the League of Nations confirmed Britain's control over the British Cameroons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The British Cameroons were administered from neighboring [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] and further divided into two distinct parts: the Northern and Southern Cameroons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Decolonization and Divergent Paths

As decolonization commenced after the Second World War, both British and French Cameroons became UN Trust Territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. On January 1, 1960, the French Cameroons gained independence as the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The future of the British Cameroons then became a critical question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Following UN missions, both parts were offered two options: either join the newly independent [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] or unite with the Republic of Cameroon; full independence was not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Referendums were held on February 11, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>:
*   The predominantly Muslim Northern Cameroons voted by 60 percent to join [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This union took place on May 31, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   The Southern Cameroons, conversely, voted by 70 percent to join the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The UN formally endorsed this result on April 21, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Initially, it was determined that the two parts would unite as a federation, although this process is now contested by Anglophone Cameroonians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. On October 1, 1961, the Southern Cameroons officially joined what became the Federal Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Erosion of Autonomy and the [[Cameroons Anglophone Crisis | Anglophone Crisis]]

The relationship between the Anglophone Southern Cameroons and the [[french_colonial_legacy_and_its_impact | French-speaking majority]] soon deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Despite some Anglophones holding senior office, such as John Foncha who became prime minister and vice president, they felt overpowered by the [[french_colonial_legacy_and_its_impact | French-speaking majority]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The autocratic first president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, constructed a highly centralized federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

In 1972, a referendum abolished the federation and granted more powers to the president, renaming the country the United Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Under President Paul Biya, who replaced Ahidjo in 1982, the Anglophone region (now North West and South West provinces) saw its powers steadily decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Biya also reverted the country's name to the original Republic of Cameroon, further eroding the region's autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

This backdrop led to the formation of the first All Anglophone Conference in 1993, calling for the restoration of the 1961 federal constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Anglophones began campaigning internationally, with former prime minister Foncha advocating for the region's autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. In 1994, demands for independence were raised if their concerns were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Instead, the government further centralized power by changing the constitution and cracking down on what it deemed separatism, leading to arrests and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## The Current Crisis: A Continuation of Historical Grievances

The current phase of the [[Cameroons Anglophone Crisis | crisis]] escalated in late 2016 when protests erupted over the increasing presence of [[Cameroons Anglophone and Francophone divide | French speakers]] in the region's schools and courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The government's crackdown rapidly led to violence as armed groups retaliated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. On October 1, 2017, pro-independence groups declared the creation of an independent Federal Republic of Ambazonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Despite initial calls for peaceful processes, the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | Cameroon government]] launched a major armed campaign against dissent in November 2017, leading to increased militancy among groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. By mid-2019, the situation became increasingly unstable, with civilians also targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The [[Humanitarian Impact of the Crisis in Cameroon | conflict]] has resulted in thousands killed and over half a million displaced, with tens of thousands fleeing to [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Anglophone militias have also targeted schools, viewing them as a means of imposing [[french_colonial_legacy_and_its_impact | French language]] on the local population, leading to the closure of an estimated 80 percent of schools in Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Attempts at Settlement

In 2019, as fighting risked escalating into civil war, President Biya announced a "Major National Dialogue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Proposals included special status for the Anglophone regions, election of local governors, reintegration of fighters, restoration of the name United Republic of Cameroon, and infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. However, these fell short of restoring federalism or meeting demands for full independence, which many Anglophones now seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. International observers also deemed the proposals insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

Despite reports of secret ceasefire talks in July 2020 with jailed pro-independence figures like Julius AyukTabe, who was proclaimed the first president of Ambazonia, fighting continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. There have been growing claims of serious human rights abuses by both sides, including kidnapping and use of child soldiers by militias, and extrajudicial killings and torture by [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[The Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon | Anglophone Crisis]] is a tragic outcome of a colonial and decolonization process that shoehorned peoples with distinct historical experiences and European cultural traditions into a single state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The state's subsequent breakdown occurred as one group asserted authority and abandoned the political system created at independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. A federal settlement guaranteeing extensive autonomy was an obvious solution, and one many Anglophones seemed willing to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, positions have become polarized, with Anglophones deeply mistrusting the central government and committed to independence, while the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | central government]] insists on retaining the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This has led to continued conflict, as many English-speaking Cameroonians no longer wish to be part of the state after decades of repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

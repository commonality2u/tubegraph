El Salvador has a long and complex history with gang violence, which has significantly impacted its society and international standing. Despite efforts to overcome its reputation as one of the world's murder capitals, the country has faced recurring challenges related to organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. In 2015, El Salvador recorded the second-highest violent death rate globally, with 126 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, surpassed only by Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Post-Civil War Genesis of Gangs

The roots of modern gang violence in El Salvador can be traced back to its 13-year civil war (1979-1992) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. During this conflict, many Salvadorians fled to the United States, particularly Los Angeles, where they established a large community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. There, they became involved in the city's burgeoning gang culture, leading to the formation of two major gangs: MS-13 and Barrio 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

While the civil war persisted, gang violence was largely contained within the United States, as convicted gang members could not be deported back to El Salvador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. However, once the conflict concluded in January 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, the United States began to expel these gang members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Upon their return, they brought their gang affiliations with them, causing the situation to escalate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. By the turn of the millennium, El Salvador's gang problem was spiraling out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Attempts at Control and Truces

Successive governments in El Salvador adopted "zero-tolerance" approaches to gang violence, but their efforts to crack down on gangs largely proved ineffective, leading to a steady worsening of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Gangs, with an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 members, not only battled each other but also began targeting police and security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 2012 Gang Truce

In March 2012, a significant and unexpected development occurred when rival gangs reached a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Brokered by a former FMLN commander and a Catholic bishop, and tacitly endorsed by the government, the deal included agreements to declare certain public areas, such as schools, off-limits, and saw a decrease in attacks against security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In return, steps were taken to reform the prison system, where gang members were often held in dire conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Initially, the truce appeared successful, leading to a rapid and significant drop in the violent death rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Within a year, the number of murders reportedly declined by 40%, from approximately 70 per 100,000 people to around 40 per 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

However, the truce became increasingly unpopular among large segments of society, police, and security forces, who believed it granted gangs too much power and allowed them to regroup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The truce was short-lived, with the Supreme Court ruling the appointment of the justice minister (instrumental in the process) illegal in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. A new president took office in June 2014, refusing to recognize the truce and insisting on developing his own strategy, which led to a sharp deterioration of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. By 2015, the murder rate surged again, exceeding that of many conflict zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## International Repercussions

The escalating violence had severe wider [[Impact of gang violence on El Salvadors international relations | international effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Thousands of Salvadorians fled the country, leading to a significant exodus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. By 2016, Salvadorians constituted the second-largest group of unauthorized migrants to the United States and the largest single nationality legally granted asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Images of refugees from El Salvador, along with those fleeing violence in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras (which also faced gang problems), contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment that influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Recent Developments Under Nayib Bukele

The situation began to improve with the election of [[Nayib Bukele and his approach to gang violence | Nayib Bukele]] as president in May 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. [[Nayib Bukele and his approach to gang violence | Bukele]] promised to tackle gang violence and swiftly introduced tough new measures, including targeted crackdowns in gang strongholds and increased police and military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Social programs were also introduced in impoverished areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

However, [[Nayib Bukele and his approach to gang violence | Bukele]]'s approach also faced controversy. Reports emerged that government representatives had met with jailed gang leaders, allegedly offering special privileges in exchange for reduced violence, a claim denied by [[Nayib Bukele and his approach to gang violence | Bukele]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Regardless of these allegations, the government's efforts appeared effective. By the end of 2020, the situation had dramatically improved, with murders dropping to just over 1,300 from 6,500 a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. On January 27, 2021, [[Nayib Bukele and his approach to gang violence | President Bukele]] announced that El Salvador had gone 48 hours without a gun death for the first time in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Despite a three-day outbreak of violence in November 2021 that left 40 dead, the year concluded with 1,140 deaths, indicating continued improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### March 2022 Spike and State of Emergency

Against this backdrop of apparent progress, a sudden surge of violence occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. On March 26, 2022, 62 people were killed in a single day, marking the highest daily death toll since the end of the civil war 30 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

In response, the government quickly acted, imposing an [[El Salvador state of emergency and gang violence | state of emergency]] (which has since been extended) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Police began mass arrests of suspected gang members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. A raft of other new measures was introduced, many of which have been condemned by leading international human rights organizations, including the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

One of the most [[Controversial measures and human rights concerns in El Salvador | controversial measures and human rights concerns in El Salvador]] included a law criminalizing reporting on gang activities that could "generate panic and anxiety amongst the general population," an offense punishable by up to 15 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This legislation has drawn heavy criticism from human rights organizations and the U.S. State Department, which emphasized the importance of journalistic freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. These steps are viewed as part of growing concerns about El Salvador's overall direction and [[Controversial measures and human rights concerns in El Salvador | President Bukele]]'s increasing authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Somaliland, a territory in the Horn of Africa on the coast of the Gulf of Aden, has effectively existed as a fully independent entity for over three decades, having seceded from Somalia in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Despite meeting the main criteria for statehood and enjoying considerable international sympathy, it remains completely unrecognised by the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its efforts to persuade the international community to recognise it have failed, leading to an uphill battle for formal [[somalilands_quest_for_international_recognition | international acceptance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_somaliland_independence | Historical Context]] and Path to De Facto Independence

Somaliland first emerged in the late 19th century as the British Somaliland Protectorate, established in 1884 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It gained independence as the State of Somaliland on June 26, 1960, and was immediately recognised by over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, it merged with the Italian-administered Trust Territory of Somaliland on July 1, 1960, to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This union quickly became strained due to a new constitution in 1961 that downgraded Somaliland to an autonomous province and increasing marginalisation by the central government in Mogadishu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Following a coup in 1969, General Siad Barre's dictatorial rule further increased alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. A brutal suppression of an uprising in the late 1980s led to tens of thousands of deaths and the heavy bombing of Hargeisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. When Barre was overthrown in January 1991, Somalia descended into civil war and anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Seizing this opportunity, Somaliland unilaterally declared, or "reclaimed," its independence on May 18, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Meeting Statehood Criteria

In the three decades since its secession, Somaliland has consolidated its position and is widely accepted to meet the criteria for statehood as laid down by the Montevideo Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

*   **Defined Territory**: Somaliland has a defined territory, although this is complicated by an ongoing boundary dispute with neighbouring [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Puntland]], an autonomous province of Somalia, and a secessionist movement in eastern Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Settled Population**: It clearly possesses a settled population, estimated at 3.5 to 4 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Government**: Somaliland has a demonstrably independent government that has been a bastion of calm and stability, in contrast to the political chaos in Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Capacity to Enter into Relations with Other States**: Somaliland enjoys greater international acceptance than many other unrecognised states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It maintains good relations with its neighbours and has established representative offices in the United States and several European and African countries, though these lack formal diplomatic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Key Diplomatic Ties

Somaliland maintains particularly close ties with Britain, which provides aid and whose officials frequently meet with Somaliland leaders in London and Hargeisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. A significant instance was the official visit of then-British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson in January 2019, where he met with the President and other high-ranking officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Despite these engagements, London continues to insist that it recognises the territorial integrity of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Somaliland also possesses other symbols of statehood, including its own flag, currency, and armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It enjoys direct flights to neighbouring countries such as [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | Ethiopia]], Kenya, and Dubai, making it relatively accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Challenges to [[somalilands_struggle_for_international_recognition | International Recognition]]

The lack of formal [[somaliland_struggle_for_international_recognition | international recognition]] for Somaliland is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While its previous independence is a strong moral argument for Somaliland leaders, under international law, a territory that voluntarily gives up independence to join another country does not have a right to reclaim statehood at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Despite this, Somaliland has not faced the typical opprobrium associated with unilateral secession, possibly because it was once an independent country and its situation is not one of invasion or occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### African Union Stance

In 2005, an African Union fact-finding mission to Somaliland recommended recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The report highlighted Somaliland's progress toward becoming a "modern state" and noted its situation as "unique and self-justified in African political history," suggesting it "should not be linked to the notion of opening a Pandora's box" of secessionist precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This was seen as a potential path to full [[somalilands_quest_for_international_recognition | international recognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. However, despite this steer, African countries were unable to reach a consensus, and Somaliland remained unrecognised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Wider International Concerns

A significant obstacle to [[somalilands_struggle_for_international_recognition | international acceptance]] is the long-standing nervousness in Africa about redrawing borders, despite the AU report's findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Additionally, Western countries, including the UK, are concerned about the [[impact_of_somalilands_unrecognized_status_on_regional_stability | impact of Somaliland's unrecognized status on regional stability]] and potential independence on ongoing efforts since 2012 to stabilise and rebuild Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. There is a fear that if Somaliland gains independence, other parts of Somalia might follow, exacerbating problems like warlordism, terrorist groups, and piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Efforts to bring the sides into formal peace talks further complicate the issue, as few countries want to prejudice the outcome by granting recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

While some in Somaliland argue that geopolitical factors, such as increasing interest in their port facilities (including reports of Russia seeking a naval base), could work in their favour for recognition, this remains speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

Somaliland is a fascinating and unique case in international politics, existing in a "strange grey zone" regarding secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Despite its previous independent status not formally influencing its claim, it does shape perceptions about its case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. It unequivocally meets the four conditions for statehood: a defined territory, a settled population, an independent government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

There is not the same hostility towards Somaliland's independence as seen in other secession cases; many tacitly understand and sympathise with its case, given the instability of the rest of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Its primary challenge is not strong opposition to its existence as an independent state but rather international concern about the broader implications of formally recognising that independence, particularly African concerns about secession and Western concerns about Somalia's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

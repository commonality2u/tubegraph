Growing concerns have emerged regarding [[increasing_military_activity_in_the_south_china_sea | China's increasing military activity]] around the Spratly Islands in the [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | South China Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This gained international attention when a CNN team witnessed the Chinese Air Force warning a US plane to leave international airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The Philippines has also expressed concerns about a significant increase in the Chinese presence near the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This situation has reignited fears about the [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | possibility of armed conflict]] in an area claimed by no less than six different actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Nature of Territorial Disputes

While territorial disputes are often perceived as conflicts over land borders, they predominantly involve maritime boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These disputes concern competing claims over territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), which allow states to use areas for fishing and mineral exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. When different countries contest islands, control over a small territory can grant significantly extended maritime and airspace rights over a vast area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The Spratly Islands serve as a prime example of such a dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Spratly Islands

The Spratly Islands are situated in the [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | South China Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They are largely uninhabited, consisting of over a hundred tiny islets, reefs, and atolls, many of which are wholly or partially submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. At most, about 20 of these are considered significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The largest, Itu Aba, is approximately 1.4 kilometers (under a mile) long and 400 meters (a quarter of a mile) wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Despite their small size, the islands cover a vast area of around 400,000 square kilometers (160,000 square miles), making them militarily, economically, and strategically valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Claiming the territory allows countries to control territorial waters and undersea resources across much of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This includes control over one of the world's most important shipping lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, access to significant fishing banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, and potential oil and gas deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Claimants

Although the islands have been disputed for over a century, tensions have escalated as China has asserted its claims more forcefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A total of six parties claim the islands, either entirely or in part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. These claimants are:
*   China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   The Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Brunei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

Many observers believe this situation could lead to a full-scale armed confrontation between China and its neighbours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Historical Background

The history of the Spratly Islands dates back almost 2,000 years, with Chinese fishermen believed to be the first discoverers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. They were later mentioned in Imperial Chinese records and were considered an extension of the Paracel Islands, which are subject to a separate dispute between China, Taiwan, and [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

European involvement began in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. While Portuguese explorers were likely the first Europeans to visit, Spain formally claimed the territory and built a lighthouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. In the 19th century, other European colonial powers asserted claims; France considered them part of Indochina (present-day [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam]]), though this was not internationally recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Britain also claimed the territory, naming them after a British sea captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. During World War II, Imperial Japan seized the territory until its defeat in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Post-WWII Escalation

After World War II, the question of sovereignty intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   In 1947, the Republic of China (later based in Taiwan) published a map including the Spratly Islands as Chinese territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   The Communist People's Republic of China, established in 1949, also claimed the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   By the following decade, [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam]] and the Philippines, now independent states, also claimed sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

The issue took on a "dangerous and destabilizing dimension" as countries began establishing small military presences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Taiwan set up an outpost on Itu Aba in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, followed by [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam]] and the Philippines in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Regional tensions escalated, including a clash between Chinese and South Vietnamese naval forces over the Paracel Islands in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Malaysia claimed part of the territory in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, and Brunei followed in 1984 after gaining independence from Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Conflict and Land Reclamation

By the late 1980s, the situation became more complex and tense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Violence erupted in 1988 when China forcibly removed [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam's]] military presence in the "Battle of Johnson South Reef" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Following this, Beijing began an ambitious scheme to reclaim land around reefs and atolls to create artificial islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This activity significantly increased in 2013, with China reclaiming an estimated 13 square kilometers (five square miles) of land over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

China's assertiveness led to pushback from other countries, including the United States, which sent a warship to the area in October 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## International Legal Challenge

In a significant development, the Philippines referred China's claims to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Manila argued that Beijing's claim based on history was invalid and that any claim should be judged under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   China refused to participate, disputing the Court's jurisdiction, but the case proceeded as both countries were parties to UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Court's Ruling (2016)

The judges did not rule on the sovereignty of the islands themselves, as land territories are not subject to UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. They also did not delineate maritime boundaries, which would require prior agreement on sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Instead, the Court focused on which states had rights within the waters and on what grounds: historical relationship (China's insistence) versus international law under UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

The Court ruled against China, stating that rights to maritime zones should be based on UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It found that:
*   China's actions, including land reclamation, had aggravated the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Beijing had infringed on the Philippines' rights within its exclusive economic zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Crucially, none of the so-called Spratly Islands were, in fact, "islands" as understood under UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Therefore, even if China had sovereignty, it would not confer an exclusive economic zone that would infringe on other states' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The Court called on both parties to comply with UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

China refused to accept the ruling, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson calling it "pure political drama" orchestrated by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. China also refuses to take the ownership issue to another legal body, such as the International Court of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Current Tensions and Militarization

Tensions continue to rise as Beijing steadily builds its presence on the islands, constructing military bases on three of them despite earlier assurances by President Xi Jinping that China would not militarize the territory further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Other claimants have also increased their activities:
*   [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions | Vietnam]] has reportedly dredged parts of the territory, creating around 220 hectares of new land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   Malaysia controls a reef it captured in the 1980s, which has since been transformed into an island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   Brunei is the only claimant without a presence on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Although Indonesia does not claim the islands, it has publicly challenged [[chinas_historical_claims_versus_international_law_in_the_south_china_sea | China's claim]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Recent tensions include an incident in February 2023, where the Philippines accused the Chinese Coast Guard of shadowing, harassing, engaging in dangerous manoeuvres, and directing a military-grade laser at one of its vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This incident, while not leading to an exchange of fire, has fueled growing tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The Philippines accuses China of threatening its sovereignty and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. suggesting the Armed Forces of the Philippines must reorient their mission against Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. He characterized the Spratly Islands dispute as more difficult and complex than the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Outlook

The Spratly Islands dispute is exceedingly complex due to the multiple countries claiming parts or all of the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While UNCLOS offers clarity, its framework for resolution would essentially exclude China and Taiwan, creating significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The critical questions remain how far China will push its disputed claim and how far other states are willing to defend their positions, potentially risking an [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | armed confrontation]] with Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Despite international focus on a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the Spratly Islands may become a more likely focal point for conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. With numerous actors involved, this collection of rocks, reefs, and atolls could become the center of a bitter regional war if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

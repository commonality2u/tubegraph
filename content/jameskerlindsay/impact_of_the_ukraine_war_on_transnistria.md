As the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_serbia_russia_relations | war in Ukraine continues]], attention has increasingly focused on neighboring Moldova and its breakaway region of [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. With reports of growing unrest, it has been suggested that [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] could be Moscow's next target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The conflict has raised significant questions about the future of [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Background on [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]

Moldova is located in southeast Europe, between Romania and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], also known as Trans-Dniester, is situated at Moldova's eastern edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It covers 4,200 square kilometers (1,600 square miles), making up just over 10% of Moldova's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

In 1812, the Ottoman Empire ceded Moldavia's eastern provinces, known as Bessarabia, to Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. While western Moldavia later united with Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania in 1881, Bessarabia remained under Russian rule until 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. After the Russian Revolution, local leaders declared Bessarabia's independence and united with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The Soviet Union never accepted this unification and, in 1924, established the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within Soviet Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This entity was located on the east bank of the Dniester River, a Slavic area not traditionally considered part of Romanian-speaking Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

When the Soviet Union seized Bessarabia at the start of World War II, Bessarabia and Trans-Dniester were combined on August 2, 1940, to form the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Moscow subsequently altered the demographic balance, and by 1989, Romanian-speaking Moldovans constituted about two-thirds of the population, with Ukrainians and Russians each making up around 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

As the Soviet Union weakened, Moldovan leaders emphasized their Romanian-Moldovan identity, leading to tensions with [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], where the largely Slavic population maintained closer ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Transnistria]]'s De Facto Independence

In August 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] unilaterally declared independence, forming the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Major fighting erupted between Moldovan and [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistrian]] forces on March 2, 1992, the same day the independent Republic of Moldova joined the UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The Russian army stationed in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] intervened to defend the breakaway republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

A ceasefire was agreed in July 1992 after four and a half months of conflict and about a thousand deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. As part of the agreement, Russian troops remained as part of a peacekeeping force, and Moscow also retained a separate contingent of troops in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] that remain to this day, despite a UN General Assembly call for their withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This solidified [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]'s status as an internationally unrecognized de facto state under Moscow's protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Stalled Resolution Efforts

Efforts to resolve the conflict under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Russia, Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States proved impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Moldova was unwilling to grant significant power to [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], especially if it allowed [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]] influence in internal Moldovan affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistrian]] leaders, content with Russian financial support, were unwilling to give up their "criminal statelet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Moreover, the dispute served as a bargaining chip for Moscow, effectively blocking Moldova's pursuit of EU and NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This led to a comfortable status quo for both sides, with increasing willingness to interact but no significant movement towards a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_moldovas_strategy | war in Ukraine]] has now put this settled situation at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## [[potential_outcomes_and_solutions_for_the_transnistria_conflict | Potential Outcomes and Solutions]]

### Russian Invasion or Annexation

The most immediate concern is that [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]] might invade [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. While this seems unlikely given the current unfolding of the war, such an event would have a profound impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Moscow would likely recognize [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] as independent, possibly followed by annexation, similar to Crimea and potentially Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

This would be a worrying development, transforming [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] from a Russian-occupied de facto state to Russian annexed territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The population of [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] could find themselves cut off from Moldova and the wider world, potentially leading many Moldovans and Ukrainians to leave, with only Russians remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Despite any annexation, [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] would still be internationally recognized as part of Moldova, leaving the conflict officially unresolved and potentially open to a settlement in a post-Putin era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Moldova Retaking [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] by Force

Some might suggest Moldova could attempt to retake [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] by force while [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]] is preoccupied in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. However, this is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The Moldovan government has publicly committed to a peaceful settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Moldova's army is small and poorly equipped, and while [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]]'s forces in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] are weak, an attempt by Moldova could provoke a devastating Russian response, including potential airstrikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Moldova's options for outside help are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Neighboring Romania, a NATO member, cannot directly intervene without risking a serious confrontation between [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]] and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Ukraine Launching an Attack on [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian Forces]] in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]

Ukraine might launch an attack on [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian forces]] in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] to secure its southwestern flank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This could happen if [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] prepares to join the attack on Ukraine, a potential unexpected surprise of the [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Negotiated Settlement

Pushing for a negotiated settlement currently seems difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Talks are unlikely while the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_moldovas_strategy | war in Ukraine]] continues, as [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistrian]] leaders would not abandon their claim to independence as long as they hope for Russian support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]]'s military presence would also prevent them from negotiating behind Moscow's back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

A change could occur if the war goes poorly for [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]], rendering Moscow unable to provide political, military, or financial assistance to [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Even then, reaching a deal would be challenging, as Moldova might be reluctant to offer high autonomy or a federal settlement to a weakened [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Moldova Accepting [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]'s Independence

Some have suggested Moldova might consider ditching the problem altogether by accepting [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]'s independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This is extremely unlikely, as states rarely voluntarily give up territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. While it might offer advantages like ending a long-running dispute and potentially opening doors for Moldova to EU or even NATO membership (though currently off the table due to neutrality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, it carries major problems.

Firstly, roughly a third of [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]'s population is Moldovan, making it difficult for Moldova to abandon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Secondly, there are wider geopolitical complications: an independent [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] could become another Russian client state, or even seek union with [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]], becoming a Russian exclave like Kaliningrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Given [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]]'s strong presence, it's unlikely that an independent [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] would develop closer relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite the tumultuous events in Ukraine, the possibility remains that [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] could remain a frozen conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Rather than a peaceful or forceful resolution, a continuation of the status quo might occur, albeit within a new geopolitical context of extremely tense relations between [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia]] and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. However, there is a growing sense that the future of [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], and Moldova generally, heavily depends on the course of the ongoing [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_moldovas_strategy | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

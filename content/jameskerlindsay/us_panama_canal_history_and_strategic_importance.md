Recent events involving the incoming [[trump_administration_and_panama_canal_control | Trump Administration]] and Panama have raised questions about the control of the Panama Canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. On December 21, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump posted a message on social media threatening Panama over its management of the crucial waterway, which prompted a strong reaction from the Panamanian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This escalation has led to concerns about potential military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Panama Canal: A Vital Waterway

Strategic waterways are critical in [[international relations]] due to their role in connecting major oceans or seas, shortening shipping routes, and facilitating global trade and military movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. They are often central to [[geopolitical_tensions_over_strategic_waterways | geopolitical tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The Panama Canal, located in the Republic of Panama, is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This 82 km (51-mile) waterway links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, significantly reducing the 13,000 km (8,000-mile) route around South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

For the United States, the canal holds unique importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. As the largest user, accounting for about 60% of its traffic, the canal is vital for transporting agricultural products, industrial goods, and energy supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It also provides a crucial passage for the U.S. military, allowing the US Navy to move between the East and West Coasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This makes it economically and militarily essential for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Historical Context of the Canal

Panama's history began with indigenous peoples, later chartered by Spanish explorers in the early 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It became a crucial trade route for gold and silver within the Spanish Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 1821, Panama gained independence from Spain and became part of Gran Colombia, a union of former Spanish colonial territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Although Gran Colombia later dissolved, Panama remained under Colombian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### French Construction Efforts

The strategic value of a waterway across the Isthmus of Panama was long recognized, but serious construction efforts began after the successful completion of the Suez Canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In 1881, Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French engineer behind the Suez Canal, started the Panama Canal project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, the project faced significant engineering challenges, widespread disease, and mismanagement, leading to its abandonment in 1889 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### US Involvement and Panamanian Independence

Despite the French failure, the United States was keen to continue the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. When Colombia rejected a treaty allowing the US to resume construction, Washington supported Panamanian rebels seeking independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. On November 3, 1903, a revolt erupted, and the US prevented Colombian forces from intervening, leading to Panama's declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Less than two weeks later, on November 18, 1903, the US signed a treaty with the new Panamanian administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. In exchange for guaranteeing Panama's independence, the United States gained perpetual and complete control over a 10-mile (15 km) wide zone surrounding the canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Work resumed, and the canal was completed ten years later in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## US Control and the Handover

The completion of the canal was a global trade milestone, but resentment among Panamanians grew steadily due to significant US influence over the country's internal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The Canal Zone, operating under US law, enjoyed special privileges and became significantly wealthier than the rest of Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

In 1964, protests erupted, highlighting widespread opposition to US domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Recognizing the damage to US interests, especially as the canal became a symbol of American imperialism during the Cold War, President Jimmy Carter initiated negotiations on its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### The 1977 Treaties and Handover

On September 7, 1977, the United States and Panama signed an agreement, comprising two main elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>:
1.  **Full Panamanian Control**: After a period of joint administration, Panama would gain complete control of the canal on December 31, 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
2.  **Neutrality**: The canal would remain neutral territory, allowing ships from all countries, including military vessels, to use it freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Crucially, this was underpinned by a clause allowing the US to intervene militarily to protect the canal's neutrality if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

This [[panama_canal_handover_and_international_relations | Panama Canal handover and international relations]] agreement faced opposition in the United States, particularly from conservative Republicans, who argued it was a dangerous surrender of US interests over a vital asset built and paid for by the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Concerns also arose about Panama's ability, as a small and unstable country, to oversee the canal's security and maintain its neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

These fears seemingly gained traction after the death of Panama's military leader, General Omar Torrijos, in 1981, leading to the rise of General Manuel Noriega <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Under Noriega, Panama became a corrupt and violent criminal state and a hub for international drug trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. As a result, the US invaded Panama in December 1989, overthrowing and arresting Noriega <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. With Panama under democratic control, preparations for the canal's handover continued, and the transition was completed as planned on New Year's Eve 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Post-Handover Tensions and Current Issues

The successful handover marked a critical turning point for Panama, leading to its steady growth as a global trade hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In 2016, an expansion project further increased the canal's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

However, despite initially good relations with the United States, tensions have emerged over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The US has frequently expressed concerns about corruption and a lack of transparency in Panama's financial dealings, highlighted by the "Panama Papers" scandal, which revealed the use of Panamanian entities for worldwide tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Additionally, differences regarding the canal itself have arisen due to two main factors:
*   **Increasing Transit Fees**: Citing rising maintenance costs, canal expansion expenses, and climate change issues like reduced rainfall affecting water levels, the Panamanian government has increased tolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. These increases have disproportionately affected US shipping, leading to complaints from US businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Element**: In 2017, Panama switched its diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the People's Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Since then, [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China has invested significantly]] in Panama, funding and building ports and other canal-related infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This has fueled general US concerns about [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China's rise]] and specific worries that Beijing may exert too much control over Panama and the strategically vital waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. These concerns have led to renewed complaints in some US circles that the United States should never have given up control of the canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Trump Administration's Stance

Against this backdrop, President-elect Donald Trump posted a lengthy message on Truth Central on December 21, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. He emphasized the canal's vital importance to the US and the costs of its construction, insisting that Panama should administer the canal solely and not rely on others like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. He also condemned the fees faced by US shipping, calling for the "ripoff" to stop immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Panama's President, Jose R. Molino, swiftly responded, asserting that every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent zone belongs to Panama and will remain so, stating, "The sovereignty and independence of our country are not negotiable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Trump retorted with another post, "We'll see about that," followed by an image of a US flag over water with the caption "Welcome to the United States Canal!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Potential US Actions

Given the aggressive tone, immediate concerns arose about potential military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. However, observers note that Trump has generally shied away from military engagements, and his campaign focused on avoiding overseas conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Nevertheless, as an issue directly affecting US economic and commercial interests, which Trump closely monitors, he might view this differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Any aggressive move to reclaim control of the canal would likely face significant international opposition and would certainly violate international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The 1977 treaty does not permit unilateral military action to reclaim control of the Canal Zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

Observers suggest the incoming administration has other avenues to address its concerns, leading to discussions about the [[us_response_to_panama_canal_management_under_trumps_leadership | US response to Panama Canal management under Trump's leadership]]:
*   **Diplomatic Negotiations**: The US could pursue diplomatic negotiations to discuss fees and limit external influence over the canal, though strained relations make this more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Judicial Solution**: A judicial solution, such as arbitration or mediation by a third party, is explicitly allowed by Article 14 of the 1977 treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Economic Measures**: The new administration could introduce sanctions or offer Panama economic incentives to influence its decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The outcome of this "odd and somewhat surprising spat" remains uncertain, posing another significant question about the effects of a second Trump term on global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

The [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]], which began in early 2022, has significantly impacted Russia's long-standing influence in Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This conflict has fueled a sense that Moscow's grip on the region is finally coming to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Historical Context of Russian Influence

For decades after gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Central Asian republics remained closely tied to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This tethering was economic, political, and social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Key aspects of this influence included:
*   Membership in Russian-led organizations like the Commonwealth of Independent States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Substantial Russian communities residing in republics, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   Russian remaining the common language across the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## The Turning Point: [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia-Ukraine Conflict]]

Since the start of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]], there has been a growing and surprisingly rapid decline in Moscow's long-standing influence over Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This shift has prompted Central Asian states to explore closer cooperation among themselves, notably through the Organization of Turkic States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Responses from Central Asian States
*   **Kazakhstan**: Despite being a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russian-led security bloc, Kazakhstan has consistently avoided signaling support for Russia's actions in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Kazakhstan appears to be actively seeking to distance itself from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Uzbekistan**: Similar trends of distancing from Russia have also been observed in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Latent Tensions with Azerbaijan
While not a Central Asian state, Azerbaijan, a Turkic state in the Caucasus, has also experienced growing latent tensions with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This tension emerged after Moscow prevented Azerbaijan from expelling Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh by deploying a Russian peacekeeping force, which solidified Russia's presence in that specific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Broad Geopolitical Shift
The war has compelled Turkic countries to work together more closely, leading to a growing awareness of the potential value of their strong ethnocultural ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This shift signifies a departure from a thousand years of separation between the Turkic communities in the East and the Turkish people in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

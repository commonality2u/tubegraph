Cyprus, a Mediterranean island often considered an unlikely conflict zone, remains home to one of the most entrenched [[ethnic_conflict_in_cyprus | ethnic conflicts]] in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Despite being a vibrant holiday destination, it was the scene of bitter fighting in the 1960s and 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The island still hosts the world's longest-running major [[United Nations peacekeeping in Cyprus | United Nations peacemaking and peacekeeping mission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. After nearly 60 years of efforts to find a settlement, many question whether the [[Cyprus Dispute and its Impact | Cyprus Dispute]] can still be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Background to the Division

Cyprus is located at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While the Republic of Cyprus is the only internationally recognized state on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, the country is divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), recognized only by Turkey, occupies approximately 36-37 percent of the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Additionally, Britain maintains two large military bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The island's population is estimated at 1.2 million, though exact numbers and the proportions of Greek and Turkish Cypriots are contested due to a steady flow of settlers from mainland Turkey to the north since the island was divided in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In 1960, at independence, Greek Cypriots constituted 78 percent of the population, Turkish Cypriots 18 percent, and 4 percent were from Maronite, Armenian, and Latin communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## [[Historical background of Cyprus conflict | Historical Context of the Conflict]]

The island's rich history, sitting at the meeting point of Europe, Asia, and Africa, saw its turning point in 1571 with the Ottoman Empire's conquest, leading to the arrival of the first Turkish inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. In 1878, administrative control passed to Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The Greek Christian majority's ambition for "enosis" (union with the Kingdom of Greece) was rejected by Britain, even after Cyprus became a British Crown Colony in 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1955, Greek Cypriots launched an armed campaign for enosis, which in turn sparked calls by Turkish Cypriots for "taksim" (partition between Greece and Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

In 1959, Greece and Turkey reached a compromise: Cyprus would become an independent state with shared power between the two communities, guaranteed by Greece, Turkey, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The Republic of Cyprus was formally established on August 16, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

However, tensions persisted. Many Greek Cypriots resented being denied union with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The power-sharing system quickly strained over issues like local government and military division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Fighting erupted in December 1963 after Turkey rejected Greek Cypriot constitutional proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Peace was restored in March 1964 with the establishment of a [[United Nations peacekeeping in Cyprus | UN peacekeeping force]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

In July 1974, violence erupted again when the military regime in Greece attempted to overthrow the Cypriot government to secure enosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Turkey, using its guarantor rights, invaded the island, leading to the displacement of 200,000 Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the division of Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Past Reunification Efforts

Following the 1974 division, the UN continued settlement efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In 1977, both sides agreed that any solution would be based on a "bizonal, bicommunal federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Despite this, in November 1983, Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence, a move condemned by the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Talks throughout the 1980s and 90s remained deadlocked due to the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leadership, backed by Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

By 2000, as Cyprus prepared to join the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, a new UN initiative was launched. In 2004, the UN proposed a plan for reunification, which was endorsed internationally and accepted by two-thirds of Turkish Cypriots, but rejected by three-quarters of Greek Cypriots in a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The most recent major initiative was a UN-convened conference in 2017, which also failed to secure a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Key Points of Disagreement

The challenges to reunification stem from three key points of difference between the sides:

1.  **[[Governance and political disagreements in Cyprus | Governance]]**: This concerns the structure of the federal state and community representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Turkish Cypriots insist on political equality, fearing marginalization by the Greek Cypriot majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Greek Cypriots seek a functional state and safeguards against future secession by Turkish Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
2.  **Territory and Property**: While Turkish Cypriots currently control 36-37 percent of the island, observers believe this would need to be reduced to 25-29 percent in a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Questions remain about the return of Greek Cypriot property in Turkish Cypriot-controlled areas, or compensation for those who cannot or do not wish to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
3.  **Security**: This is particularly sensitive for Greek Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Under the 1960 settlement, Greece and Turkey were allowed to station troops and had the right to intervene, as occurred in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Greek Cypriots demand the removal of these provisions, while Turkish Cypriots view Turkish troops and intervention rights as essential security guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Additional issues include the status of Turkish settlers, the nature of a future peacekeeping force, and the management of transitional arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Prospects for Solution: A Matter of Political Will

Theoretically, the [[Cyprus Dispute and its Impact | Cyprus Dispute]] is not overly complex; a settlement framework is largely understood and could be achieved quickly with sufficient political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, the core problem is precisely this lack of political will in both communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Greek Cypriot Attitudes

Attitudes among Greek Cypriots are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>:
*   **Pro-reunification**: Some genuinely favor a federal agreement and reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Hardline Nationalists**: Others oppose any federal agreement, viewing Cyprus as Greek and Turkish Cypriots as unwanted newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Fear of Reunification**: Many fear reunification could be too risky, potentially leading to a return to political deadlock and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Given Cyprus's current stability as a holiday and business hub, there's concern that reunification might undermine this success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

A future reunification vote among Greek Cypriots is expected to be incredibly close, posing a dilemma for leaders who prefer to avoid another rejection and the world giving up on settlement talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Turkish Cypriot Attitudes

While the general view is that Turkish Cypriots might vote for reunification, it cannot be taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>:
*   **Hardliners**: Many Turkish Cypriots staunchly oppose reunification, preferring their unrecognised state to reuniting with Greek Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Moderate Demands**: Even moderate Turkish Cypriots, who see advantages in reunification, especially given Ankara's growing control in the north, often make reunification difficult by demanding too much or failing to assess the situation realistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Turkey's Influence**: Turkey wields an increasingly tight grip over the north, and there are fears Ankara may attempt to annex the north, which would end any hope of reunification for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Generational Divide

Contrary to expectations, time does not appear to be fostering more moderate, pro-settlement voices among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Younger Greek and Turkish Cypriots often have little to no experience of truly living together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The "other side" is perceived as a foreign country inhabited by "alien" people, despite a shared Cypriot heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Conclusion

While a theoretical settlement for the [[Cyprus Dispute and its Impact | Cyprus Dispute]] is certainly possible, the current lack of political will, coupled with legitimate concerns from both communities and growing external influences, makes a practical agreement seem increasingly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

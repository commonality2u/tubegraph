In recent months, the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]] has increased high-profile attacks, raising concerns about its re-emergence as a significant challenge to Pakistan's peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has also prompted questions about the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Afghanistan has been a central issue in international relations for over half a century, frequently at the forefront of news after invasions by the Soviet Union in 1979 and the United States in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

While many observers credit Pakistan with creating the Taliban, the broader relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is complex and fascinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Geographic and Demographic Overview

Pakistan and Afghanistan are located in South Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Pakistan**: Approximately 880,000 square kilometers (340,000 square miles), making it the 33rd largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Its population is around 230 million, ranking fifth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Afghanistan**: Located to Pakistan's Northwest, it covers about 650,000 square kilometers (250,000 square miles), making it the 40th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Its population is approximately 40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Both countries are predominantly Sunni Muslim but are ethnically diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A key ethnic group in understanding their relationship is the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Speaking a language related to Iranian, Pashtuns number around 50 million people, spread across South Afghanistan and West and Northwest Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. They constitute about half of Afghanistan's population and 15% of Pakistan's, where they are the second largest group after the Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## British Influence and the Durand Line

The complex history of Pakistan and Afghanistan largely begins in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. After consolidating its position in the Indian subcontinent, including present-day Pakistan, Britain expanded northward into Afghanistan, which was also a target for Russian imperial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

*   **1855**: Britain and the Emirate of Afghanistan established friendly relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **1878**: As Russian influence grew, Britain launched another invasion, which was repelled, but led to Afghanistan becoming a British protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **1893**: The border was formally defined along the Durand Line, which significantly divided traditional [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **1919-1946**: Afghanistan's protectorate status ended in 1919, it became a fully independent Kingdom in the 1920s, and joined the United Nations in 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Formation of Pakistan and Initial Strains

In 1947, British rule in India ended, leading to partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Predominantly Hindu areas became the Republic of India, while Muslim areas in the north formed the Dominion of Pakistan, which later became the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

From its inception, relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan were strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Afghanistan questioned the borders of the new Pakistani state, arguing that the Durand Line was not meant to be an official boundary and called for the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] areas to be placed under its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   Afghanistan was the only country to vote against Pakistan's membership in the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Afghanistan supported [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] separatist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Diplomatic relations were severed for several years in the early 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   These problems persisted even after the Afghan King was deposed and the country became a republic in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Soviet Invasion and the Rise of the Taliban

The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, following a Marxist military coup and growing opposition, completely transformed the relationship with Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Pakistan, as a close Western ally, became a vital route for U.S. and international assistance to the mujahideen, who were fighting the Soviet occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This support continued even after the USSR withdrew in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Instead of stability, Afghanistan descended into civil war as various mujahideen groups fought each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This created an opening for the Taliban, a new group composed of [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | ethnic Pashtuns]] educated in Pakistan's religious schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment saw an opportunity to gain control over Afghanistan and began supporting the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The Taliban rapidly grew in strength, emerging in 1994 and seizing Kabul by September 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Taliban Rule and Post-9/11 Dynamics

Upon gaining power, the Taliban imposed an extreme form of Islamic rule, strictly applying Sharia law, curtailing human and women's rights, and destroying cultural heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Afghanistan also became a haven for militant Islamist groups targeting the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This culminated in the Al-Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, leading to the invasion of Afghanistan by the U.S. and NATO forces, which forced the Taliban from power by the end of 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Despite being one of only three countries (alongside Saudi Arabia and the UAE) that recognized the Taliban regime, Pakistan's continued support became impossible after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Although Islamabad publicly disavowed the Taliban and joined the "War on Terror," it maintained close ties, providing sanctuary for many Taliban leaders and fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Emergence of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)

Under increasing pressure to act against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, Pakistan launched a major military operation in 2004 in the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]]-dominated Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This incursion, involving about 70,000 troops in an area previously off-limits, provoked widespread anger among local leaders and [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] who had fought for the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

In 2007, following a controversial military raid, a new group called Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]], emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Composed of various militant groups, the TTP launched an uprising aimed at ending Pakistan's efforts to control the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] tribal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The exact [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between the TTP and the Afghan Taliban]] was questioned from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. While they shared close personal, ethnic, and ideological ties, and TTP fighters participated in attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan, their agendas differed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The TTP sought to oust Pakistan from tribal areas, while the Afghan Taliban focused on expelling NATO from Afghanistan, necessitating good relations with Pakistan and elements within its security services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The conflict between Pakistan and the TTP escalated, notably in 2014, when the TTP attacked an army-run school, killing over 130 children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. After this, the TTP threat appeared to decline due to Pakistani Army operations forcing it to relocate to Eastern Pakistan and Afghanistan, and defections to groups like the Islamic State of Khorasan Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Shifting Alliances and Current Tensions

As the U.S. began to draw down its presence in Afghanistan, the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban]] gained ground, much to the anger of Pakistan's Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. In January 2018, President Trump accused Pakistan of deceit for sheltering terrorists, leading to the withholding of $900 million in security assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

However, Pakistan's support for the Afghan Taliban seemed to pay off in February 2020 when the Trump Administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban, agreeing to withdraw U.S. troops in return for pledges that Afghanistan would not become a base for anti-Western groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. In August 2021, the last U.S. and NATO forces withdrew as the Taliban swept back into Kabul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Pakistan viewed the Taliban's return to power as a victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Although Pakistan joined the rest of the world in refusing to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's new government, the Pakistani prime minister indicated his country's intention to be a link between the Taliban and the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

However, Pakistani hopes of becoming a power broker proved premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Taliban's victory in Afghanistan heralded a revival of the TTP, which intensified its attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Islamabad hoped the Taliban would control the TTP, but Kabul showed little willingness, instead organizing talks between the two sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. A ceasefire brokered by Kabul broke down in November 2022, sparking the latest wave of serious attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Border Disputes and Afghan Taliban's Independent Stance

The border issue has re-emerged as a significant point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. In early 2022, a dispute over a new fence led the Afghan information minister to explicitly raise the unresolved status of the Durand Line and its division of the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

There are other signs of a shift in the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | Pakistan-Taliban relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The Taliban regime in Kabul appears to have little need for Pakistan as an intermediary on the world stage and seems to be actively pushing back against Islamabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. For example, it has been engaging with India, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan's arch enemy]], a relationship New Delhi seems open to developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Having regained control in Afghanistan, the Taliban, or at least significant elements within it, seem content to resist Pakistan's attempts at control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Their apparent refusal to crack down on the TTP, combined with references to the contested border and a divided [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] nation, are causing concern in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This suggests that Pakistan, which nurtured the Afghan Taliban for its own ends to control Afghanistan, may now face a dramatic reversal of fortunes if the Afghan Taliban embraces its [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani offshoot]] and builds relations with India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

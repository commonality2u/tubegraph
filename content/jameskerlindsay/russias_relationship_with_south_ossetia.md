As the war in Ukraine continued, an interesting development regarding another conflict in the former Soviet Union went largely unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In May 2022, the leader of the breakaway Georgian region of [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] announced plans for a referendum on joining Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Despite appearing to be an ideal moment for Moscow to annex the territory, the vote was quickly called off due to Russian pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## De Facto States and Patron Relationships

De facto states are a fascinating aspect of contemporary international relations, having broken away from a country and achieved a degree of independence, yet they are largely or completely unrecognised by the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Facing political and economic isolation, and often under threat of invasion, these entities almost always depend on a third country, or "patron state," for diplomatic, financial, and military support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The relationship between a de facto state and its patron can be extremely complex, and their goals are not always aligned, often leading to serious tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A de facto state might seek more distance from its patron or, conversely, desire a closer relationship, even full integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

[[Russias relationship with South Ossetia | Russia's relationship with South Ossetia]], which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s, serves as one of the most interesting examples of this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This relationship came to the forefront in Spring 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## South Ossetia's Background and Division

Georgia is located in the Caucasus, bordered by Russia to its north, Azerbaijan to its east, Armenia and Turkey to its south, and a Black Sea coastline to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It is the 119th largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Since 1991, the Georgian Government has not controlled two areas: [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] is located in the north-central part of Georgia, covering about 3,900 square kilometres (1,500 square miles), which is around 5.5% of Georgia's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Its population is estimated to be between 35,000 and 40,000 people, despite official figures suggesting around 50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The Ossetians are a predominantly Christian Orthodox people living in an area straddling the Caucasus Mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Their ancestry is traced to the Alans, an ancient Iranian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Their story with Russia begins in the late 18th century when Imperial Russia started expanding into the Caucasus, conquering the northern part of the region, and by the early 19th century, taking the south along with the rest of Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

In 1917, the two parts of Ossetia were separated by the Russian Revolution; the north remained within Russia, while the south became part of a briefly independent Georgian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This division led to a series of [[History of South Ossetias independence movements | South Ossetian uprisings]] that were brutally suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In 1921, Georgia was captured by the Soviet Red Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Although the South Ossetians hoped for reunification with the north, the region was instead given self-rule as the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the new Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This arrangement persisted for seven decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Breakaway from Georgia

By the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] saw an opportunity to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. In 1989, following growing tensions with the Georgian leadership, the South Ossetian Supreme Soviet voted to unite with North Ossetia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Soviet troops prevented violent clashes, but the following year, [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] announced the formation of a separate Soviet republic and sought Moscow's recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In response, Georgian authorities rescinded its autonomy and declared a state of emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

In 1991, as [[Georgias history with Russia and territorial conflicts | Georgia regained independence]] from Soviet rule, it attempted to retake [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Despite initial gains, Georgia was unable to seize the entire region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. With fighting also escalating in [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]], which was also seeking independence, the Georgian government accepted a ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. A joint peacekeeping force was established with Russia, and peace talks began under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Renewed Tensions and the 2008 War

For the following decade, the situation remained relatively peaceful, with significant contact between [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] and Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, this changed in 2003 when the Georgian government was overthrown, and a new pro-Western president, Mikhail Saakashvili, took power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. His promise to reassert control over the breakaway regions soon led to renewed fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Although Georgia offered the region maximum possible autonomy, [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetian]] leaders called an independence referendum, which showed overwhelming support for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Over the next three to four years, tensions remained high, fueled by growing hostility between [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. In April 2008, NATO formally welcomed [[Georgias geopolitical alignment and relations with Moscow | Georgia's aspiration for membership]], a decision condemned by Moscow as a "huge strategic mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This culminated on August 7, 2008, when [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] and Georgia went to war as the world watched the Beijing Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Responding to what it claimed was an attack on its troops, Georgia ordered its forces into [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Within hours, [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russian]] soldiers and heavy armour poured through the Roki Tunnel, which links North and South Ossetia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Just five days later, after a massive [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russian]] onslaught by land, sea, and air, Georgia was forced to capitulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

Under the ceasefire agreement, [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russian]] troops withdrew from most of Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. However, [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]], comprising about 20% of Georgia's territory, remained under [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia's]] effective control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Two weeks later, Moscow announced it had recognized the two territories as independent sovereign states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. While [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia's]] independence was rejected by most of the world, four other countries (Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru, and Syria) eventually recognized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## South Ossetian Desire for Unification, Russian Hesitation

Most observers believe that [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] had little genuine interest in independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While some [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetians]] supported statehood, opinion polls indicated overwhelming support for unification with the much larger and more populous North Ossetia within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. As a result, calls for a referendum on integration grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Despite increasing economic and political ties between North and [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]], and growing [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russian]] control over [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]], Moscow steadfastly resisted calls for annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Instead, [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] appeared to prefer "creeping de facto integration" over actual unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This preference continued even after [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] annexed Crimea in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. For example, a treaty of alliance and integration signed in 2015 saw [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] guarantee [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia's]] defence and security and created a customs union, but it was explicitly framed in terms of interstate relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## The Canceled 2022 Referendum

Despite [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia's]] apparent opposition, unification remains firmly on the [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetian]] agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This was highlighted in Spring 2022, when, with international attention focused on Ukraine, [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetian]] leader Anatoly Bibilov announced plans for a referendum on union with [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Few initially took the idea seriously, viewing it as an attempt by Bibilov to shore up votes during a tough re-election campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Despite being defeated, Bibilov announced the poll would still proceed on July 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

While Georgia, the European Union, and the United States condemned the planned vote, it was more interesting to note that [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] also declared its opposition to the referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russian]] Government Spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested the Kremlin had not even been consulted about the vote and had serious concerns about its legal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. It was clear that Moscow had no intention of seeing annexation at that stage, though it did not dismiss the possibility of eventual unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

On May 31, the new [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetian]] leader, Alan Gagloyev, issued a decree cancelling the vote, leaving little doubt that Moscow had stopped the referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The statement cited legal uncertainties over the referendum question's wording and emphasized that [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] could not make unilateral decisions affecting [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia's]] interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Reasons for Cancellation

The decision to cancel the referendum appears strange given the strong support for unification with [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] within [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]], being small and isolated, has always seemed to have a weak commitment to its statehood, with a strong desire for unification with North Ossetia within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. After decades of gradual integration with [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] and North Ossetia, [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] is already effectively part of the Federation, making formal annexation seem like the obvious next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Furthermore, the timing seemed ideal due to the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. With extensive sanctions already imposed, [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] appeared to have little to lose economically or diplomatically by annexing [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. It could even have been politically useful, sending a message to the West that [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] would not bow to Western pressure, and paving the way for expected annexations of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

However, the problem evidently lies with [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. For Moscow, the matter is more complicated:
*   **Domestic Benefit**: Annexation of [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] doesn't offer much domestic benefit, as Russians lack the emotional link they have with Crimea or the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **International Costs**: It would incur wider international costs, leading to further reputational damage for seizing territory from another sovereign state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Bargaining Chip**: [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] remains a useful bargaining chip with neighboring Georgia, which has increasingly looked westward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Reintegration Difficulty**: While annexation would not be internationally recognized, in practical terms, [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russia]] would find it very difficult to leave the door open to [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia's]] eventual reintegration into Georgia, as the [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Russian]] constitution forbids the country from giving up territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Thus, gradual integration short of actual annexation represents a far better long-term option for Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This explanation, while making sense, still seems incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. It raises questions about whether Moscow truly expects to hand back [[South Ossetia and its political status | South Ossetia]] to Georgia, defying a deep-rooted Ossetian wish for unification and severing established ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Given the complexities, this moment might have seemed ideal for Moscow to resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. There appears to be more to the story, with even long-standing regional observers divided on what exactly is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This situation highlights how the surface-level relationship between de facto states and their patrons often masks a far more complex reality that is difficult for outsiders to decode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

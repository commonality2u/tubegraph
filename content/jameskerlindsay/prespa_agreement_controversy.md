The Prespa Agreement, a landmark [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | peace agreement with Greece]] signed in 2018, aimed to resolve a 30-year [[historical_background_of_north_macedonia_and_greece_name_dispute | name dispute]] involving the Republic of North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. In May 2024, a diplomatic row erupted when North Macedonia's new president insisted on using the country's old name during her inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Greek and European officials emphasized that adherence to the agreement is central to the country's future [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_EU_integration | EU integration]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Background to the Name Dispute

The Republic of North Macedonia is a landlocked country in Southeast Europe with a population of approximately 2.1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. Its neighbors include Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:16">[01:53:16]</a>. The majority of its population are ethnic Macedonians, who speak a South Slavic language, alongside a significant Albanian community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a>.

The region of Macedonia has a long history, emerging as a kingdom on the periphery of ancient Greece and expanding under Alexander the Great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:05">[02:21:05]</a>. After falling under Roman, Bulgarian, and Serb rule, it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 14th century, remaining so until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. In 1912, Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria seized Macedonia from Ottoman rule in the First Balkan War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Following disagreements, a Second Balkan War in 1913 formally partitioned Macedonia among Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:18">[03:04:18]</a>.

After World War I, Serbian-held Macedonia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:41">[03:17:41]</a>. Upon Yugoslavia's reconstitution as a socialist federation after World War II, Macedonia became one of its six constituent republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:08">[03:26:08]</a>. Yugoslav authorities fostered a distinct Macedonian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:25">[03:41:25]</a>.

### Post-Yugoslav Independence

With the collapse of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, Macedonia declared independence on December 8, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:33">[03:47:33]</a>. Greece immediately objected to the country's name, "Republic of Macedonia," arguing it claimed Greek territory and usurped historical Greek identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:05">[04:02:05]</a>. With EU support, Greece ensured that when the new country joined the UN in April 1993, it did so under the provisional name "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," or FYROM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:26">[04:24:26]</a>.

The UN initiated a process to resolve the name issue, leading to an interim agreement in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:13">[04:39:13]</a>. Macedonia agreed to change contentious symbols, and Greece promised not to obstruct its efforts to join international organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:38">[04:48:38]</a>. However, efforts to resolve the name issue failed for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:38">[04:59:38]</a>. Talks were complicated by how to describe the country's language and inhabitants, with Greece objecting to "Macedonian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:48">[05:10:48]</a>. Relations deteriorated as Athens blocked the country's NATO and EU aspirations, leading to a case before the International Court of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:14">[05:33:14]</a>. The Macedonian government further asserted ancient Greek heritage by naming its main national airport and highway after Alexander the Great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:09">[05:41:09]</a>.

## The Prespa Agreement (2018)

A breakthrough occurred in 2017 with new governments in Skopje and Greece both determined to resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:03">[05:52:03]</a>. Following intensive discussions, a deal was reached in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:14">[06:08:14]</a>:
*   **Name**: The country would be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia," to be used in all circumstances, both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:31">[06:13:31]</a>.
*   **Language**: The country's language would remain "Macedonian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:17">[06:30:17]</a>.
*   **Inhabitants**: Citizens would officially be called "citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia" but could continue to call themselves "Macedonians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:25">[06:34:25]</a>.
*   **Heritage**: The deal explicitly recognized the country's distinct Greek and Slavic heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:27">[06:44:27]</a>.

The agreement was signed on June 19, 2018, at an international ceremony on the border by Lake Prespa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:30">[06:51:30]</a>, and was widely hailed as a positive step for the two countries and the Balkan region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Controversy and Ratification

Despite international acclaim, the Prespa Agreement faced considerable opposition in both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:06">[07:12:06]</a>.
*   **North Macedonia**: It sparked widespread anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:15">[07:16:15]</a>. While Albanian political parties accepted the deal, the right-wing opposition VMRO-DPMNE rejected it as a betrayal of national identity due to outside pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:23">[07:24:23]</a>. A referendum in September 2018 failed to meet the required turnout threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:15">[07:39:15]</a>. Nevertheless, it was put to Parliament on January 11, 2019, securing 81 votes (a two-thirds majority) in the 120-member assembly amidst accusations of bribery and blackmail, allowing the necessary constitutional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:43">[07:52:43]</a>.
*   **Greece**: Many rejected the deal as an unacceptable compromise on Greek heritage and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:15">[08:15:15]</a>. However, it passed in the Greek Parliament with 153 votes in the 300-member assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:20">[08:22:20]</a>.

On February 14, 2019, the United Nations was officially informed of the name change, making the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" the "Republic of North Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:17">[08:29:17]</a>.

## Impact and Renewed Challenges

The agreement had mixed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:24">[08:43:24]</a>. It allowed North Macedonia to join NATO as its 30th member on March 27, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:09">[08:50:09]</a>. However, hopes that it would unlock EU accession were premature. While Greece dropped its veto, [[bulgaria_and_north_macedonia_eu_accession_dispute | Bulgaria now stepped in with various demands of its own]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:23">[09:00:23]</a>.

The agreement remained controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:28">[09:13:28]</a>. The main Greek opposition party, New Democracy, opposed the arrangement but took a pragmatic position when returning to power, announcing it would not challenge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:03">[09:18:03]</a>. In contrast, the main opposition in North Macedonia, VMRO-DPMNE, continued to vehemently oppose the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:26">[09:30:26]</a>.

## The Latest Crisis (May 2024)

### Presidential Inauguration
The ongoing opposition sparked the latest crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:22">[09:38:22]</a>. On May 8, 2024, North Macedonia held parliamentary and presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:30">[09:43:30]</a>. The VMRO-DPMNE won a massive victory in both, securing 58 seats in the assembly and their candidate, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, winning the largely ceremonial presidency with two-thirds of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:37">[09:50:37]</a>.

Days later, on May 12, during her swearing-in ceremony, President Siljanovska-Davkova, who had campaigned against the Prespa Agreement, refused to repeat the official oath using "Republic of North Macedonia," instead using "Republic of Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:15">[10:17:15]</a>.

### Reactions
The decision sparked an immediate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:15">[10:42:15]</a>:
*   **Greece**: The Greek Ambassador left the ceremony in protest, and the Greek foreign ministry condemned the move as a violation of the Prespa Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:22">[10:45:22]</a>.
*   **European Union**: Within hours, EU officials stressed that the country's progress towards full [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_EU_integration | European integration]] depended on adherence to the agreement with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:54">[10:55:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook

It seems unlikely that the new government will formally abandon the Prespa Agreement, as this would immediately halt any further [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_EU_integration | EU accession talks]] due to renewed Greek and other EU member opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:15">[11:22:15]</a>. The VMRO-DPMNE and the new president have stated that [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_EU_integration | EU accession]] remains a core goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:31">[11:41:31]</a>.

However, some in North Macedonia might argue that EU accession prospects are so dim that abandoning the despised agreement wouldn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:06">[11:56:06]</a>. Ultimately, the deal may be saved by internal politics, as constitutional change would require significant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:14">[12:08:14]</a>. While the new government may object to the name and question the agreement, it is unlikely to formally break the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:08">[12:19:08]</a>.

Nevertheless, the government could still undermine it by referring to "the Republic of Macedonia" in statements and documents, which would inevitably create problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:16">[12:28:16]</a>. This would go against the spirit of the agreement, potentially prompting Greece and the EU to push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. Despite hopes that the [[historical_background_of_north_macedonia_and_greece_name_dispute | Macedonian name issue]] had been settled, the dispute now appears to be back on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:09">[12:49:09]</a>.

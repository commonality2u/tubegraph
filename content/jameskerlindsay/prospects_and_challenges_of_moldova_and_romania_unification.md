The war in Ukraine has brought attention to Moldova, one of Europe's least-known countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Moldova emerged as an independent state with the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Often considered an "accidental country," there have long been calls for Moldova to unite with Romania, of which it was once a part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Romania and Moldova are considered "kin states," where a single nation is effectively divided into two separate independent and sovereign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While such states may develop distinct national identities over time, the possibility of some form of union often remains a national aspiration, either officially or within wider society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

Both Romania and Moldova are located in southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Romania**: Covers 240,000 square kilometres (over 90,000 square miles), making it the 81st largest of the 193 UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It has a population of around 19.3 million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Moldova**: Lies on Romania's eastern border, covering 34,000 square kilometres (13,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It is about a seventh of Romania's size and the 135th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Moldova's population stands at just 2.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Historical Context]]

The [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | history]] of the two countries dates back to medieval principalities like Wallachia and Moldavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   By the mid-16th century, they became Ottoman vassal states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   In 1812, Bessarabia, the eastern part of Moldavia, was ceded to Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   In 1859, Wallachia and the remaining part of Moldavia merged, eventually forming the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   Bessarabia remained outside Romanian control until it declared independence amidst the Russian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   Romania and Bessarabia were reunited at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

However, this union was brief and difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Bessarabia was largely ignored by Romania, which focused more on its newly acquired western territories like Transylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The Soviet Union never accepted this annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In June 1940, Moscow retook the region, establishing the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Even after Romania became a Soviet satellite state, Moscow kept the two territories separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Soviet authorities actively promoted a separate [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Moldovan identity]] to counter pan-Romanian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This included emphasizing language differences, reintroducing the Cyrillic script, and bringing in Russian and Ukrainian settlers to change the demographic mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Today, Ukrainians and Russians account for about seven and four percent of Moldova's population, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

With the end of the Cold War, the Republic of Moldova gained independence on December 25, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Initial talks of unification were short-lived, as divisions emerged in Moldova between those supporting union and those advocating for a separate Moldovan state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Romania subsequently aligned with the West, joining NATO in 2004 and the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | European Union]] in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In contrast, Moldova experienced years of [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | political instability]], oscillating between governments favoring closer ties with the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | European Union]] and those preferring stronger links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Prospects for Unification Today

### From Moldova's Perspective

Unification seems unlikely from Moldova's viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Limited Support**: While support for unification has grown, polling indicates only 40-45% of Moldovans desire it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **[[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Distinct Moldovan Identity]]**: A separate [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Moldovan identity]] has emerged, despite close ties with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Fear of Subordination**: There's a concern that Moldova, being small, would be a minor player in a united Romania, a view shaped by past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Moldova values its current independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Economic Benefits**: While unification might bring economic advantages, few believe it would be a complete solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Romania, though wealthier than Moldova, is not rich, with a per capita GDP about a third of the EU average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, meaning it couldn't inject vast sums into reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Existing Benefits**: Many Moldovans already gain the best advantage of any union: Romanian and, by extension, [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | EU]] citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Around a quarter of Moldova's population, including its pro-European president Maia Sandu, holds Romanian nationality, and many already live and work in the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | European Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Security Dimension**: Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised security concerns, but this is primarily driving Moldova towards [[moldovas_eu_membership_pursuit_and_its_impact | EU integration]], not unification with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Moldova, along with Ukraine and Georgia, has formally applied for [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | European Union]] membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. However, [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | NATO membership]] remains off the agenda, with neutrality enshrined in Moldova's constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### From Romania's Perspective

While there is some opinion in favor of unification, it is not as popular as often believed, with polls showing support possibly as low as 15-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Economic Cost**: Unification would be extremely expensive for Romania, which already struggles financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Political Divisions**: Moldova remains politically divided with significant support for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Demographic Concerns**: Romanians worry about the implications of admitting up to a quarter of a million ethnic Russians and importing these existing political fractures into their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Federal System**: A federal system, allowing Moldova to run its own affairs, could fulfill the aspiration for unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. However, it would offer few tangible benefits while maintaining all the disadvantages, as Romania would bear the costs without much control over Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Broader Political Questions

Beyond the attitudes within both countries, several broader political issues must be addressed:
*   **[[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | European Union]]**: It is unclear how Romania's [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | EU]] partners would react to a unification attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. While there's the precedent of German unification in the early 1990s, the situations are different, primarily because Germany was wealthy enough to fund the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Legal Issues**: A unification process would seemingly bypass the standard, lengthy [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | EU]] accession process, which is designed to ensure new entrants meet membership demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. A complex arrangement would be needed to prevent problems for the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | EU]] from Moldova's membership by unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **[[implications_of_transnistria_in_moldova_romania_relations | Transnistria]]**: This "frozen conflict" concerns a territory added to the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic by the Soviet Union, which unilaterally declared independence in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. [[implications_of_transnistrias_status_for_moldova_and_international_relations | Transnistria]] has about half a million inhabitants, a third of whom are Russian, and is supported by Moscow and propped up by approximately 1500 Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This raises serious questions about whether the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | EU]] or [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | NATO]] would be willing to inherit a new territorial issue, especially one with direct Russian involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite a body of opinion in both countries supporting unification, it appears unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. For Moldovans, it would mean giving up political independence for little obvious gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. For Romanians, while unification is spoken of, it is not a high priority given the economic and political costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Ultimately, unification may be an aspirational goal never to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

However, the two nations may find unity in another way. With Russia's war in Ukraine providing new impetus for [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | European integration]], Moldova may commit to a European pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While this process will likely be slow and the question of [[implications_of_transnistria_in_moldova_romania_relations | Transnistria]] will remain significant, there is a possibility that Romania and Moldova could one day be united within the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania | European Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

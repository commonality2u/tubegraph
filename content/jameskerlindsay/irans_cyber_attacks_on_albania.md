In July and September 2022, Iran's intelligence services orchestrated a series of destructive [[cyber_warfare_and_international_security | cyber attacks]] on Albania's critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This event led to [[diplomatic_tensions_between_iran_and_albania | diplomatic relations]] being severed between Tirana and Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, new sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and widespread condemnation from NATO members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The attacks highlighted a new era of [[cyber_warfare_and_international_security | cyber warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Changing Nature of Conflict

Traditional interstate warfare, involving conventional weaponry, is becoming less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While territorial wars can still be fought with bombs and bullets, a new mode of conflict is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. [[cyber_warfare_and_international_security | Cyber warfare]] has become a serious challenge to peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>, with potential damage often exceeding that of armed attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. For instance, a cyber attack can bring down an entire power network, whereas a missile might destroy only a single power station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

The U.S. government has described the 2022 attacks on Albania as a "troubling precedent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## An Unlikely Target

A conflict between Iran and Albania might seem unlikely due to their differing profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>.

### Iran (Islamic Republic of Iran)
*   **Location:** Between the Middle East and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:07">[02:28:07]</a>.
*   **Size:** 17th largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>.
*   **Population:** Close to 90 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>.
*   **Religion:** Predominantly Muslim, with 90-95% following the Shia branch of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Albania (Republic of Albania)
*   **Location:** Southeast Europe, three thousand kilometers from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.
*   **Size:** Ranks 140th among 193 UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:07">[02:56:07]</a>.
*   **Population:** Around 2.8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>.
*   **Religion:** Largely Muslim, following the Sunni branch of faith, but known for being highly secular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:02">[03:04:02]</a>.

## Historical Context: Iran and the MEK

The roots of this conflict trace back to the Cold War and the Iranian Revolution.

### [[Historical context of Irans international relations | Historical context of Iran's international relations]]
*   **Pre-Revolution:** Persia (Iran) became an important Western ally due to its border with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:01">[03:17:01]</a>. However, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's regime was corrupt and brutal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:04">[03:23:04]</a>, leading to growing opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Iranian Revolution (1979):** The Shah fled in January 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:02">[03:54:02]</a>, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to become Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Revolution Changes:**
    *   **Internal:** A theocratic political system was introduced, Islamic law was strictly enforced, and opposition was purged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Foreign Policy:** Long-standing ties to Israel were severed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Tensions rose with Gulf monarchies, and Iraq's decision to attack Iran in September 1980 was partly due to fears Iran intended to export its revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. This sparked an eight-year war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Relations with the West:** The US embassy in Tehran was stormed, leading to a 15-month hostage crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Iran was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1983 after being held responsible for bomb attacks on US targets in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. In 2002, President George W. Bush called Iran part of an "Axis of Evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK)
*   **Origins:** Emerged in the mid-1960s as opposition to the Shah, drawing on militant Islam, radical Marxism, and anti-Americanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. They even attacked US citizens in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Revolution:** Relations with the new Iranian regime collapsed, leading to thousands of members being rounded up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. The leadership fled to France, then to Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **In Iraq:** Iraq welcomed MEK during the Iran-Iraq War, providing Camp Ashraf, a large military base 65 kilometers from the Iranian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. After the war, MEK continued its campaign against Iran and helped Iraqi forces suppress [[iran_and_iraq_pressures_on_kurdistan | Kurdish insurgents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Terrorist Designation:** Washington and other Western states listed MEK as a terrorist organization by the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   **US Invasion of Iraq (2003):** The Bush Administration saw MEK as a tool to undermine Iran, granting it formal US protection despite its terrorist designation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. However, as Iraq transitioned to a new administration with ties to Iran, MEK came under attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
*   **Relocation to Albania:** Washington revoked MEK's terrorist designation and sought to relocate the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Albania, staunchly pro-American due to Washington's support for [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] independence from Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a> and a NATO member since 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, agreed to accept MEK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Thousands of MEK members were airlifted to Albania between 2014 and 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, establishing a new base near the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Shift to Online Insurgency:** Unable to maintain an armed insurgency, MEK switched tactics, setting up "troll farms" to lead an online campaign against the Iranian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. This is believed to have sparked Iran's cyber attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## The Cyber Attacks

Planning for the cyber attacks began in early 2021 with Iran infiltrating Albanian government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Significant reconnaissance occurred in May and June 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

### July 2022 Attack
On July 15, a group named "Homeland Justice," identified as an Iranian state cyber actor, launched a ransomware attack that included anti-MEK messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. As Albanian authorities responded, a wave of destructive malware was unleashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

**Impact:**
*   Widespread disruption across government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   Affected critical government services, medical appointments, and school databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   Shut down websites for the Prime Minister's office and Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   Government's main online portal "e-Albania" was shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

### September 2022 Attack
Another attack occurred in September, targeting the police computer network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This brought down border control systems, causing large queues at entry and crossing points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Response and Implications

### Albania's Response
Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama revealed the full extent of the attacks, directly blaming the Islamic Republic of Iran and calling it an act of State aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. In response, Albania's Council of Ministers decided to [[diplomatic_tensions_between_iran_and_albania | sever diplomatic relations]] with Iran immediately and expel all Iranian diplomats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Iran vigorously denied the allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

### International Response
*   **United States:** The White House condemned the attacks as a "troubling precedent for cyberspace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions against the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and its minister for "malign cyber activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.
*   **NATO:** NATO Partners strongly condemned the attacks against an ally and pledged to support Albania's efforts to strengthen its [[cyber_warfare_and_international_security | cyber defense]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. However, Albania did not refer the matter to NATO under Article 5 (collective defense), as Prime Minister Rama did not wish to escalate the matter further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

### Broader Implications
The incident raises significant questions about [[cyber_warfare_and_international_security | cyber warfare]] and appropriate responses to such attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Currently, preferred reactions include low-key condemnation, sanctions, and potentially cyber retaliation, with little appetite for conventional counter-attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. This raises concerns about whether states feel they can cause widespread disruption with relative impunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

The attack also highlights the implications of supporting dissident groups in the contemporary era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. Albania was attacked for providing sanctuary to MEK, a group with a history of conventional and online insurgency against Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. This fits a historical pattern of states retaliating against countries that allow their territory to be used by insurgencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. While some argue Albania is right to host MEK given Iran's history of sponsoring terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>, such support carries significant risks, even at a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Iran's [[cyber_warfare_and_international_security | cyber attack]] on Albania, though receiving limited international attention, poses profoundly important questions about the evolution of conflict in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

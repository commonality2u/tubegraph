From: [[jameskerlindsay]] <br/> 

The United States is currently engaged in crucial negotiations to renew several key agreements with three small Pacific countries: the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These talks, though receiving little attention, are vital for securing U.S. national security interests and preserving international peace and stability for decades to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The discussions are proving more difficult than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Concept of Free Association

The modern international system is founded on the principle of independent sovereign states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, 'free association' is a concept that blurs these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Originally developed to aid decolonization, it allows territories full internal self-government while an outside state manages aspects of their defense and foreign affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Currently, there are five examples of this arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
*   The Cook Islands and Niue, associated with New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   The Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau, associated with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

These special relationships between Washington and the three Pacific countries are now at risk as fundamental parts of their agreements come up for renegotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### The Freely Associated States (FAS)

The Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau stretch across the eastern Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Comprising over 2,000 small islands, their combined land area is only 1,350 square kilometers (520 square miles), making them the 171st largest member of the United Nations if combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, their wider maritime boundaries cover approximately 5.6 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles), giving them the world's seventh-largest exclusive economic zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Their total population is just over 175,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>:
*   Micronesia: Approximately 113,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Marshall Islands: 46,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Palau: 18,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Their economies rely on subsistence farming, fishing, and tourism, and all three are highly dependent on U.S. aid and grants, which can account for up to a third of their annual budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## [[history_and_geopolitical_context_of_pacific_islands | Historical Context]]

The [[history_and_geopolitical_context_of_pacific_islands | history]] of these islands dates back thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Colonial Periods
*   **Spanish Control (16th Century - 1898):** Spain expanded into Southeast Asia and the Pacific, eventually including the Caroline, Marshall, Palau, and Mariana Islands (which also incorporated Guam) as part of the Spanish East Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **German Control (1880s - 1920):** Spain passed the Marshall Islands to German control in the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. After losing the Philippines and Guam to the U.S. in 1898, Madrid sold its remaining Pacific territories to Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Imperial Japan (1920 - WWII):** Following World War I, the League of Nations transferred control of the islands to Imperial Japan in December 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **U.S. Control (WWII - Decolonization):** U.S. forces seized the island chains during World War II, often after brutal fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### United States Trusteeship
After World War II, the United Nations Trusteeship Council was tasked with overseeing decolonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In April 1947, the UN Security Council designated the United States as the administering authority of what became the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

!> **U.S. Nuclear Testing**
During the late 1940s and 1950s, the Marshall Islands became a prominent site for U.S. nuclear weapons testing, starting with explosions on Bikini Atoll in July 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Over 12 years, 67 tests were conducted, leading to catastrophic environmental and health impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

As decolonization accelerated globally, pressure grew on the U.S. to relinquish control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. In the 1970s, Washington offered the islands a choice between formal integration or independence under free association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

*   In 1975, the Northern Mariana Islands voted to retain ties, becoming a commonwealth and one of five unincorporated U.S. territories alongside Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   The remaining districts opted for free association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Four merged to form the Federated States of Micronesia in May 1979, while the Marshall Islands and Palau rejected membership, becoming separate self-governing republics in 1979 and 1981, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Compacts of Free Association (COFA)

By 1984, the U.S. and the islands agreed on the terms of their future relationships under the "Compacts of Free Association" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Under the COFA:
*   The territories would be self-governing states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   They would have the right to conduct their own foreign affairs, including signing treaties, in consultation with Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   Their citizens would have the right to live and work in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   In return, the U.S. would assume full authority and responsibility for their security and defense, including the right to block other states from military access (known as the 'right of strategic denial') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   The U.S. would also provide significant financial assistance for 15 years and allow participation in certain federal economic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The compacts were subject to regular review and could be terminated by mutual consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. After referendums and U.S. Congressional approval, the compacts with the Marshall Islands and Micronesia came into force in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Although the U.S. recognized them as independent states, the Soviet Union blocked their formal UN approval until the end of the Cold War, with both becoming full UN members in September 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Palau's compact was ratified later, and it became a UN member in December 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Importance of the FAS to the United States

The Freely Associated States have served as useful, though minor, partners for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. They provide:
*   U.S. control over a significant part of the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   Military facilities, including an important ballistic missile test site in the Marshall Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Useful diplomatic cover for Washington on contentious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

In 2003 and 2004, Congress extended the financial assistance elements of the compacts for another 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, amounting to an estimated $229 million for Palau, $1 billion for the Marshall Islands, and $2.1 billion for Micronesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. These financial agreements are now up for renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Current Renegotiations and Challenges

The renegotiation of financial assistance provisions began in August 2019, initiated by then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. However, the process has been tougher than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Key issues in the talks include:
*   Agreeing on the terms and levels of funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Requests from all three countries for assistance to manage the effects of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   The Marshall Islands seeking further compensation for the nuclear tests conducted in the 1940s and 1950s, which Washington is resisting, having already paid half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### The [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | Chinese Factor]]

A major complicating factor is [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China's increasing economic, political, and strategic influence across the Pacific region]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Concerns for the U.S.:** If talks fail, there are fears that the Freely Associated States may be tempted to engage more actively with China, reducing U.S. influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Taiwan Recognition:** This could lead the Marshall Islands and Palau, two of the remaining 13 UN members recognizing Taiwan, to switch recognition to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Loss of 'Strategic Denial':** Most seriously, a complete termination of the compacts, though currently not indicated, would strip Washington of its 'right of strategic denial', a potential barrier against Beijing's wider military ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

The U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific region openly acknowledges the value of these relationships, calling the Freely Associated States "the Bedrock of the U.S role in the Pacific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### U.S. Response and Ongoing Efforts
Despite a slow start to the talks, partly due to the pandemic, there has been a growing sense of urgency in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   In March 2022, the Biden Administration appointed a Special Presidential Envoy for the negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   Congress has also called for the negotiations to be prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | Chinese efforts]] to win over the region, such as Beijing's call for a major new security relationship with 10 Pacific Island States in May 2022, have underscored the importance of a new deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This initiative, despite financial incentives, was blocked by Micronesia, which termed it "a threat to regional stability," highlighting its continued value to Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   Washington has increased its own efforts, hosting the first-ever Summit with Pacific island leaders in late September 2022, attended by President Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Blinken also participated in the latest round of compact negotiations with the presidents of the three countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Despite these efforts, a final agreement has yet to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The year 2023 is seen as vital for the U.S. to preserve its unique relationship with these three Pacific States, which are central to its strategy to counter growing [[chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | Chinese strategic influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Since November 2024, large-scale [[serbian_student_protests_and_their_impact | student protests]] have occurred in Serbia, leading to several high-profile resignations, including the Prime Minister, and raising questions about the stability of the government and the position of long-standing President Aleksandar Vučić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Historical Context

Serbia is a landlocked country in Southeastern Europe, situated at the crossroads of Central Europe and the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its capital, Belgrade, is one of Europe's oldest cities and serves as a key hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The country's population is approximately 6.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Historically, Serbia was a kingdom in medieval times before being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It gradually regained autonomy in the 19th century, achieving full independence in 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. After World War I, Serbia was central to the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later known as Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Following World War II, it became a republic within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Post-Yugoslavia [[history_of_political_instability_in_serbia | Political Instability]]

The death of Josip Broz Tito in May 1980 led to the federation's steady fracture due to economic difficulties and intensifying nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Slobodan Milošević rose to prominence as a champion of Serbian nationalism, becoming Serbia's president in 1989 after a series of mass protests known as the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. His actions deepened ethnic divisions, accelerating the collapse of Yugoslavia, which began with Slovenia and Croatia declaring independence in 1991, leading to the Yugoslav Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

International sanctions were imposed on Serbia due to Milošević's role in inciting and prolonging the wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Despite economic collapse and growing dissent, he strengthened his grip on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Opposition grew, especially after NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 following fighting in [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. In 2000, Milošević was forced from power by mass protests after refusing to concede a presidential election defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He was extradited to The Hague to face war crimes charges but died in 2006 before a verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

In the years following Milošević's downfall, Serbia struggled with [[history_of_political_instability_in_serbia | political instability]] despite moving towards democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. A low point occurred in 2003 with the assassination of pro-European Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While European integration continued, nationalist parties like the Serbian Radical Party maintained considerable popular support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Aleksandar Vučić's Dominance

Towards the end of the 2000s, disillusionment with the Democratic Party grew due to a lack of tangible results despite promoting reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. While nationalist sentiment intensified after [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]] declared independence in February 2008, many also tired of the radicals' extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This paved the way for Aleksandar Vučić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Vučić, who had served as Milošević's Minister for Information and had a reputation as a staunch nationalist, rebranded himself as a pro-European reformer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. In early 2008, he co-founded the Serbian Progressive Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. His political career ascended rapidly:
*   Served as Deputy Prime Minister from 2012 to 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Became Prime Minister after the Progressives' overwhelming victory in the 2014 general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   Secured another significant win in the 2016 early elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Was elected president in 2017, becoming the undisputed power in the country, even though the prime minister typically handles domestic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Secured a second five-year presidential term in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Over the past decade, Aleksandar Vučić has come to completely dominate the Serbian political scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Criticisms of Vučić's Administration

While supporters credit Vučić's administration with significant economic growth and major infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, and increased foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, opponents argue that he has overseen a steady rolling back of democratic freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Accusations include:
*   Suppressing the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   Manipulating elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   Using state resources and political patronage to bolster his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
*   Overseeing rampant corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Causing significant environmental damage through projects like a waterfront development in Belgrade and proposed lithium mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>

Opposition parties claim that international partners, including the European Union and the United States, have supported the administration by prioritizing stability over democracy, leading them to believe they can no longer work through normal democratic channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This has resulted in frequent mass protests over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## The Current Protests

The latest [[serbian_student_protests_and_their_impact | protests]] began after a tragic incident on November 1, 2024, when the newly reconstructed canopy at Novi Sad railway station collapsed, killing 15 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Many immediately attributed the tragedy to corruption, blaming poor workmanship by the Chinese consortium and inadequate safety inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Although the incident led to the transport minister's resignation and the arrest of over a dozen officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, it was widely seen as symbolic of deep-rooted mismanagement within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Student groups began demonstrating, demanding justice, greater transparency, and increased government spending on infrastructure and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Despite attempts to suppress them, the [[serbian_student_protests_and_their_impact | protests]] spread across the country, attracting other groups like farmers, academics, and lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. In January 2025, thousands of students marched 80 km from Novi Sad to Belgrade, blocking key highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Tens of thousands continue to rally, marking the most significant unrest in Serbia since the fall of Milošević <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Outlook for the Government

The ongoing unrest raises questions about the future of the government and President Vučić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Challenges for the Protesters

Currently, the students are not explicitly trying to overthrow the government and are avoiding direct engagement with opposition parties, focusing instead on deeper changes to the Serbian political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

President Vučić remains defiant, arguing the [[serbian_student_protests_and_their_impact | protests]] are not a reflection of popular will but are stirred up by foreign forces seeking to undermine Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. His supporters believe he enjoys significant national popularity beyond urban centers like Belgrade and Novi Sad, crediting him with economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The lack of a coherent and credible opposition, which is weak and fractured, also helps Vučić's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Signs of Government Concern

Despite the president's defiance, the administration appears concerned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Concessions have been made, highlighted by the resignation of Serbian Prime Minister Miloš Vučević, a former mayor of Novi Sad, on January 28, along with Novi Sad's current mayor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Evidence suggests the [[serbian_student_protests_and_their_impact | protests]] are growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Past experience in Serbia demonstrates that widespread popular protest can force leaders from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This provides an incentive for protesters seeking to overthrow the administration to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

The current situation appears to be a "battle of wills" regarding how much more traction the [[serbian_student_protests_and_their_impact | protests]] can gain and how long their momentum can last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. If demonstrations continue to grow and spread, pressure could become overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Additionally, if serious violence erupts, especially if provoked by the government, the situation could quickly escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. While Vučić has experience handling widespread protests and his position may seem secure for now, history shows that such pressure is bearable "until it isn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

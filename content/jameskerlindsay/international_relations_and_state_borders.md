The current era is witnessing challenges to many long-standing rules of [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]], particularly the principle that state borders are sacrosanct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The modern international system is founded on the principle that countries will respect each other's territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This principle has largely held true since 1945, with few wars of conquest across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas over the past 80 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

However, this understanding is now being challenged as never before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Alongside Russia's invasion of Ukraine, increasing threats from Donald Trump against Canada, Panama, and NATO ally Denmark over Greenland highlight this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Greenland: A Case Study in Border Disputes

Donald Trump's interest in seizing Greenland has caused an international stir, as he explicitly refused to rule out using military force to take control of the Danish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He views Greenland as vital to US security interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Geography and Demographics
Greenland, located between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, is the world's largest island, covering 2.2 million square kilometers (840,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Its western edge is just 26 km (16 miles) from Canada's Ellesmere Island, and Iceland is 740 km (460 miles) to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The island has a population of around 56,000, with about 80% of the country covered in ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Most inhabitants live along the coastal regions, including the capital, Nuuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Nearly 90% of the population is of native Inuit origin, with the remaining 10% being Danish or mixed heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Historical Background
Greenland's history dates back approximately 4,500 years with the arrival of the first settlers from North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. These original inhabitants survived until the 11th century when the ancestors of the modern Inuit population arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Norse settlers from Iceland also arrived around this time but disappeared by the 15th century due to climate conditions and conflict with the Inuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Danish involvement began in the early 18th century, leading to Greenland becoming part of the joint state of Denmark-Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. When the union ended in 1814 under the Treaty of Kiel, Denmark retained control over Greenland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

During the Second World War, following Denmark's fall to Nazi Germany in 1941, the United States oversaw the territory for several years and established an important airbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Although Denmark regained control after the war, the US base remained, serving as a crucial intelligence, early warning, and refueling facility throughout the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

In 1953, Greenland's colonial status was abolished, and it became a Danish province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. It was granted self-rule in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, and in 2009, local power was expanded, allowing Greenlanders to control most aspects of their governance, including health, education, natural resources, and the local economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Denmark continues to manage foreign affairs, security, and defense, providing approximately a fifth of Greenland's income through a yearly grant of about half a billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The islanders have their own political institutions, including a prime minister, executive, and parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Independence Debate and Geopolitical Significance
Despite close ties with Denmark, there have been growing calls for independence in recent years, with many seeing it as time for Greenland to become a separate sovereign state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. However, concerns about Greenland's viability as a fully independent country exist due to its small population and economic reliance on Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, making independence a longer-term goal rather than an immediate priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

The debate has shifted recently due to broader geopolitical developments and environmental factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Global warming and melting Arctic ice are making Greenland an increasingly significant point for new shipping routes and are making previously hard-to-reach resources more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It is against this backdrop that Trump turned his attention to Greenland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Trump's Interest and International Reactions
In December 2024, President-elect Trump stated on social media that the United States considered ownership and control of Greenland essential for its national security and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This is not a new idea; Trump previously proposed purchasing Greenland in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, a suggestion dismissed as "absurd" by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, leading to Trump canceling a planned state visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Although officials from Denmark and Greenland have again rejected Trump's calls, insisting the territory is not for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, fears persist that something more dangerous may be at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. In January 2025, Trump explicitly refused to rule out military action to seize Greenland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Observers note that Trump's comments now appear to have a more serious and calculated intent, driven by genuine security concerns over Greenland's status in the changing geopolitical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Greenland is seen as vital for reigning in Russian and Chinese activities in the Arctic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This perceived seriousness has led to strong international responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Denmark has firmly rejected the claims and increased its defense commitment to Greenland, though it acknowledges this is insufficient to ward off any US attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Key European partners, such as France and Germany, have insisted that Greenland is subject to the European Union's mutual defense provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, EU officials have been cautious about what the Union would actually do if Trump acted on his threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Potential Scenarios for Acquisition

**Peaceful Acquisition (Purchase)**
The most obvious route for the US to acquire Greenland would be peacefully, perhaps by purchasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, Denmark cannot simply sell it; the decision would require Greenland's approval, likely involving promises of significant public spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. If acquired, Greenland's exact status would need to be determined, as full federal statehood would be unlikely due to its tiny population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. It would more likely have a status similar to Puerto Rico or other US overseas territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Many might view Greenland's current relationship with Denmark as better in the long run than being under US control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

**Military Action (Invasion)**
If peaceful efforts fail and Trump pursues an invasion, the diplomatic and political implications would be immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. An attack on Greenland would be a direct strike against a NATO ally, creating an unprecedented crisis within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. While NATO members have had tensions, this would be the first formal attempt by one member to seize territory from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

It is inconceivable that Denmark's EU partners would respond militarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Instead, they would likely pursue strong diplomatic, political, and economic measures, such as imposing sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This could lead to US retaliation and a fundamental breakdown of Western relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Trump might even use the opportunity to withdraw the United States from NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Consequences of Normalizing Border Threats
While a worst-case scenario, Trump's statements are considered extremely dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. They normalize the idea that states can threaten to use force to seize territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This will have worrying knock-on effects, potentially returning [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]] to a "might-is-right" power politics era marked by regular wars if countries like Russia and the United States freely talk about seizing land from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Alternative: Free Association
An option acceptable to all parties could be the concept of free association within [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This allows small independent states to develop a formal relationship with a larger country, which would oversee their foreign and defense policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The United States already has such agreements with the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, all separate UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

This could be an option for Greenland, potentially even in conjunction with Denmark, creating a unique hybrid model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This approach would give Greenland the independence many desire, the security and support it would still need, and direct US control over important aspects of security and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The key question remains whether this would satisfy Trump's ambition, or if his true aim is complete US control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

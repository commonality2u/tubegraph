Historically, Ireland has maintained a strong commitment to [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] and has avoided joining NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, there are emerging indications that this stance is shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and increasing Russian naval activity near its coast, there's a growing recognition that Ireland's broader political, security, and strategic environment is undergoing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | war in Ukraine]] has sparked a wide-ranging [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | debate across Europe about neutrality and NATO membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Ireland's Historical Neutrality

For most of its history, Ireland has maintained an official policy of [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | military neutrality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This policy has become deeply intertwined with the national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The foundation of Irish neutrality dates back to its efforts to distance itself from Britain and limit involvement in foreign conflicts after becoming the Irish Free State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The constitution explicitly required parliamentary approval for war involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This commitment was reiterated when Ireland became a republic in 1937, emphasizing cooperation between states and peaceful dispute settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Formal neutrality was first proclaimed at the start of the Second World War when Ireland refused to join the Allied forces against Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. While controversial, Ireland leaned towards the Allies, cracking down on anti-British activities, sharing intelligence, and contributing personnel to the British armed forces and war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

After World War II and the onset of the Cold War, Ireland, now a fully sovereign state, was invited by the United States to join NATO in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Ireland refused due to the unacceptable prospect of a formal military alliance with the United Kingdom, which still occupied a part of its constitutionally claimed territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Thus, neutrality was maintained more out of political realities than ideological conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>; it has never been formally written into the Irish Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Despite its non-alignment, Ireland developed a strong international reputation as a contributor to [[irelands_participation_in_international_security_and_peacekeeping | UN peacekeeping missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, sending troops to global hotspots like Congo, Cyprus, and Lebanon over 60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

By the 1990s, the context for Irish neutrality shifted significantly. Relations with the UK improved following Ireland's entry into the European Communities in 1973 alongside Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, and especially with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The end of the Cold War also played a role, with Ireland joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. However, neutrality remained deeply ingrained in Irish thought. In 2009, during the signing of the Lisbon Treaty, Ireland insisted on a protocol to explicitly reaffirm that the treaty did not affect its traditional military neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Impact of the War in Ukraine

The [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | war in Ukraine]] has profoundly challenged Ireland's long-held neutral stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Ireland's Response to the Conflict

*   **Strong Support for Ukraine**: Ireland has openly and unequivocally supported Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. While militarily neutral, Ireland emphasizes that this does not equate to political neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Actions Against Russia**: Dublin has strongly condemned Russia's invasion and supported key measures against Moscow, including EU sanctions and expelling Russia from the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Military Aid and Training**: Ireland has provided Ukraine with â‚¬55 million in non-lethal military aid as part of a wider coordinated EU contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. It has also agreed to train Ukrainian forces, though in another EU member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Many argue these actions push the concept of military neutrality to its limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Shifting Strategic Environment

*   **Russian Naval Activity**: Growing Russian naval activity around Irish waters is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Strategic Importance**: Despite its peripheral location, Ireland's strategic position is becoming more crucial, especially given the many vital undersea communications cables running from Ireland to North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **NATO Project Consideration**: With fears of Russian attacks on these cables in retaliation for Western support for Ukraine, the Irish government is reportedly considering joining a NATO project to protect this critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Government Stance**: These developments have led to calls for Ireland to abandon its [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] and join NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. While the government hasn't officially endorsed this, it is keeping its options open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Governing parties have rejected a proposal to codify neutrality into the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, and the EU affairs minister explicitly stated the Russian invasion was forcing a reconsideration of neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. A public consultation on the country's defense orientation is underway, indicating serious consideration of a fundamental change to Ireland's strategic position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Arguments for and Against Changing Neutrality

The [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | debate about Ireland's military neutrality]] is dynamic, with strong arguments on both sides.

### Arguments for Maintaining Neutrality

*   **Existential Argument**: Neutrality is seen as a fundamental, almost sacred, part of Irish identity, defining its role on the world stage, especially as a UN peacekeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Abandoning it, proponents argue, would diminish this standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Pragmatic Arguments**:
    *   No pressing need to abandon neutrality as no one is pressuring Ireland to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   Ireland is already effectively protected by NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
    *   Other neutral countries like Austria show no signs of changing their stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Ireland has one of the lowest defense expenditures in the EU, at just 0.3% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Joining NATO would require a significant increase to the expected 2% of GDP, which many view as an unacceptable diversion of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Northern Ireland**: Despite progress, many still find it inconceivable for Ireland to formally ally with a country that occupies Irish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Arguments for Abandoning Neutrality

*   **Peacekeeping and Mediation**: Critics of the existential argument point to Norway, a NATO member, as a successful mediator in world politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **"Freeloading"**: Critics argue Ireland's current position amounts to freeloading, benefiting from a broader European defense umbrella without contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Increased Defense Spending**: Regardless of its stance on neutrality, there's a growing sense that Ireland will need to increase defense spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The government has already announced the largest increase in defense spending in the country's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Northern Ireland Argument Challenged**: The historical basis for neutrality regarding Northern Ireland has been challenged by a recent revelation of a secret 1950s agreement where Britain provided Ireland with air security for 70 years, a report the Irish government neither confirms nor denies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This, combined with guaranteed defense from Britain, the European Union, and the United States in the event of an attack, leads many to argue it's time for Ireland to accept reality and join NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Future Outlook

The outcome of this [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | debate on Ireland joining NATO]] remains uncertain, with polling data being mixed and contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. An April 2022 poll showed 70% support for sanctions on Russia, yet two-thirds wanted to maintain neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Another poll showed a more even split, with 52% favoring NATO membership versus 48% against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. A referendum on the issue, which would almost certainly be required, could go either way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Even if full NATO membership is deemed too significant a step, other options exist:
*   Closer cooperation with NATO, short of full membership, might be an acceptable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Ireland could abandon formal neutrality and become more integrated into European Union defense structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

Ultimately, the ongoing discussions in Ireland highlight how the [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | Ukraine war]] has profoundly influenced European and International Security debates, forcing many countries to reassess long-held views about their global role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

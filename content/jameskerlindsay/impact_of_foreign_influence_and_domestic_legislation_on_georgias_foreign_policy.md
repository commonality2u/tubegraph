Georgia's geopolitical alignment has become increasingly complex, with recent events raising questions about its orientation towards Moscow despite significant parts of the country remaining under Russian occupation and the government openly supporting European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many established patterns of [[impact_on_international_relations | international relations]] have been challenged, leading to unexpected changes in alignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Historical Context and Early Independence
Georgia is located in the Caucasus, bordered by Russia to the north, Azerbaijan to the southeast, and Armenia and Turkey to the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Its total area is approximately 70,000 square kilometers, with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, making up about 20% of its territory, having unilaterally declared independence, recognized only by Russia and a few other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

[[georgias_history_with_russia_and_territorial_conflicts | Georgia's history]] includes a unified kingdom in the Middle Ages, which ended with the [[mongolias_foreign_policy_and_international_relations | Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. In 1783, one Georgian kingdom sought protection from Imperial Russia, leading to its annexation within 30 years and the Georgian people coming under Russian control by the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Following the collapse of Tsarist Russia in 1917, Georgia formed the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic before declaring independence as the Democratic Republic of Georgia on May 26, 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This lasted three years until the Red Army invaded in February 1921, incorporating Georgia into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Georgia regained independence on April 9, 1991, after nationalist protests in 1989 were suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It was admitted to the United Nations in July 1992 and initially joined the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Early challenges included a civil war and attempts by South Ossetia and Abkhazia to break away, leading to violent clashes and Kremlin-brokered ceasefires policed by Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These events severely strained relations between Moscow and Tbilisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Saakashvili Era: Pro-Western Shift and 2008 War
In 2003, the Rose Revolution peacefully overthrew President Eduard Shevardnadze, due to unresolved issues with breakaway territories, economic problems, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Mikheil Saakashvili, a pro-Western lawyer, became president, promising reforms and vowing to move Georgia closer to the European Union and NATO, which led to a sharp deterioration in relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

In August 2008, a short but brutal war erupted between Georgia and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Russia scored a decisive victory, and in retaliation for the West's recognition of [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo's declaration of independence]] from Serbia, Russia recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The conflict marked a decisive break in relations, with Tbilisi cutting diplomatic ties to Moscow and withdrawing from the CIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This also damaged Saakashvili's standing amid accusations of recklessly stirring tensions and his administration becoming increasingly authoritarian, facing allegations of corruption and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Georgian Dream Era: Balancing Act and Rising Concerns
In 2012, Saakashvili's party was defeated by the Georgian Dream coalition, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who had made his fortune in post-Soviet Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Despite Ivanishvili's background, the new government maintained Georgia's pro-Western orientation, signing an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014 and opening a joint training center with NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

However, the Georgian Dream administration took a more conciliatory approach towards Russia, arguing that avoiding antagonism and re-establishing working ties were necessary for regaining lost territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Efforts began to normalize relations by focusing on trade, travel, and humanitarian cooperation, while avoiding steps that would inflame tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. For example, while Georgia condemned Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, it refused to impose sanctions against Russia, unlike EU and NATO states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Accusations of Pro-Russian Sentiment and Democratic Backsliding
The government's approach led to opposition accusations of pro-Russian sentiment, culminating in [[antigovernment_protests_in_georgia_and_domestic_political_issues | mass demonstrations]] in June 2019 after a Russian lawmaker visited the Georgian Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Observers noted parallels with developments in Putin's Russia, particularly concerns about the government's domestic political record, including allegations of backsliding on democratic principles, judicial independence, and media freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This was reportedly fueled by growing Russian disinformation aimed at encouraging extremism and anti-Western messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Impact of the Ukraine War
With Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Georgians instinctively supported Ukraine, seeing parallels with their own situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The Georgian government condemned the attack, accused Russia of undermining international order, and voted in favor of UN resolutions against Moscow, yet still refused to impose sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Concerns about Georgia's orientation were seemingly allayed when it applied to join the European Union alongside Moldova and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, unlike the other two, Georgia was given 12 priorities to address, including democratic reforms, improving the rule of law, and countering foreign disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### The "Foreign Agents" Law and EU Candidacy
Concern grew when the government introduced controversial legislation requiring any organization receiving over 20% of its income from an external source to register as an agent of foreign influence, mirroring similar Russian legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Facing significant internal opposition and criticism from the EU and the United States, the government initially dropped the plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. In December 2023, Georgia was formally granted EU candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

However, just months later, the government reintroduced the foreign agents legislation, sparking outrage and [[antigovernment_protests_in_georgia_and_domestic_political_issues | mass demonstrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Despite strong criticism from the EU and United States, warning of serious consequences, the government refused to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. On May 28, it overrode a presidential veto and passed the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

While the government denies accusations of being under Moscow's influence, its rhetoric has taken a distinctly pro-Russian turn, embracing conspiracy theories and Kremlin disinformation talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Ivanishvili, the effective leader of Georgian Dream, has accused a "Global War Party" of instigating the Ukraine conflict and even forcing Georgia and Russia to war in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Analysis of Current Trends
The current situation is complex and open to interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. While developments may indicate a drift towards Moscow, another explanation is that the government is trying to strengthen its position before parliamentary elections later in the year, as it enjoys relatively little public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The "foreign agents" law and new anti-LGBT legislation are seen as attempts to hinder the opposition and shore up its base, playing well among older, socially conservative voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

This strategy directly counters the demands of Georgia's Western partners, creating a serious problem given that support for EU membership in Georgia runs as high as 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The government risks losing power unless it can reduce support for EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Even if the government is not overtly pro-Russian, its pushback against the EU for internal survival provides Moscow with an ideal opportunity to exert influence, as Russia does not condition its support on the rule of law or democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. While pursuing closer ties to Moscow might seem unrealistic given the Russian occupation of parts of the country, the existence of substantial pro-Russian support in Moldova, despite its own occupied territory, shows such a scenario is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

Moscow doesn't necessarily need a complete Georgian realignment; it simply needs to divide society enough to reduce Western influence and high levels of support for Euro-Atlantic integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This increasingly seems to align with the Georgian government's practical needs, suggesting a steady convergence of the ultimate aims of Russia and the Georgian Dream party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Future Outlook
As Georgia heads towards pivotal elections, President Salome Zourabichvili is leading efforts to challenge the government, presenting the elections as a chance to restore Georgia's European path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. With the government seemingly moving in a different direction, the coming months are expected to determine Georgia's future orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

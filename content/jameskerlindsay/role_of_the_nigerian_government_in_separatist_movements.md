The Nigerian government has played a significant and often controversial role in the emergence, suppression, and resurgence of separatist movements within the country, most notably the [[biafran_independence_movement|Biafran independence movement]].

### Historical Context and Early Responses

Nigeria officially gained independence in 1960, having been formally constituted as a federation of three regions in 1954, which were roughly aligned with the main ethnic groups: the Hausa-Fulani in the North, Yoruba in the West, and Igbo in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>. The earlier British colonial administration had merged two distinct protectorates – the Northern Nigerian Protectorate and the Southern Nigerian Protectorate – in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:16">[02:29:16]</a>.

Tensions soon emerged after independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:51">[03:02:51]</a>. Following disputed elections, a military coup in January 1966 led to the assassination of many leading political figures, including the popular premier of the Northern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:17">[03:04:17]</a>. In response, thousands of ethnic Igbo living in the north were murdered, causing over a million others to flee south to the Eastern Region, which in turn prompted calls for the territory to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>.

Although a deal for a looser federal arrangement was purportedly reached between the Eastern leadership and the federal government in early 1967, the federal government appeared to renege on this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:46">[03:30:46]</a>. It announced a plan to divide the country's three regions into 12 new parts, which was perceived as a deliberate attempt to undermine the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. This action directly preceded Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu's declaration of Biafran independence on May 30, 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:21">[03:45:21]</a>.

### The Biafran War (1967-1970)

The Nigerian government responded to the secessionist declaration by launching a full-scale invasion just under six weeks later to put down the uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:18">[03:55:18]</a>. This led to the [[nigerian_civil_war | Biafran War]] (also known as the Nigerian Civil War), which became a humanitarian catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:21">[04:01:21]</a>. The government's actions, including cutting off supplies to the breakaway region, resulted in an estimated one to three million deaths from hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:37">[04:07:37]</a>.

The Nigerian government, supported by key international allies including Britain and the Soviet Union, eventually defeated the last pockets of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:11">[04:16:11]</a>. On January 15, 1970, the Republic of Biafra ceased to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:24">[04:26:24]</a>.

### Post-Conflict Policies and Perceived Failures

In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the Federal Government, under General Yakubu Gowon, called for national unity, famously declaring "no victors and no vanquished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:16">[04:32:16]</a>. This led to a policy centered on the "Three R's": reintegration, reconciliation, and reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:26">[04:44:26]</a>. The scale of the defeat and traumatic memories of war initially kept Igbo independence sentiment in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:13">[04:52:13]</a>.

However, by the late 1990s, separatist sentiment began to resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:10">[05:00:10]</a>. Many felt that despite the official "Three R's" policy, the Igbo continued to face hostility and discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:12">[05:16:12]</a>.

The government's actions (or inactions) contributed to this resurgence:
*   **Exclusion and Discrimination**: Igbo, despite being one of the three main groups, were systematically shut out of key jobs and the highest political offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:26">[05:24:26]</a>.
*   **Economic Neglect**: Many argued that the government deliberately neglected economic development in the region, providing lower levels of federal funding and few infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:20">[05:32:20]</a>.
*   **Niger Delta Exploitation**: The Niger Delta, much of which fell within the territory claimed by Biafra, became Sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil-producing region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:02">[05:48:02]</a>. However, little of the revenue reached local communities, who instead experienced huge environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>. This sense of general marginalization, coupled with exploitation and repression, appeared to kickstart the revival of the [[biafran_independence_movement|Biafran independence movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:12">[06:04:12]</a>.

### Current Government Stance and Repression

Since the establishment of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) in 1999 and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in 2012, the Nigerian Government has consistently cracked down on neo-Biafran sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:15">[06:16:15]</a>.

*   **Legal Measures and Arrests**: In 2005, MASSOB membership was outlawed, and its leader, Ralph Uwazuruike, was arrested in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:24">[06:51:24]</a>. The current tensions can be traced back to 2015 with the election of President Muhammadu Buhari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:35">[07:02:35]</a> and the arrest of IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu in October 2015 on charges of sedition and treason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:18">[07:31:18]</a>.
*   **Use of Force**: Protests following Kanu's arrest erupted into violence, met with harsh repression by government forces, including what Amnesty International termed "the deliberate use of deadly force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:06">[07:47:06]</a>.
*   **Designation of Terrorist Organization**: In 2017, the Nigerian Government officially designated IPOB as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:25">[08:04:25]</a>.
*   **President Buhari's Stance**: President Muhammadu Buhari, a former general and military ruler from the Muslim North, made it clear upon his election that he would come down hard on the country's growing number of insurgencies and separatist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:24">[07:08:24]</a>. He has been accused of not doing enough to stop attacks by Fulani herders encroaching on Igbo territory, despite being Fulani himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:03">[08:45:03]</a>.
*   **Twitter Ban (2021)**: In early June 2021, Nigeria banned Twitter after the platform deleted a tweet from President Buhari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The tweet referred to the Biafra War and suggested the government would "again resort to force" to crack down on resurgent separatist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This demonstrated the government's continued determination to suppress secessionist sentiment and control information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The Nigerian government appears determined to continue its efforts to crack down on [[biafran_independence_movement|Biafran independence movement]] sentiment, facing growing separatist challenges elsewhere in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:15">[10:45:15]</a>. The president's recent threats raise the prospect that the government is not planning to back down, potentially leading to a return to serious violence in southeast Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:07">[11:47:07]</a>.

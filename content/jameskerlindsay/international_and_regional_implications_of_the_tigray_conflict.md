The outbreak of a military offensive in Tigray on November 4, 2020, following months of tensions with the local government, raised concerns that Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country, could be sliding into [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While Ethiopia has experienced conflict historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, the [[tigray_crisis_in_ethiopia | Tigray Crisis]] presents a particularly serious development with significant international and regional ramifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

## Risk of Full-Scale Civil War

The fighting in Tigray prompts particular concern amongst observers because, unlike other insurgencies, it has the potential to lead to a full-scale [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray | civil war]] in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This is due to Tigray being home to a significant proportion of Ethiopia's troops and weaponry, and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) maintaining its own forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This makes a direct confrontation between Ethiopia and Tigray distinct from other armed insurgencies faced by the Ethiopian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. Such an escalation could potentially pull the country apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

## Regional Instability and Spillover Effects

A serious conflict in Ethiopia has the potential for far wider effects beyond its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

### Involvement of Neighbouring States
There are fears that neighbouring states, such as Eritrea, could become involved in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

### Humanitarian Crisis
The conflict presents an obvious humanitarian issue, not only within Ethiopia but regionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. Serious fighting could lead to significant refugee outflows into neighbouring regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

### Wider [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | Regional Instability]]
Refugee movements and the conflict itself could feed wider [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | regional instability]] across the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

## International Calls for Restraint

Given the potential for severe escalation, there have been widespread international calls for both sides to show restraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. The escalating tensions between Ethiopia and Tigray are seen as posing a very real threat to peace and security in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

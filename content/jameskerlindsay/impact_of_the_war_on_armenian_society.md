The [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | 2020 Armenia and Azerbaijan war]] was a brief but bloody conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A year after the conflict, the effects on Armenian society are profound, despite appearances of normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. War is inherently traumatic for a nation, especially one on the losing end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Societal Response to Defeat

The war is an "extremely sensitive and difficult subject" for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. It has challenged a long-held sense of invulnerability established over decades of Armenian control over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Armenians reconcile the country's defeat in specific ways:
*   **Anger at Turkey:** There is significant anger directed at Turkey for its support of Azerbaijan, not only in terms of equipment but also military leadership and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Many believe Turkey "directed the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Perception of an Unfair Fight:** A deeply held view is that Azerbaijan did not engage in a "fair fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Many argue the outcome would have been different without Turkish and, to some extent, Israeli technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The idea of an unfair fight is frequently raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Perceptions of External Actors

There are complex perceptions regarding the roles of other international actors:
*   **Disillusionment with EU and US:** There is a clear sense of disillusionment about the lack of action from the European Union and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Beyond expecting intervention based on humanitarian grounds, there's a geopolitical and even "civilizational" aspect to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Many Armenians believe their country prevents a "Turkic arc" from Europe to Central Asia, and therefore, Armenia's vital position should be understood and fully supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Complex Picture with Russia:** While Armenia maintains a close relationship with Moscow and many still consider Russia a key ally with strong influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, there is also a "real sense of anger and suspicion about Russia's role in the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Russia only intervened at the last moment, after most Armenian-held territory had been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Trust in Russia often stems from a lack of other viable options, rather than genuine faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Societal Appearance vs. Reality

On the surface, particularly from central Yerevan, there is little to indicate that Armenia is a country recovering from a major war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The city appears "remarkably normal," bustling with good restaurants, high-end shops, and nice cars, making it hard to believe it experienced such a serious conflict a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

However, "beneath the surface, it's clear that the war has obviously had a profound effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. As noted, "no family was untouched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Many volunteered to fight, thousands were killed, and many are still missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Occasional stark reminders of the conflict, such as plaques dedicated to fallen soldiers, exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Ongoing Trauma

There is a pervasive sense of "unfinished business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
*   **Prisoners of War:** Armenian soldiers are still held prisoner by Azerbaijan, with allegations of torture and executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This remains an extremely sensitive issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Instability:** Many feel the [[2020_armenia_azerbaijan_war_impact | 2020 conflict]] has not truly ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, with ongoing skirmishes along the new ceasefire line, including a heavy bout of fighting in November 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Full-scale fighting is feared to erupt again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

Outwardly, Armenians have not given up on Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. They view the 2020 war as a setback, but believe the land will be retaken, asserting that it "is, and should be, a part of Armenia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Just as Azerbaijanis spoke of their territory being held by Armenians, Armenians now speak similarly of their territory held by Azerbaijanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

This implies that the [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | conflict]] has not ended in the minds of Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. A compromise involving territorial autonomy currently seems unacceptable to either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. From the Armenian perspective, it is "far too soon to talk about any longer-term settlement, let alone reconciliation, between Armenia and Azerbaijan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Ultimately, while life in Yerevan appears remarkably untouched on the surface, beneath this apparent normality, Armenia is described as a country "still in the state of denial about what happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

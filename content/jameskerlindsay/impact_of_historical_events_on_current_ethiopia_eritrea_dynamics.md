In October 2023, remarks by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali regarding Ethiopia's need for access to the strategically vital Red Sea sparked fears of renewed conflict in the Horn of Africa. Neighboring Eritrea responded by putting its forces on alert, raising concerns about a return to war between the two nations, which share a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While immediate threats appeared to subside, concerns persist about the potential for future conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Context

[[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]], situated in the Horn of Africa, is the world's 26th largest country and Africa's 10th largest state, covering 1.1 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It is landlocked, bordering six UN members and the internationally unrecognised Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In contrast, [[eritreas_history_and_colonial_past | Eritrea]], located to Ethiopia's northeast, boasts a long coastline on the Red Sea, a crucial strategic waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Eritrea is significantly smaller at 125,000 square kilometers and shares land borders with Djibouti and Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Demographically, Ethiopia has a population of 120 million, making it Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, while Eritrea's population is around 3.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The two countries share ethnic ties, notably the Tigrayans, who constitute over half of Eritrea's population and are the third-largest group in Ethiopia at 7-8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Historical Ties and Colonial Interventions

The shared [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | history]] of Ethiopia and Eritrea dates back to antiquity, including the Kingdom of Axum, which encompassed both present-day Eritrea and northern Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, the modern dynamic was largely shaped by 19th-century European colonial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Italy established a trading outpost in Eritrea in 1869, eventually creating the Colony of Eritrea and taking control of Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Despite initial resistance, Ethiopia (then Abyssinia) also fell under Italian control in 1936, though this occupation was short-lived, ending in 1941 with the defeat of Italy by British forces and Ethiopian guerrillas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Ethiopia regained independence and became a founding member of the United Nations, while Eritrea came under British trusteeship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## The Federation and Its Dissolution

Initially, Eritrea was expected to exercise self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, deep divisions emerged: Muslim Eritreans favored independence, while most Christians, primarily belonging to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, preferred union with Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Ethiopia, desperate for Red Sea access, strongly desired this union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

The UN General Assembly, unable to agree on a single outcome, presented three options: annexation by Ethiopia, a federation between the two, or a 10-year trust territory period for Eritrea before independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The second option, a federation, was chosen, leading to the creation of the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea on September 15, 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

This was an "unhappy union" from the start. Ethiopia, being much larger and with a long history of independence, immediately saw itself as the senior partner, fostering growing resentment in Eritrea over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This culminated in September 1961 when the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) launched an uprising against Ethiopian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. In response, Ethiopia dissolved the Federation and formally annexed Eritrea, initiating the Eritrean War of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## The Eritrean War of Independence and Shifting Alliances

The war intensified after the overthrow of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie by a Marxist military coup in September 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The ELF split, leading to the formation of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which allied with other groups fighting the new regime, most significantly the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ethiopia's key benefactor, rebel forces gained the upper hand. By May 1991, the TPLF, EPLF, and their allies took control of Addis Ababa, ousting the Ethiopian military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This fundamentally transformed Eritrea's prospects.

## Eritrea's Independence and Initial Amity

The EPLF established a government in Asmara and announced an independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Ethiopian parties agreed that Eritrea should not be forced to remain part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In April 1993, with UN support, Eritrea held its referendum, with 99.8% voting for statehood on a 98% turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Eritrea was admitted as the 183rd member of the United Nations on May 28, 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Despite Ethiopia becoming landlocked, relations initially appeared very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## The Border War (1998-2000) and Persistent Tensions

Problems soon emerged, primarily centered on the disputed border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Eritrea claimed territory along the entire boundary, but its claim to parts of the Ethiopian province of Tigray was particularly contentious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. As the Tigrayans of the TPLF dominated the new Ethiopian government, they fiercely rejected Eritrea's demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

After several years of escalating tensions, war broke out on May 6, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This brutal conflict resulted in as many as 100,000 deaths and massive displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Ethiopia gained the upper hand, leading to a UN-monitored ceasefire in June 2000 and a formal peace deal six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

As part of the peace deal, a boundary commission was created in cooperation with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. In 2002, the commission awarded a small Tigrayan village to Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This decision angered Ethiopia, and despite agreeing to be bound by the outcome, the Ethiopian government rejected it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. While it didn't immediately lead to a new war, it ensured high tensions and occasional violent clashes between the neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Abiy Ahmed's Reforms and the Tigray Conflict

A significant shift occurred in April 2018 with the election of Abiy Ahmed Ali as Ethiopia's Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. As an ethnic Oromo, he began to challenge the entrenched Tigrayan dominance of Ethiopian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Two months into his tenure, Abiy surprised the world by announcing his government's acceptance of the Border Commission's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This move garnered international praise, earning Abiy the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, and led to an immediate thawing of relations with Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Abiy Ahmed met with Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea's long-standing totalitarian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

However, this decision caused outrage in Tigray, where the TPLF still dominated local politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Tensions rapidly escalated in 2020 when Ethiopia postponed national elections due to the pandemic, but Tigray proceeded with its vote, resulting in a decisive TPLF win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. With neither side recognizing the other's legitimacy, this led to the [[international_and_regional_implications_of_the_tigray_conflict | Tigray Conflict]] in November 2020, as Abiy Ahmed sent the Ethiopian National Defense Force to regain control of Tigray and remove the TPLF from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Abiy Ahmed's improved relations with Eritrea paid off during this civil war. Eritrea's President Afwerki, who harbored a deep hatred for the TPLF, quickly offered support to Addis Ababa, providing sanctuary to Ethiopian troops fleeing into Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The situation further deteriorated when the TPLF launched rocket attacks on Eritrea, following reports that Eritrea allowed Ethiopia to launch attacks on Tigray from its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Within months, reports emerged that Eritrean forces had assisted the Ethiopian Army in Tigray, leading to claims of atrocities and potential war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Despite initial Tigrayan resurgence, the tide turned in 2022 with renewed Eritrean support for Ethiopian troops, pushing Tigrayan forces back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The African Union brokered a peace deal, leading to the surrender and demobilization of TPLF forces and Ethiopia reasserting control over the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Current Dynamics and Future Concerns

Renewed concerns about a return to war are driven by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Eritrea was notably excluded from the peace talks that ended the Tigray conflict, despite its alliance with the Ethiopian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Claims of Eritrean troops still being present in Tigray have further soured relations between Asmara and Addis Ababa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The immediate cause for concern was Abiy Ahmed's October 2023 speech asserting Ethiopia's right to access the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Given that many Ethiopians still consider Eritrea a historic part of their country, this sparked fears of an Ethiopian invasion of Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The movement of Eritrean forces near the border, reciprocated by Ethiopia, heightened these concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Although Abiy Ahmed sought to alleviate fears by insisting Ethiopia would not pursue its interests by force or attack "its fellow brothers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, the long history of tensions and Ethiopia's persistent desire for maritime access leave many wondering if the two nations are indeed headed towards another conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | potential consequences of conflict for Ethiopia's future]] remain a significant concern.

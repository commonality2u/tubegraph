The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]], also known as the Nigerian Civil War, was one of the most brutal and bloody conflicts of modern times, resulting in a million deaths and millions more displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of secession and independence, yet it is largely forgotten today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## International Stance on Secession

The international community has a deep aversion to secession, particularly unilateral secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This current thinking evolved over several decades after 1945 and the founding of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Contemporary attitudes towards secession can be traced back to two specific cases of separatism in Africa during the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The first was Katanga's attempt to break away from the Democratic Republic of the Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While Katanga's secession established the idea of opposing unilateral secession, these ideas were cemented by the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Together, these cases underscored that the principle of respecting the territorial integrity of states applied not only to external threats but also to internal attempts to secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] is also notable for its humanitarian tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. When it took place in the late 1960s, it was widely considered the humanitarian tragedy of its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Over its three-year duration, well over a million people died, either directly from fighting or indirectly from famine and illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Roots of the Conflict: Nigeria's Formation

Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the 31st largest UN member by area and the most populous country in Africa, with an estimated 200 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. It is extremely diverse, comprising over 250 different ethno-linguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The three main groups are:
*   **Hausa and Fulani**: Around 30% of the population, mainly in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Yoruba**: Around 20% of the population, from the southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Igbo**: Around 20% of the population, from the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The story of the conflict begins with the [[colonial_history_and_its_impact_on_nigerias_formation | European colonial scramble for Africa]] in the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. British forces captured Lagos in 1851, annexing it in 1865 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Other territories in the region were awarded to Britain under the Berlin Conference in 1885 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. These became the Southern Nigerian Protectorate and Northern Nigerian Protectorate in 1900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The crucial moment came in 1914 when, facing a budget deficit in the North, the two protectorates were merged to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This decision, taken for economic reasons, created an entity fundamentally at odds with itself, leading to profound implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Following World War II and decolonization, Britain prepared to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. In 1954, Nigeria was reconstituted as the Federation of Nigeria, composed of three regions broadly mapping onto the main ethnic groups: Hausa-Fulani Northern Nigeria, Igbo Eastern Nigeria, and Yoruba Western Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Nigeria formally gained independence on 1 October 1960, joining the United Nations shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Path to War

Nigeria held its first post-independence general election in 1964, marred by serious political violence and disputed results that saw a victory by the Northern People's Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Tensions escalated throughout 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

On 15 January 1966, junior military officers from the southern Igbo ethnic group launched an attempted coup, resulting in the assassination of 22 senior political and military figures, including the prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Although the coup was quickly defeated, its effects were widely felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. On 28 July, northern army officers carried out another coup, executing several hundred southerners, mostly ethnic Igbo, in reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Attacks on Igbo living in the north increased, with an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This sparked a mass exodus of up to 2 million Igbo from the north, fleeing south to the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

With the country in crisis, talk of eastern secession grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. On 4 and 5 January 1967, the British Government organized a peace conference in Ghana between Nigerian leader Colonel Yakubu Gowon and Eastern Province leader Colonel Odomegwu Ojukwu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The sides appeared to reach an agreement, the Aburi Accord, but a dispute soon arose over its interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Ojukwu believed it paved the way for a loose confederation, but the central government rejected this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. In early May, to weaken the East (a center of oil production), the government announced Nigeria would be reconstituted into 12 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

On 30 May 1967, Ojukwu unilaterally declared independence, formally proclaiming the creation of the Republic of [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Just over a month later, on 6 July 1967, the federal government declared war on the breakaway province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Course of the War (The Nigerian Civil War)

The war's outcome seemed never in doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. In the following months, the Nigerian army made considerable headway, aided by non-Igbo areas in the East siding with the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The area controlled by [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran]] authorities shrank by a third by August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. In October, the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran]] capital, Enugu, fell to Nigerian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

The most significant blow came in May 1968 when the government took control of Port Harcourt, imposing a blockade on [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This resulted in a famine that killed well over a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. By the end of 1969, the conflict was all but lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. In early 1970, Ojukwu fled, and on 15 January, after 30 months, the war officially ended when the chief of the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran]] Army declared the Republic of [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]] had ceased to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. A few days later, General Gowon, head of Nigeria's military government, stated there was "no victor, no vanquished" to begin national reconciliation and reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Nigeria has since deliberately tried to forget its civil war, though pro-[[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran]] sentiment still exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## [[international_responses_to_the_biafran_secession | International Responses]] and Legacy

The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] had a huge international impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Publicly, the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran]] cause garnered massive sympathy, especially after images of starving [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran]] children emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This led to a major international [[the_humanitarian_crisis_during_the_biafran_war | humanitarian effort]], the Biafran Airlift, by NGOs and church groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Officially, [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]] received some support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Five UN members recognized it as an independent state: Tanzania (13 April 1968), followed by Gabon, Ivory Coast, Zambia, and Haiti (the only non-African state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Behind the scenes, [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]] also received military assistance from Spain, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa, Israel, and France, who all saw a weakened Nigeria as potentially beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

However, these were outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The vast majority of the international community supported the Nigerian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. African states, in particular, viewed the developments with grave concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Like Nigeria, many had recently become independent within colonial borders that mixed diverse ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. They saw [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]]'s secession as an existential threat to their own territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), forerunner of today's African Union, played a key role in rallying regional and international support for Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Two countries became particularly strong Nigerian allies:
*   **Britain**: Driven by a desire to prevent recognition of Rhodesia's 1965 unilateral declaration of independence, and seeking to protect its significant oil investments in Nigeria, believing Nigeria would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union (USSR)**: Saw the war as an opportunity to win over Nigeria, which had been a strong opponent of communism in sub-Saharan Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The United States largely steered clear, viewing it as an internal affair and unwilling to become embroiled in another conflict while fighting in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. It officially remained neutral and did not supply arms to either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Despite limited support for [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]], its attempt to break away cemented the idea that states should not recognize unilateral secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Previously, respecting territorial integrity was understood as respecting borders against external aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, the Congo Crisis and then [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra]] underscored the emerging idea that states should also respect each other's territorial integrity in the face of internal separatist threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, remains one of the most obviously divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The British decision to merge the two Nigerian protectorates for economic reasons created an entity fundamentally at odds with itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This had dramatic and tragic consequences after independence in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Tensions between north and south spilled into political violence, leading to mass killings and one of the most significant wars to affect modern Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] was widely regarded as the most pressing [[the_humanitarian_crisis_during_the_biafran_war | humanitarian disaster]] of its day, with millions dying over two and a half years, largely due to mass starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It also left a powerful legacy for contemporary rules on secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. While public opinion often sympathized with the Igbo, most countries, especially in Africa, officially or tacitly supported Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Facing their own secessionist challenges, they saw the conflict as a chance to affirm the importance of respecting state territorial integrity against both external and internal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

Despite its significance, the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]] remains largely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

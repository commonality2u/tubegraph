In January 2024, significant [[unrest_in_bashkortostan | unrest]] erupted in the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan, as thousands participated in protests [00:00:00]. This event has sparked questions about potential internal pressures within Russia, especially given the disproportionate effect of the war in Ukraine on Russia's ethnic minorities [00:00:09].

## Bashkortostan: A Diverse Republic

The Russian Federation, the world's largest country by area, is home to around 145 million people and boasts nearly 200 ethnic groups [00:01:29]. While ethnic Russians form the majority, Islam, Buddhism, and other faiths are also practiced alongside the predominant Russian Orthodoxy [00:01:55]. Russia is administratively divided into 83 federal subjects, including republics like Bashkortostan [00:02:10].

Bashkortostan is located in the southern Ural Mountains, near Russia's border with Kazakhstan [00:02:28]. It is Russia's sixth-largest republic by area (143,000 sq km or 55,000 sq miles) but ranks first in population with four million inhabitants [00:02:34].

### Ethnic Composition
Bashkortostan is ethnically diverse [00:02:49]:
*   **Ethnic Russians** comprise the largest group at 36% of the population, according to the 2010 census [00:02:53].
*   **Ethnic Bashkirs** make up around 30% [00:02:58]. They are a Turkic group speaking a language related to Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Tatar, and are predominantly Sunni Muslims [00:03:04].
*   **Tatars** constitute a quarter of the population [00:03:14]. Like the Bashkirs, they are a Muslim Turkic community [00:03:14].

### Economic Significance
Economically, Bashkortostan possesses considerable mineral wealth, including oil, gas, iron ore, manganese, and copper [00:03:21]. It also has a significant manufacturing base and extensive agriculture [00:03:29].

## Historical Context of Ethnic Relations

The region of Bashkortostan has a long and complex history [00:03:35]. Turkic-speaking tribes, including the Bashkirs, migrated there in the 7th century [00:03:39].

### Imperial Russia
*   In 1235, the Mongols conquered the Bashkirs, making the area part of the Kipchak Khanate (Golden Horde) [00:03:50].
*   It later came under the Kazan Khanate [00:03:59].
*   Russian forces under Ivan the Terrible began expanding into the Urals in the 16th century [00:04:05]. Despite fierce resistance, the Bashkirs were conquered and became part of Imperial Russia in 1557 [00:04:13].
*   Ethnic Russians began to settle in the region [00:04:20].
*   The Bashkirs rebelled against Russian rule repeatedly over the next three centuries, with major uprisings in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, but the region remained under imperial control [00:04:26].

### Soviet Era
*   The Russian Revolution in 1917 led to Russia collapsing into civil war, and the wider region declared autonomy as the Idel-Ural State [00:04:45].
*   Bashkir nationalists subsequently created a separate entity, Bashkiria [00:04:56].
*   Both territories were short-lived as the Red Army overran the region in 1919 [00:05:05].
*   The Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [00:05:08].
*   Over the following decades, the Bashkir ASSR saw significant economic development with growing mining and industry [00:05:24].
*   As the Soviet Union weakened, ethnic Bashkirs began pushing for greater language and cultural rights [00:05:33].

### Post-Soviet Period
*   Following the USSR's dissolution in December 1991, the Bashkir ASSR was renamed Bashkortostan, acknowledging its Turkic heritage [00:05:39].
*   In 1994, Bashkortostan signed an agreement with Moscow, granting it extensive autonomy within the Russian Federation and complete control over its natural resources and environmental protection [00:05:52].

## Sources of Modern Tensions
The situation in Bashkortostan has become increasingly strained over the past three decades [00:06:07].
*   **Reduced Autonomy**: There has been a steady rollback of the republic's autonomy, with power increasingly centralized in Moscow [00:06:15].
*   **Economic Exploitation**: Growing unhappiness stems from the region's economic exploitation, which is linked to substantial environmental damage [00:06:25].
*   **Interethnic Tensions**: [[ethnic_divisions_in_bosniaherzegovina | Interethnic tensions]] have increased, particularly between the Bashkirs and Tatars [00:06:38].
*   **Resurgence of Bashkir Identity**: This has fueled Bashkir resentment, leading to a resurgence in support for increased language and cultural rights, and the emergence of social and ecological movements [00:06:44]. One prominent group, Bashkort, was banned in 2020 for extremism [00:06:57].
*   **Impact of Ukraine War**: The war has led to growing tensions, as Russia's outlying regions and ethnic communities have been disproportionately affected by casualties and reduced government spending due to war diversions [00:07:04].

## The Fail Alsynov Case: A Catalyst for Protest
The deep-rooted disenchantment transformed into widespread protests following the arrest of Fail Alsynov, an activist and former leader of Bashkort [00:07:21].
*   **Background**: Alsynov was protesting gold mining and had previously raised concerns about the disproportionate casualties from Bashkortostan and other poorer regions in the war in Ukraine, openly calling the mobilization a "genocide" of the Bashkir people [00:07:28].
*   **Arrest and Sentencing**: He was accused of using a derogatory term against guest workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, which he insisted was a mistranslation [00:07:52]. On January 17, 2024, a provincial court sentenced him to four years in a penal colony for inciting racial hatred [00:07:56].
*   **Protests**: Alsynov immediately appealed, arguing he was a victim of state oppression [00:08:06]. The verdict sparked outrage among hundreds, if not thousands, of his supporters who gathered for the trial [00:08:15]. This quickly led to clashes with riot police, who used tear gas and batons, making dozens of arrests [00:08:29].
*   **Escalation**: Several more protests erupted in the following days, defying warnings from Bashkortostan's interior minister [00:08:38]. A major demonstration even broke out in the capital, Ufa [00:08:50]. The situation was further inflamed by claims of police brutality and the news of a protester's death in police custody [00:08:54].
*   **Significance**: These demonstrations amounted to one of the most serious outbreaks of [[ethnic_tensions_in_nigeria | ethnic tensions]] in recent years and seemingly the largest protest faced by Russian authorities since the start of the Ukraine war [00:09:04].

## [[government_response_to_protests_in_bashkortostan | Government Response to Protests in Bashkortostan]]
The protests rattled the local leadership [00:09:17].
*   **Local Reaction**: Bashkortostan's leader, Radiy Khabirov, claimed outside forces were behind the protests [00:09:20]. The local government swiftly moved to control further unrest [00:09:25].
*   **Suppression Measures**: Police investigations are ongoing, with warnings that demonstrators may be charged with mass rioting, carrying a 15-year jail term [00:09:30]. Steps have been taken to prevent further unrest, including taking social media pages promoting demonstrations offline and investigating a local singer for encouraging participation [00:09:41]. Efforts were made to shore up support, including a public concert where workers were reportedly forced to attend [00:09:57].
*   **Moscow's Stance**: Moscow appeared keen to distance itself from the issue [00:10:12]. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disputed that it constituted mass unrest, calling them "individual instances" and a "local problem" [00:10:19].

## Implications for Russian Unity
The protests raise questions about their danger to Russian unity [00:10:33].
*   **Potential for Spread**: Russia's considerable ethnic diversity, coupled with widespread discontent over discrimination, economic deprivation, and disproportionate losses faced by minorities in the Ukraine war, suggests that such local instances have the potential to spread [00:10:41].
*   **Limiting Factors**: However, the developments should be kept in proportion [00:11:02]. The protests involved only several thousand demonstrators, a small fraction of Bashkortostan's population, and have since quietened down [00:11:16]. Furthermore, ethnic Russians outnumber Bashkirs in the republic, and there does not appear to be a natural alliance between Bashkirs and Tatars [00:11:34].
*   **Long-Term Significance**: Despite these limiting factors, the protests cannot be dismissed as a purely localized incident [00:11:45]. This was the most serious outbreak of ethnic rioting in Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, occurring in its most populous republic [00:11:53]. It highlights how the conflict in Ukraine could catalyze deeper ethnic resentment based on local grievances, posing a significant concern for the Kremlin [00:12:03].

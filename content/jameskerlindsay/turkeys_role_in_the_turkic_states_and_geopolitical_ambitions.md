In November 2022, leaders of the Organization of Turkic States convened in Uzbekistan, signaling a potential shift in the region's geopolitical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This meeting occurred amidst a perceived decline in Russia's influence in Central Asia due to the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, coupled with growing concerns about China's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. These factors suggest the possible [[emergence_of_turkic_states_as_a_geopolitical_bloc | emergence of an important new geopolitical bloc]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

While international relations often focus on individual sovereign states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, the post-1945 era has shown states increasingly choose to collaborate for various reasons, including shared political, economic, or security outlooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, regional cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, religious affinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, or historical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The Turkic states represent an interesting emerging example of states coming together due to shared ethno-national links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## The Turkic States: A Profile

The Turkic states generally include six countries: Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. These nations span an arc from Europe to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Additionally, Turkic communities exist in countries like Russia, China, Iran, and various European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Collectively, the six Turkic states cover 4.7 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, which would make them the seventh largest country globally if unified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Their combined population is 162 million, with over half residing in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, making it the ninth most populous state worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Economically, their total GDP is almost $1.2 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, positioning them as the 15th largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

These countries are primarily linked by language, belonging to a single, albeit branched, language family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Most Turkic peoples adhere to Sunni Islam, though many are secular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Azerbaijan is predominantly Shia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, and Christian Turkic communities also exist in Russia and Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Historical Separation and Renewed Connection

The Turkic peoples are believed to originate from the Altai mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. A Turkic Empire emerged in the 6th century, expanding westward and establishing a cultural, trading, and intellectual interaction along the Silk Road for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. In the 8th century, they converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, and by the 11th century, the Seljuk Turkic tribe pushed into the Middle East and later into the Anatolian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The Ottoman Turks, emerging in the late 13th century, significantly expanded their territories, eventually controlling vast parts of Southeast Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa for 350 years after conquering Constantinople in 1453 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

For over a thousand years, the eastern and western Turkic peoples were effectively separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. In the 19th century, both faced the challenge of Imperial Russia's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The First World War was a turning point, leading to the creation of Soviet Socialist Republics in Central Asia and Azerbaijan in the 1920s and 30s after the fall of the Russian Tsarist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Simultaneously, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire led to the [[turkeys_historical_orientation_towards_europe | emergence of the European-facing Republic of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

During the Cold War, the Turkic world became profoundly estranged; Turkey joined NATO in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a> and maintained almost no relations with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia for four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Turkey's Ambitions Post-1991

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, as the five predominantly Turkic republics became sovereign independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Turkey immediately sought to extend its influence, being the first country to recognize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a> and convening a summit in Ankara in October 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. However, initial attempts to create and lead a new bloc yielded little success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, as the new republics remained closely tied to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Consequently, Turkey's focus drifted back to its primary objective of joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

### The Erdogan Era and Renewed Engagement

A new era began in 2002 with the Justice and Development Party, led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, coming to power in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. While initially focused on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, by the end of the decade, Erdogan began to envision Turkey as a major international actor with influence extending to the Turkic states of Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. He saw himself as a leader capable of expanding Turkey's influence across the Balkans, the Middle East, and further afield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

This renewed interest materialized in October 2009 with the formation of the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States (Turkic Council) by Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The group held its first summit in Almaty in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>, aiming to foster economic, political, trading, and cultural links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. The Council expanded to include Hungary (2014) and Turkmenistan (2021) as observers, and Uzbekistan as a full member in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. However, for a period, the Council was seen as merely a discussion forum with little notable achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

### Recent Developments

Things began to change significantly in late 2021 when the Turkic Council renamed itself the Organization of Turkic States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. This change was clearly intended to elevate the group's profile and provide new impetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. This was further solidified at the November 2022 summit in Uzbekistan, where leaders agreed on measures to strengthen activities, including the creation of a Turkic Investment Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Controversially, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, an internationally unrecognized entity, was admitted as an observer, drawing widespread criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Impetus for Closer Ties

The drive for greater cooperation among Turkic states is fueled by a genuine desire for integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, but also by [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | wider geopolitical factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>:

*   **Decline of Russian Influence**: Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has accelerated a sense that Moscow's long-standing influence in Central Asia is rapidly declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Kazakhstan, despite its membership in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), has avoided supporting Moscow's actions and seems to be distancing itself from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Similar trends are observed with Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan have also risen following Russia's intervention in Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   **Concerns about China**: While many Turkic countries have close ties with Beijing, they are also apprehensive about China's increasing strength and influence in the region, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>, which prominently features Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

These factors provide strong reasons for the Turkic countries to strengthen their cooperation, acknowledging the value of their shared ethnocultural ties despite a long history of separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

## Turkey's Potential Leadership

There are voices within the Organization of Turkic States who envision it as a political community modeled on the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. The question of leadership is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

The obvious candidate for leadership is Turkey, and specifically President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. Having moved further from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>, locked in a strained relationship with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>, and with an eye on his legacy, Erdogan may seek to cement his influence as the leader of the Turkic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. Turkey, as a country, might also feel it has a natural right to lead, being the most populous and wealthiest member of the Organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

However, a key question remains: whether other Turkic leaders would accept such a dominant role for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. Nevertheless, the growing ties among Turkic states now appear to be underpinned by a more tangible sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>, suggesting that the [[emergence_of_turkic_states_as_a_geopolitical_bloc | emergence of a new geopolitical grouping]] is a situation worth closely watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

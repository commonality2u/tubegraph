The [[The Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] is considered one of Africa's most serious conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It has resulted in thousands of lives lost and the displacement of hundreds of thousands, directly impacting millions more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This conflict largely stems from the historical and linguistic divide between the English-speaking and French-speaking regions of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Geographic and Linguistic Context

Cameroon is located in West Africa and covers an area of 475,000 square kilometers (180,000 square miles), making it the 53rd largest UN member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Its population is estimated at around 26 million, comprising various ethnic groups and an estimated 24 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The two official languages are French and English, with French being the primary language for the vast majority, while approximately 20 percent of the population are primarily English speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## [[Colonial History of Cameroon | Colonial Legacy]] and Division

The roots of the divide trace back to the 19th-century "Scramble for Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Germany established its most significant imperial holding in the territory of Kamerun, which included modern-day Cameroon and parts of the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, and Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. German control was formalized at the Berlin Conference in 1884 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

However, German control ended during World War I when Britain and France seized and divided the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. France took control of about 80 percent, while Britain took the remaining 20 percent, which bordered its Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Britain's control over the British Cameroons was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. These British Cameroons were administered from Nigeria and further divided into Northern and Southern Cameroons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This [[Colonial legacy and its impact on Cameroons conflict | colonial legacy]] laid the foundation for the future Anglophone-Francophone split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Decolonization and Unification

As decolonization progressed after World War II, both British and French Cameroons became UN Trust Territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. On January 1, 1960, the French Cameroons gained independence as the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The future of the British Cameroons was then decided through referendums after several UN missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Both Northern and Southern Cameroons were given two options: join independent Nigeria or unite with the Republic of Cameroon; independence was not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

*   **Northern Cameroons**: Held its referendum on February 11, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The predominantly Muslim Northern Cameroons voted by 60 percent to join Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Despite objections from the Republic of Cameroon, this union took place on May 31, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Southern Cameroons**: Also held its referendum on February 11, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Here, 70 percent of voters chose to join the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The UN endorsed this result on April 21, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Following contested talks, it was determined that the two parts would unite as a federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. On October 1, 1961, the Southern Cameroons officially joined, and the country became the Federal Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Erosion of Anglophone Autonomy

The relationship between the Anglophone and Francophone parts soon deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Despite some Anglophones holding senior positions, like John Foncha (who became Prime Minister and Vice President) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, the English-speaking minority felt overpowered by the French-speaking majority, which had established a highly centralized federation under autocratic President Ahmadou Ahidjo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

This led to significant changes:
*   **1972 Referendum**: On May 20, 1972, a referendum abolished the federation, granting more powers to the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The country was simultaneously renamed the United Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Decline of Powers**: In subsequent years, the Anglophone region (divided into North West and South West provinces) saw its powers continue to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Paul Biya's Presidency**: In 1982, Paul Biya replaced Ahidjo as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. He further eroded the region's autonomy and changed the country's name back to the original Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Rise of Anglophone Activism

Against this backdrop of eroding autonomy, English-speaking groups convened the first All Anglophone Conference in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. They issued a declaration calling for the restoration of the 1961 federal constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Anglophones also began campaigning internationally, with former prime minister Foncha advocating for the region's autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

In 1994, the Conference reiterated its demands, threatening a declaration of independence if they were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. In response, the [[Government and Separatist Dynamics in Cameroon | government]] further changed the constitution, removing the last vestiges of decentralization, and launched a crackdown on what it considered separatism, leading to arrests and sporadic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. By around 2000, political unrest appeared largely quelled, though pro-independence political activity continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## The Current [[Cameroons Anglophone Crisis | Anglophone Crisis]] (2016-Present)

The current phase of the [[Cameroons Anglophone Crisis | crisis]] began in late 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Protests erupted over the increasing number of French speakers assigned to schools and courts in the Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The [[Government and Separatist Dynamics in Cameroon | government]] responded with another crackdown, which quickly escalated into violence as armed groups resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

On October 1, 2017, the anniversary of the Southern Cameroons' incorporation into Cameroon, several groups declared the creation of an independent Federal Republic of Ambazonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Despite many pro-independence organizations favoring peaceful means, the [[Government and Separatist Dynamics in Cameroon | Cameroon government]] launched a major armed campaign against dissent in November 2017, leading to increased militancy among various groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

By mid-2019, the situation became increasingly unstable, with clashes between government forces and separatists, and a rise in civilian targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The [[Humanitarian Impact of the Crisis in Cameroon | humanitarian impact]] was severe, with thousands killed and over half a million displaced, tens of thousands fleeing to Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Anglophone militias also targeted schools, viewing them as instruments for the government to impose French, resulting in the closure of an estimated 80 percent of schools in Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### [[Efforts for a peaceful settlement in Cameroons Anglophone regions | Attempts at Resolution]] and Continued Conflict

In 2019, as fighting threatened civil war by spilling into Francophone areas, President Biya announced a "Major National Dialogue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Although many Anglophone groups dismissed it as propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, proposals included:
*   Special status for the two Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
*   Election of local governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   Reintegration of fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   Restoration of the name "United Republic of Cameroon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>
*   Re-launch of infrastructure projects in English-speaking regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

These proposals offered some increased autonomy but fell short of restoring federalism or meeting demands for full independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. International observers also deemed them insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

In 2020, reports emerged of secret ceasefire talks between the [[Government and Separatist Dynamics in Cameroon | government]] and jailed pro-independence figures, including Julius AyukTabe, proclaimed first president of Ambazonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. However, these reports were later denied by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Despite growing international calls for dialogue and internal pressure for a peaceful settlement, the fighting has continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. On October 24, 2020, armed fighters attacked a school, killing children, an act condemned by the UN Secretary-General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. There have also been increasing claims of serious human rights abuses by both sides, including kidnapping and use of child soldiers by militias, and extrajudicial killings, torture, and cruel punishment by government forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The death toll and number of displaced continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[Cameroons Anglophone Crisis | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] exemplifies how [[Colonial legacy and its impact on Cameroons conflict | borders drawn during colonial times]] and decisions taken at decolonization can have lasting and tragic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The conflict arises from the forced unification of peoples with distinct historical experiences and cultural traditions within a single state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

A federal settlement offering extensive autonomy to the Anglophone community was once considered an obvious and acceptable solution for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, positions have become polarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Many Anglophones, fundamentally mistrusting the central [[Government and Separatist Dynamics in Cameroon | government]] after decades of repression and efforts to diminish their political and cultural autonomy, are now committed to the idea of an independent Ambazonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Meanwhile, the central [[Government and Separatist Dynamics in Cameroon | government]] remains determined to retain the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

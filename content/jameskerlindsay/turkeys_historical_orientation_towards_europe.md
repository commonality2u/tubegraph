Turkey's strategic orientation has historically been towards Europe and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This long-standing pivot has defined its foreign relations for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, in recent years, the relationship with key Western partners has become increasingly strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Founding and Early Europeanisation

The story of modern Turkey's Western orientation began after the First World War, with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Turkish nationalist forces, led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), established the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The new republic embarked on a path of modernization and Europeanisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This included pushing Islam out of the public realm and introducing the Latin alphabet to replace the Ottoman Arabic script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Integration into Western Institutions

Turkey actively sought integration with Western bodies:
*   In 1950, Turkey became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | NATO]]), the primary Western security body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   It also joined the Council of Europe, the continent's key human rights organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   A decade later, in 1963, Turkey signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC), which later became the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | European Union]] ([[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | EU]]), opening the door to potential membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Challenges to European Integration

Despite these steps, Turkey's hopes for European integration faced significant hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>:
*   **Democratic Concerns**: Several military coups raised questions about Turkey's commitment to democracy, a key requirement for [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Tensions**: Tensions grew with [[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | EU]]-member and fellow [[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | NATO]] partner Greece, particularly over Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **"Christian Club" Perception**: There was a persistent feeling that Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation despite its secular nature, was being excluded from what many perceived as a "Christian club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This impression intensified after the Cold War when the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] opened membership to formerly communist Central and Eastern European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## EU Candidacy and the Erdogan Era

By the late 1990s, relations between Turkey and the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | European Union]] were strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Following a breakthrough in relations with Greece, Turkey finally became a candidate for [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] membership in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

Ironically, the election of an overtly religious administration, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in November 2002, initially gave new impetus to [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] accession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Erdogan viewed [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] membership as a means to expand religious freedom and challenge the military's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This led to political reforms and the formal opening of [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] membership discussions in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Shifting Stance and Growing Estrangement

Erdogan's political outlook began to change, moving towards autocratic tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Human rights reforms were rolled back, and media freedoms curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. A harsh crackdown followed massive protests in May 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. In 2016, an attempted coup against the Erdogan administration led to a major purge of suspected opposition, with tens of thousands arrested and hundreds of thousands fired from their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### The Osman Kavala Case and Diplomatic Crisis

A significant point of contention emerged with the case of Osman Kavala, a Turkish businessman and philanthropist arrested in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled for his immediate release in December 2019, but Turkey refused to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. This led the Council of Europe to begin infringement proceedings against Turkey in September 2021, which could result in suspension or expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

This situation escalated into a [[turkeys_diplomatic_crisis_with_the_west | diplomatic crisis]] in October 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Ambassadors from 10 Western countries, including the United States, France, and Germany, signed a joint letter urging Turkey to abide by the ECHR's ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. In response, President Erdogan announced that these ambassadors were no longer welcome in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. While a "face-saving solution" was quickly found, the incident highlighted the widening rift between Turkey and its Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

### Implications for Turkey's Western Ties

The crisis underscores several fundamental shifts:
*   **Expanding Rift**: Erdogan's announcement further emphasized the growing divide between Turkey and its Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy Shift**: Concerns have grown over [[turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Ankara's foreign policy]], particularly Erdogan's close relationship with [[turkeys_foreign_relations_with_russia_and_the_west | Russia]] ([[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | Russia]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   **Blame on the West**: Erdogan has increasingly blamed Turkey's problems on the West, presenting Europe and the [[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | United States]] as opponents rather than allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
*   **Disregard for Rules**: The dispute highlights Turkey's apparent disregard for basic rules of the Western club, such as adherence to ECHR rulings, which are fundamental for Council of Europe and [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

## The Future of Turkey's Western Orientation

Most observers believe Turkey has already broken with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. The decision for a final political separation largely rests with the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | European Union]] and the [[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

A debate exists among Western policy circles:
*   **Advocates for a Break**: Some argue that Turkey can no longer be considered an ally or a country sharing fundamental values. They call for stopping [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] membership talks, suspension/expulsion from the Council of Europe, and even removal from [[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   **Pragmatists**: Others contend that while [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] accession talks have stalled, a complete break would worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. They fear Turkey would cement partnerships with "troublesome forces" like [[turkeys_foreign_relations_with_russia_and_the_west | Russia]] and negatively impact the [[turkeys_historical_connection_with_the_muslim_world | Muslim world]], where it could be seen as proof of Western opposition to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. They advocate for keeping Turkey nominally in the club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.
*   **Optimists**: Despite despairing under Erdogan, they hope for a future return to the European track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. They believe it is better to maintain the possibility of this return and encourage pro-Western forces in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

The prevailing view is that, despite the problems, it is better to keep Turkey part of the West, even if only in name, rather than force a final split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. However, the recurring crises and Turkey's continued disregard for ECHR rulings may eventually force a decisive action to protect the integrity of human rights bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. This could fundamentally affect Turkey's place in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

Almost a century after its establishment, the Turkish Republic faces the question of whether it will finally break its relationship with the West, or if the [[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | United States]] and [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU]] will allow that to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

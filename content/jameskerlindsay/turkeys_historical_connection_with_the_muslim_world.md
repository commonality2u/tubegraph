Turkey's relationship with the Muslim world has evolved significantly throughout history, from being at the heart of Islamic power to a period of strict secularism, and now, a resurgence of its religious and regional influence.

## The Islamic World: A Diverse Community

The Islamic world, representing a substantial part of the global population, is composed of diverse states [01:25:00]. Islam is the world's second-largest religion with an estimated 1.8 billion adherents, and projections suggest it will surpass Christianity by the end of the century [01:42:00]. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which represents Muslim-majority countries, includes 57 full members and five observers [01:54:00]. These members span five continents, representing about 25% of the world's population and a quarter of its landmass, as well as approximately 10% of the global economy [02:04:00]. Despite the traditional concept of a single religious community (the *ummah*), these nations have often been deeply divided politically, culturally, ideologically, and economically [02:27:00].

## Deep Historical Roots

Turkish people have a long history at the core of the Muslim faith [02:39:00]. Islam originated in Arabia in the 7th century and rapidly expanded across the Middle East and North Africa before spreading to Central Asia [02:45:00]. In the 11th century, Turkic tribes converted to Islam [02:54:00].

One such tribe, the Seljuks, began pushing into the Middle East and conquered Baghdad in 1055, which was then the cultural and political center of the Caliphate [03:00:00]. Their expansion continued, and in 1071, they defeated the Byzantine Empire, allowing other Muslim Turkic tribes to settle in the Anatolian Peninsula [03:18:00].

### The Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate

Around 300 years later, the Ottomans, another Turkic group, launched a rapid campaign of conquest [03:27:00]. They swept away the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire and conquered much of Southeast Europe and the Middle East [03:31:00]. Becoming the most powerful force in the Islamic world, the Ottoman Sultan also assumed the title of Caliph, symbolizing his leadership of the faith [03:41:00]. The Ottoman Empire continued to expand, even seizing parts of the Arabian Peninsula [03:52:00].

## The Age of Secularism

By the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was in decline, with the final blow delivered after the First World War when it sided with Germany and Austria-Hungary [03:55:00]. Following its defeat, remaining territories in the Middle East were divided, and plans were made to carve up its Anatolian heartland [04:05:00].

Turkish nationalist forces, led by General Mustafa Kemal, fought back [04:20:00]. As the Republic of Turkey replaced the Ottoman Empire, the last Sultan was forced to abdicate, and the Caliphate was abolished [04:24:00]. Over subsequent years, Kemal, known as Atatürk, removed the new state's old ties to Islam [04:36:00]. He abolished the Ottoman Arabic script, replacing it with Latin characters, and introduced a strict separation between religion and state [04:41:00].

During this period, Turkey broke off its ties to the Middle East and the broader Islamic world, prioritizing its Western and European orientation [04:52:00]. Turkey joined [[Turkeys relationship with NATO and the EU | NATO]] in 1952 and signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community (forerunner of the EU) ten years later [05:02:00]. In a move that angered many Muslim states, Turkey became the first Muslim-majority state to recognize Israel, eventually forging a close defense and security alliance [05:13:00].

## Erdoğan's Reorientation

Everything began to change at the turn of the millennium [05:27:00]. With Turkey embroiled in economic and political turmoil despite nearly 70 years as a secular republic, a new political force emerged: the Justice and Development Party (AKP) [05:31:00]. This party was led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a former mayor of Istanbul who had been jailed for encouraging religious unrest [05:46:00]. Although the powerful military had previously suppressed religious influence in politics, it now stepped back [05:54:00]. In November 2002, the AKP won national elections, and Erdoğan became Prime Minister the following year [06:07:00].

From the outset, Erdoğan signaled his intention to reorient Turkey [06:33:00]. Domestically, he began to roll back restrictions on religion in public life, openly highlighting his own religious faith, including ending the ban on headscarves in government offices [06:38:00]. He also reduced the military's power and stopped the tradition of expelling officers deemed too religious [06:52:00].

At the same time, Erdoğan steadily reoriented the country's foreign policy [07:00:00]. While maintaining close ties to [[Turkeys relationship with NATO and the EU | NATO]] and the quest to join the European Union, Turkey increased its profile across the Middle East and the broader Muslim world, massively expanding its diplomatic presence [07:04:00].

### Increased Influence and Soft Power

In recent years, Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs has considerably increased its overseas aid [07:18:00]. This has involved building mosques and religious schools, promoting Islamic cultural programs globally, and distributing humanitarian assistance [07:25:00]. Turkey has also become a more active military and security actor, intervening in Libya, Syria, and Iraq, and playing a role in Somalia [07:35:00].

Turkey has also become an increasingly significant voice in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) [07:48:00]. A Turkish Secretary General led the OIC from 2005 to 2013, and Turkey held the organization's chairmanship from 2016 to 2019 [07:55:00].

On top of this, Turkey has become increasingly outspoken on issues resonating with many ordinary Muslims [08:10:00]. For example, during the Arab Spring in 2010, Erdoğan firmly supported efforts to overthrow authoritarian secular regimes in Egypt and Syria, publicly backing Islamist opposition groups [08:19:00]. This fundamentally undermined Ankara's relationship with Cairo and Damascus [08:35:00].

Perhaps most significantly, the Turkish President became a particularly vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause [08:39:00]. In 2010, Turkey's long-standing relationship with Israel collapsed after an Israeli raid on a Turkish aid ship to Gaza resulted in deaths [08:46:00]. Erdoğan's continued support for the Palestinian cause gained popularity as more Arab states normalized relations with Israel [08:58:00]. Although there were signs of rapprochement in 2022, the relationship worsened significantly after the start of the war in Gaza [09:06:00]. Erdoğan has publicly sympathized with Hamas and Hezbollah, accused Israel of genocide, and called for an Islamic alliance against Israel [09:16:00].

## Is Turkey a Leader?

These actions have led many to perceive [[Turkeys potential leadership in the Islamic world | Turkey as a leader within the Muslim world]] [09:31:00]. Headline figures support this possibility:
*   Turkey is the world's sixth most populous Muslim-majority state [09:44:00].
*   With an annual GDP of $1 trillion, it is the third-largest economically after Indonesia and Saudi Arabia [09:54:00].
*   Its military spending is second only to Saudi Arabia [10:04:00].

Beyond economic and military strength, Turkey's diplomatic, military, and aid presence across the Muslim world is growing, as is its soft power influence [10:09:00]. Turkish Airlines has expanded rapidly, and Istanbul has become the world's most connected airport [10:19:00]. Turkish television programs also command a following across many Muslim countries, complementing its active tourist market [10:30:00]. Turkish history and culture have been strongly promoted internationally [10:44:00]. Erdoğan's outspoken positions on key issues further boost Turkey's standing in the Muslim world [10:48:00].

However, there are reasons why this may not translate into formal political leadership [11:00:00]:
*   **Deep distrust in the Arab world**: Many Arab states, having experienced 300 years of Turkish Ottoman colonial rule, remain deeply suspicious of Turkey and its leader [11:06:00]. Turkey has also had bilateral tensions with states like Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates [11:24:00].
*   **Suspicion of multi-alignment**: Many are suspicious of Turkey's attempts to maintain ties with various blocs [11:54:00]. While courting Muslim states, it remains in [[Turkeys relationship with NATO and the EU | NATO]] with the West yet discusses joining the BRICS, which aims to undermine Western dominance [12:01:00]. Simultaneously, it seeks to lead the [[Turkeys role in the Turkic States and geopolitical ambitions | Turkic states]] while [[Turkeys evolving foreign relations especially with Russia and the US | cozying up to Russia]], a rival in Central Asia [12:13:00].
*   **Strong competition**: Turkey faces strong competition within the Arab world [12:37:00]. Saudi Arabia remains incredibly influential as the birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest sites [12:42:00]. Egypt is a demographic and cultural powerhouse [12:51:00]. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim state, followed by Pakistan [12:55:00]. Wealthy Gulf states like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have also emerged as influential actors [13:01:00]. For many Shia Muslims, Iran remains the preeminent actor [13:11:00].

For these reasons, while [[Turkeys potential leadership in the Islamic world | Turkey has undoubtedly reestablished its standing in the Muslim world]] under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it seems unlikely to become the overarching leader [13:16:00]. Instead, Turkey is better understood as one among many influential countries within this large and diverse group of states [13:35:00].

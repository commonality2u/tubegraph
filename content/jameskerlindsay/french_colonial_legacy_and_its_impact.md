New Caledonia, a Pacific island territory, has experienced significant unrest, raising questions about the ongoing impacts of [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French rule]] and [[history_of_colonialism_in_the_congo_and_surrounding_regions | colonialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. In May 2024, widespread rioting erupted in the territory, which has long sought independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This violence has led to concerns about a potential return to a sustained armed campaign against [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Global Context of Colonialism

Despite common perceptions that the era of [[history_of_colonialism_in_the_congo_and_surrounding_regions | colonialism]] is over, 17 places remain on the UN list of non-self-governing territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Of these, two remain under [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French rule]]: French Polynesia and New Caledonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## New Caledonia: A Detailed Case Study

### Geographic and Demographic Overview

New Caledonia is located in the South Pacific, approximately 1,300 km (800 miles) off Australia's east coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Its population is around 290,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, comprising three main groups:
*   Indigenous Melanesians (Kanaks): 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>
*   Europeans (mainly [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French]] origin): 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   Other immigrant communities (including Polynesians, Indonesians, Vietnamese): 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>

### Historical Context and French Annexation

While the Melanesians settled New Caledonia around 5,000 years ago, Captain James Cook was the first European to visit in 1774 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. [[Historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | France]] seized the territory in 1853, initially using it as a prison colony before other settlers arrived towards the end of the century as European [[colonial_history_of_cameroon | colonial powers]] expanded their control in the South Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Decolonization and Its Aftermath

Following the Second World War, New Caledonia was placed on the UN's list of non-self-governing territories in 1946, acknowledging its right to self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. In 1958, when [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | France]] offered its 20 overseas colonies a choice between a new constitution or independence, New Caledonia voted to remain under [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | France]] granted independence to 14 of these colonies two years later, New Caledonia remained a [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French]] territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Economic Impact and Rise of Pro-Independence Movement

The discovery of nickel deposits in the 1960s and the subsequent growth of mining made New Caledonia economically valuable and led to a further alteration of its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. More European immigrants arrived, and the island's prosperity attracted settlers from neighboring Polynesian states and elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. As the indigenous Kanak community became an increasingly impoverished minority, a pro-independence movement emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Referendums and Peace Agreements

In 1986, the UN General Assembly reinstated New Caledonia on its list of non-self-governing territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. An independence referendum in 1987 was boycotted by pro-independence forces due to the inclusion of newly arrived settlers in the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Tensions escalated, culminating in a hostage crisis that resulted in nearly 30 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

This led to the Matignon Agreement in 1988, which promised an independence vote ten years later and committed Paris to assist the Kanak community economically and socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In 1998, the Noumea Accord was reached, outlining a plan for up to three independence referendums between 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The accord also granted New Caledonia greater autonomy in many policy areas, recognized Kanak identity, and created New Caledonian citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Three referendums were held:
*   **November 4, 2018:** Voters rejected statehood by 56% to 44% with an 80% turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **October 4, 2020:** The margin tightened, with 53% against independence and 47% in favor, on an 86% turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **December 11, 2021:** Pro-independence forces boycotted this final vote, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Kanak community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The referendum proceeded, with 97% voting against independence on a 44% turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. [[Historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French]] President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the result, emphasizing [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | France]]'s continued presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Renewed Tensions and Strategic Importance

Despite the peace agreement allowing for further consultations, Paris indicated it would postpone any new vote for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This decision was influenced by New Caledonia's vital strategic importance, particularly with China's growing influence in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

In May 2024, [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French]] lawmakers passed new legislation extending the voter base to anyone resident in New Caledonia for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This was seen by pro-independence groups as a deliberate attempt to dilute their support and sparked widespread rioting among the Kanaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The unrest resulted in six deaths, numerous injuries, extensive property damage, and hundreds of arrests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. [[Historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | France]] responded by deploying thousands of police and banning TikTok, which it claimed was used to incite protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Costs of Continued French Rule

While order has largely been restored, deep resentment persists over issues of poverty, inequality, and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Although a major uprising may seem unlikely given the Kanak community is not a majority and [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | France]]'s resources, maintaining a large security presence will be costly both financially and diplomatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Any new insurgency would highlight continued [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French colonial rule]], which many perceive as being secured by a manipulated voter base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Allegations of External Interference

In a peculiar development, [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | France]] has accused Azerbaijan of stirring up the violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. An organization called the Baku Initiative Group, reportedly supported by the Azerbaijani government, aims to support [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French]] liberation and anti-colonialist movements in retaliation for [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French]] support for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While Azerbaijan denies the accusation, this highlights how hybrid strategies can emerge in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

The violent clashes in New Caledonia have unequivocally raised questions about the longer-term future of this strategically important Pacific territory under [[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

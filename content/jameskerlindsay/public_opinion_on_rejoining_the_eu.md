Following [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's exit from the European Union]] in January 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, public opinion has increasingly shifted against the decision, with polls showing a growing openness to rejoining the European Union (EU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This shift is primarily driven by mounting evidence of severe [[economic_impact_of_brexit | economic damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Seven years after the referendum, the issue of Europe continues to be central to British politics, with increasing calls to reconsider the decision to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Reasons for Shifting Sentiment

The initial hopes that [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Brexit]] would allow Britain to forge an independent place on the world stage have not materialised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, and the promised benefits by the Leave campaign have shown little sign of appearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Instead, several adverse effects have contributed to the change in public sentiment:

*   **Economic Downturn** Britain has experienced a significant economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Brexit]] has led to a four percent drop in British gross domestic product (GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Inflation and Cost of Living** A shortage of EU workers has contributed to rising inflation, leading to interest rate increases that have impacted the cost of living and mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Trade Difficulties** New regulations have made trade exceptionally difficult for many sectors, notably agriculture and fishing, despite these sectors largely favouring leaving the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. New trade deals with other countries have offered minimal benefits and do not offset the costs of reduced trade with the EU, the UK's largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Reduced Opportunities for Citizens** It is now significantly harder for British citizens to live and work across the continent, with many countries requiring special skills or independent financial means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Unfulfilled Domestic Promises** Few of the promised domestic benefits, such as increased spending on healthcare, have materialised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

These factors have led to growing public discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, with the latest polling indicating that a clear majority now believes [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Brexit]] was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Implications for Rejoining the EU

The widespread public regret raises questions about the possibility of reversing [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Brexit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Rejoining the EU would require Britain to go through a defined [[process_and_challenges_of_rejoining_the_eu | process of rejoining the EU]], which includes both procedural and political elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Public Commitment Requirement
A crucial factor for EU members considering Britain's re-entry is an unequivocal public commitment to membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. EU leaders would need assurance that any rejoining decision would be permanent, to avoid the trauma of another exit process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This public commitment could be demonstrated through:

*   An overwhelming victory for a pro-membership party in a general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   More likely, a referendum won by a significant margin in favour of membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Furthermore, EU leaders would expect a commitment to fundamental elements of EU membership that Britain previously opted out of, such as the euro and the Schengen Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Accepting these in principle would be a requirement, a potentially "tough pill" for many in Britain, even among those who support rejoining, due to strong commitment to the pound and political sensitivities around borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Future Prospects

Despite the swing in public opinion, rejoining the EU is not expected to happen in the immediate future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Neither of the main political parties, Labour or the Conservatives, will include rejoining in their manifestos for the next general election, due by January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The Labour Party, currently predicted to win the election, has stated its official policy is to try to make [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Brexit]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Assuming a full five-year parliamentary term, the earliest rejoining could feasibly be on the political agenda would be 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Even if talks were to begin with minimal divergence, the process could take at least two to three years to complete, followed by up to two additional years for ratification by member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This timeline suggests that 2035 would be the earliest possible re-entry under the most optimistic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Steps like joining EU programs and initiatives, most notably the Single Market, could be taken sooner to help rebuild trade and boost the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, this would involve a renewed commitment to accepting freedom of movement, which remains a politically sensitive issue for both major parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Overall, despite changing public opinion, Britain is unlikely to be ready, able, or willing to rejoin the EU for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

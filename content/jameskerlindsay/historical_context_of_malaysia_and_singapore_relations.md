Singapore, despite being one of the world's smallest countries, has emerged as a successful economic powerhouse due to its strategically vital location at a crossroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, its beginning was difficult, with its independence from Malaysia often considered a unique case of state creation in modern international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Singapore is frequently cited as the only state created by being forced out of another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While states typically resist territorial loss, and few accept breakaway regions, the concept of a state actively wanting to lose land is almost unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The most widely accepted example of this phenomenon in modern international politics is [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia]] in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Early History and British Influence

The island of Singapore is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It measures approximately 721 square kilometers (280 square miles), ranking 175th among the 193 United Nations members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Its current population is 5.45 million, comprising a diverse mix of national groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The largest community is ethnic Chinese, making up about three-quarters of the population, followed by Malays (15%) and ethnic Indians (7.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Europeans, Eurasians, and other communities constitute the remaining 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

While Singapore has a long history of settlement, its modern story began in 1819 when British official Sir Stamford Raffles established a trading post on the then sparsely inhabited island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Its location at a crucial junction between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean led to its growth, becoming the administrative center for British settlements on the Malay Peninsula along the strategically significant Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Over the following decades, Britain extended its influence over the peninsula, with various sultanates coming under its protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. By 1895, some of these were amalgamated into the Federated Malay States, alongside the Straits Settlements (including Singapore) and the Unfederated Malay States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Singapore's population grew rapidly from a couple of hundred in 1819 to over 10,000 within five years, reaching 225,000 by 1901 and over half a million by 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This growth was fueled by Malay and Indian immigration, but ethnic Chinese consistently formed the largest single community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

During World War II, the Malay Peninsula and Singapore were occupied by Japanese forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. After British rule resumed, the territories were reorganized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. On April 1, 1946, Singapore became a British Crown Colony, separate from the Straits Settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The remaining Straits Settlements, Federated, and Unfederated Malay States were amalgamated to form the Federation of Malaya on February 1, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This administrative separation meant Singapore now sat apart from the Malay Peninsula, achieving greater self-rule over the next decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | The Formation of Malaysia]]

As British decolonization progressed, questions about Singapore's future intensified, especially after the Federation of Malaya gained independence on August 31, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Despite its standalone status, many in Singapore believed its place was within the newly independent Federation, feeling that a small island couldn't survive independently, even if there was little obvious economic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

However, political leaders in the Federation were cautious about unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They worried about the demographic implications of Singapore's larger population, specifically the potential for 3.6 million Chinese to outnumber the 3.4 million Malays in a united country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Ultimately, wider political concerns, including an ongoing communist insurgency in the region, persuaded them, as there was a fear that Singapore might be overrun without protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

In April 1961, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's Prime Minister, proposed the creation of a new state: Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This new entity would comprise the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, and three other British territories on Borneo: Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Seven months later, in November 1961, the creation of the Federation of Malaysia was agreed upon in consultation with the British Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

A controversial referendum was held in Singapore on September 1, 1962, offering voters three options for integration but not on the merger itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Singaporeans chose considerable autonomy over a complete merger or a merger on equal terms with other new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The union details were outlined over the next year: Singapore would have representation in the federal administration, contribute to the state budget, and a common market would be established to ensure open trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

British rule officially ended on August 31, 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. On September 16, Singapore became one of the 14 states of the newly created Federation of Malaysia, alongside Sabah and Sarawak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Brunei, which was initially expected to join, opted to remain a British protectorate until its independence in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Difficulties within the Federation

From the outset, the union between Singapore and Malaysia proved challenging, both economically and politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Existing significant differences were magnified after Singapore joined the federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Singapore became dissatisfied with the failure to implement the common market, while Malaysia felt Singapore was not meeting its financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Furthermore, Malaysia's political leadership was angered by Singapore's ruling People's Action Party's decision to contest seats in Malaysia during the April 1964 general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party in the rest of the Federation, viewed this as an encroachment on their political territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Against this backdrop, [[ethnic_dynamics_in_singapore | ethnic tensions]] grew between Malays and Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This culminated in rioting in Singapore in July and September 1964, resulting in 36 deaths and over 550 injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. By the end of 1964, relations between Singaporean and Malaysian politicians and populations were under immense strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, stated that if Singapore's politicians continued on their path, the only solution was for Singapore to leave the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. He later proposed a confederation, granting Singapore full autonomy in all areas except defense and foreign policy, in exchange for giving up its seats in the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. However, discussions on this looser arrangement failed to produce a credible plan, and differences continued to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | Singapore's Expulsion from Malaysia]]

By July 1965, Rahman decided that the only remaining option was to force Singapore out of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. While this decision had the potential for major complications if Singapore had refused, Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, had also concluded that separation was the only viable way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Top-secret talks were held to discuss the terms of the "divorce," with many government members in both Malaysia and Singapore kept unaware of the negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Just weeks later, a deal was reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

On the morning of August 9, 1965, less than two years after joining Malaysia, a law for Singapore's separation was unanimously passed by the Malaysian parliament, surprising ordinary Malaysians and Singaporeans alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Rahman took personal responsibility for the decision, stating it was necessary for peace and that there had been no other choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Simultaneously, a visibly upset Lee Kuan Yew declared Singapore's independence, urging calm and promising a multi-ethnic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Six weeks later, on September 21, 1965, the Republic of Singapore became the 117th member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

Initially, the separation was widely regarded as a temporary measure based on differences between the main political forces, not a permanent parting due to fundamental incompatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:06]</a>. The door was left open for eventual reunification, with many at the time seeing it as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Rahman even stated that Singapore would be welcomed back and later expressed regret at its departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Similarly, Lee Kuan Yew also expressed regret and suggested that the next generation might bring about reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

However, reunification never occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Nearly 60 years later, there is no organized movement for reunification, though the idea is occasionally floated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Despite the separation, there was a persistent sense that Singapore's natural place was within the broader union of territories forming Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Malaysia's decision to expel Singapore remains one of the most interesting cases in modern international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Singapore's incorporation into Malaysia was never entirely comfortable, and despite common ties, fundamental political and economic differences quickly strained the union for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Ultimately, the situation was resolved peacefully and relatively easily, not as a dramatic expulsion but as a consensual mutual secession, as Singapore was ready to accept the decision and go its own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

In March 2024, authorities in the Moldovan breakaway region of [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] issued an urgent appeal to Russia for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This appeal comes amid growing speculation that Moldova might use the ongoing [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | war in Ukraine]] to regain control of the territory, which has been under Russia's protection for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Moscow has publicly warned that any use of force against [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] would be considered a direct attack on Russia itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context of Russian Influence

The [[historical_background_of_transnistria_and_moldova | historical background of Moldova and Transnistria]] shows a long-standing Russian involvement in the region. Following the Russo-Turkish War at the beginning of the 19th century, the Principality of Moldavia's eastern provinces, known as Bessarabia, were ceded to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Although the Kingdom of Romania later claimed control of Bessarabia, the area remained under Russian imperial rule until 1917 and the Russian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

After Bessarabia broke away and united with Romania in 1917, the newly formed Soviet Union refused to accept this incorporation and continued to claim the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. To this end, the USSR established the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Ukrainian SSR, operating from the east bank of the Dniester River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. On August 2, 1940, during World War II, Bessarabia and the Trans-Dniester (or [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]) area were merged to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, a new top-level republic of the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Following World War II, the Soviet leadership brought in ethnic Russians to control the new republic and reduce Romanian nationalist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. By the late 1980s, Ukrainians and Russians constituted about a quarter of Moldova's population, with many concentrated in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Russian Military Presence and Role as Guarantor

When [[moldovatransnistria_relations | clashes erupted between Moldovan and Transnistrian forces]] on March 2, 1992, Russian troops stationed in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The fighting lasted for four and a half months until a ceasefire was agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Under this agreement, the Russian Federation not only contributed troops to an international peacekeeping force but also maintained a separate military contingent in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], thereby becoming the "guarantor" of the new de facto state's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Despite calls from the UN General Assembly for their withdrawal, approximately 1,500 Russian troops remain in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Political and Economic Influence

For decades, the unresolved conflict benefited Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. As long as the conflict persisted, Moldova was prevented from moving closer to the West, as neither the EU nor NATO would be interested in admitting a divided state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Furthermore, [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] has little desire for a settlement that would mean giving up subsidies from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Some in Moldova feared that a settlement, particularly one that would integrate more Russian speakers, would strengthen Moscow's influence over the country's domestic affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | war in Ukraine]] significantly reshaped the status quo after 30 years of relative peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. There were initial fears that if Russian forces seized control of Ukraine, Moldova would become Moscow's next target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Concerns were heightened by a series of attacks in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] in mid-2022, which many viewed as a pretext for a Russian invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. There were also repeated suggestions that Russia was planning to overthrow the Moldovan government through mass demonstrations or a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated to the Russian Parliament that Russia would do everything to protect its 200,000 citizens living in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] and in Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Current Status and Perceived Waning Influence

Despite these assertions, the Moldovan government has dismissed the idea that Moscow could retaliate, arguing that Russia's military options have collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Indeed, with Russia cut off from [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], Moldova is becoming more assertive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

There are signs that Moscow's influence may be waning in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. For example, turnout for the recent Russian presidential election was significantly lower in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. At the same time, [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] may be slowly moving towards Europe, as trade with the European Union has increased significantly, now accounting for around 70% of [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]]'s imports and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

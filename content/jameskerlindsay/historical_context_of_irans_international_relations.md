International attention has recently focused on growing demonstrations across Iran, alongside a significant development in July and September 2022 when Iran's intelligence services orchestrated cyber attacks on Albania's critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This led to [[diplomatic_tensions_between_iran_and_albania | diplomatic relations]] being severed between Tirana and Tehran, new sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran, and widespread condemnation from NATO members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This incident highlights the evolving nature of conflict and Iran's complex position in global [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Iran's Profile

The Islamic Republic of Iran, located between the Middle East and Central Asia, is the 17th largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It has a population of nearly 90 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Approximately 90 to 95 percent of its population follows the Shia branch of Islam, in contrast to the Sunni Islam prevalent in much of the rest of the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## The Cold War Era and the Shah

During the Cold War, Persia (as Iran was then known) became an important Western ally due to its long border with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, the Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, led a corrupt and brutal regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Despite the secret police cracking down on dissent in the 1960s and 70s, opposition from religious conservatives, radicals, and communist groups steadily grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. By the late 1970s, mass protests, strikes, and armed insurgents challenged the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## The 1979 Revolution and its Impact

In January 1979, the Shah fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Days later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Tehran, becoming the Supreme Leader of the newly established Islamic Republic of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

The revolution profoundly transformed Iran:
*   **Internal Changes**: A theocratic political system was introduced, Islamic law was strictly enforced, and all opposition to the new regime was quickly purged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy Shift**: Iran's foreign policy changed dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   **Israel**: Long-standing ties with Israel were severed amidst calls for its destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   **Regional Tensions**: Fears grew that the new regime intended to export its revolution, raising tensions with the monarchies of the Gulf States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   **Iran-Iraq War**: This concern was a leading factor in neighbouring Iraq's decision to attack Iran in September 1980, sparking a bloody eight-year [[international_relations_and_war | war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   **Relations with the West**: Perhaps the most dramatic change was in relations with the West, particularly the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
        *   **Hostage Crisis**: Months after the revolution, the U.S. embassy in Tehran was stormed, leading to a 15-month hostage crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Though resolved peacefully, tensions grew between Iran and what it termed "the Great Satan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
        *   **State Sponsor of Terrorism**: In 1983, Washington held Iran responsible for bomb attacks on U.S. targets in Lebanon, which resulted in over 300 deaths, formally designating Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
        *   **"Axis of Evil"**: Despite a brief easing of tensions in the late 1990s, relations deteriorated again. In January 2002, President George W. Bush labeled Iran part of an "Axis of Evil," alongside North Korea and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK)

The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 marked the next stage in the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. U.S. forces discovered a large military camp belonging to an exiled Iranian militia, the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, known as MEK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### MEK's History

*   **Origins**: MEK emerged in the mid-1960s as part of the opposition to the Shah's rule, drawing on militant Islam, radical Marxism, and fierce anti-Americanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It opposed the regime and Western presence, even attacking U.S. citizens in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Post-Revolution**: Relations with the new theocratic regime collapsed immediately after the Revolution, leading to thousands of members being rounded up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The leadership fled to France before relocating to Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **In Iraq**: Iraq welcomed MEK during the Iran-Iraq [[international_relations_and_war | War]], providing Camp Ashraf, a large military base near the Iranian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Even after the [[international_relations_and_war | war]], MEK assisted Iraqi forces in suppressing [[iran_and_iraq_pressures_on_kurdistan | Kurdish insurgents]] in northern Iraq and continued its campaign against Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Terrorist Designation**: As part of a rapprochement with Iran in the late 1990s, and with Saddam Hussein's Iraq considered a pariah state, Washington and other Western countries listed MEK as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **U.S. Protection and Relocation**: The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq changed MEK's fortunes again, as the Bush Administration saw a chance to use it to undermine Iran, granting it formal U.S. protection despite its terrorist designation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. When Iraq's new administration (Kurds and Shia groups with ties to Iran) attacked MEK, Washington revoked its terrorist designation and sought to relocate the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Relocation to Albania

Albania, strongly pro-American following U.S. support for Kosovo's independence and a NATO member since 2009, agreed to accept MEK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Between 2014 and 2016, several thousand MEK members were airlifted to Albania, establishing a new base near the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Unable to maintain an armed insurgency, the group shifted tactics, setting up "troll farms" to conduct an online campaign against the Iranian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Cyber Attacks on Albania

This online campaign appears to have triggered Iran's cyber attacks against Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Planning began in early 2021 with infiltration of Albanian government systems, intensifying in May and June 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

*   **July 2022 Attack**: On July 15, "Homeland Justice," an Iranian state cyber actor, launched a ransomware attack that included anti-MEK messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. As Albanian authorities responded, a wave of destructive malware was unleashed, disrupting critical government services, medical appointments, school databases, and shutting down websites for the Prime Minister's office, Parliament, and the "e-Albania" online portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **September 2022 Attack**: Another attack in September focused on the police computer network, bringing down border control systems and causing large queues at entry points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama publicly blamed the Islamic Republic of Iran for the attacks, calling it an act of state aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. He announced the severance of [[diplomatic_tensions_between_iran_and_albania | diplomatic relations]] with Iran and the expulsion of all Iranian diplomats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

While Iran denied the allegations, Albania's allies rallied to its support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The United States condemned the attacks as a "troubling precedent for cyberspace" and imposed sanctions on the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and its minister for "malign cyber activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. NATO partners also condemned the attacks and pledged to support Albania's cyber defence capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Notably, Albania did not invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty concerning collective defense, with Prime Minister Rama stating he did not wish to escalate the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Implications for International Relations

This incident raises important questions about cyber warfare and appropriate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The preferred reaction currently seems to be low-key condemnation, sanctions, and cyber retaliation, with little appetite for conventional counter-attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The fact that cyber attacks can cause as much, if not more, damage than conventional weapons prompts questions about whether states feel they can act with impunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The attack also highlights the implications of supporting dissident groups in the contemporary era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Iran's cyber attack fits into a long history of states retaliating against countries that allow their territory to be used by armed insurgencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While Albania may be justified in hosting MEK given Iran's history of sponsoring terrorism, such support carries significant risks, even at a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. The cyber attack on Albania, though receiving little international attention, raises profoundly important questions about the evolution of conflict in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

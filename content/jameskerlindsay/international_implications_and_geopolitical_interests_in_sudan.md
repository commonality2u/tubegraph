Fierce fighting erupted in Sudan in April 2023, raising fears that the country has been plunged into yet another [[recent_fighting_in_sudan_and_potential_new_civil_war | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This conflict, centered on competing military factions, has broader international implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The situation in Sudan has garnered significant international attention, especially due to the fighting in Khartoum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Historical International Involvement

Sudan's long history includes significant foreign influence:
*   The area was partially conquered by ancient Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   The Ottoman Empire, with an Egyptian Army, established control over the region at the start of the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   In 1881, Britain sent troops into Sudan, fearing a local uprising could spread into Egypt and destabilize Anglo-French colonial power in North Africa and the Middle East, bringing Sudan under British rule while Egypt formally remained sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Britain hastily withdrew in 1956, leading to Sudan's immediate immersion into civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   During the Second Sudanese Civil War, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) received support from neighboring Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, the fall of Ethiopia's military dictatorship in 1991 deprived the SPLA of this crucial supporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   Following the 9/11 attacks, then-President Omar al-Bashir worried his regime might become a target for the United States in its fight against Islamic extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   Confronted with two uprisings and growing international condemnation, Bashir agreed to US-led talks with the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   The UN and the African Union established a joint peacekeeping force in Darfur in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2009 for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Recent Geopolitical Interests and Alignments

In recent years, international actors have continued to play a role in Sudan's political landscape:
*   Following Bashir's overthrow in 2019, international pressure led the military to agree to share power under a joint Transitional Sovereignty Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   The military coup in October 2021 was widely condemned, with calls for the transition to civilian rule and democracy to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   By December 2022, intensive international efforts aimed at a two-year transitional arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   Current competing generals are aligned with different geopolitical actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>:
    *   General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan is regarded as closer to the United States and has the support of neighboring Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
    *   General Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo (Hemeti) is seen to have close links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Reasons for International Significance

The current fighting in Sudan has received significant international coverage for several reasons:
*   Thousands of foreigners, particularly Europeans, have been caught up in the fighting, leading countries like Britain, France, and Germany to attempt to evacuate their citizens, sometimes deploying military units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   There are critical geopolitical and economic factors at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   Despite its poverty and instability, Sudan possesses mineral resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Sudan is an essential strategic gateway between the Middle East and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   Its coastline on the Red Sea gives it control over one of the most crucial waterways in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   The alignment of competing generals with different geopolitical actors adds an extra dimension to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

For these reasons, the United States, China, Russia, and the European Union are closely monitoring the situation in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The ongoing conflict marks the latest tragic chapter for a country that has been in a state of conflict for almost its entire history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

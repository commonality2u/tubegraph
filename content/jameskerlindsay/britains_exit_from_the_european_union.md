On 31 January 2020, Britain formally left the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While initially hailed as an opportunity for independence on the world stage, the promised benefits of the Leave campaign have largely failed to materialise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Instead, there is mounting evidence of severe [[economic_impact_of_brexit | economic damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, and [[public_opinion_on_rejoining_the_eu | public opinion is increasingly turning against the decision]] and becoming open to rejoining the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Historical Context of Britain's Relationship with Europe

[[historical_relationship_between_britain_and_europe | Britain's relationship with Europe has a long history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, shaped by waves of immigration from the continent (Celts, Romans, Saxons, Vikings, Danes, Normans, Huguenots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Over centuries, Britain has been intimately linked to the continent politically, economically, militarily, and socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### European Integration

The story of modern European integration began on 23 July 1952, with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community by France and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This was followed by the Treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957, which created the European Economic Community (EEC), built on the idea of an "ever-closer union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This eventually evolved into the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Britain was initially ambivalent about this integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, preferring to focus on rebuilding post-war ties to the Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, by the early 1960s, Britain's position on the world stage had changed, losing its preeminent place in international affairs and falling behind Western Europe economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In 1961, Britain applied to join the EEC, but this was rejected twice by French President Charles de Gaulle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Britain Joins the EEC

With a change in French leadership, the UK finally joined the EEC on 1 January 1973, alongside Ireland and Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Complicated Membership

From the outset, Britain's relationship with the EEC was complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Britain joined primarily for economic benefits, not political integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Although membership was overwhelmingly endorsed in a 1975 referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, tensions grew in the 1980s. Britain led the way in forming the Single Market but secured an unpopular rebate on its contributions due to funding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher became increasingly opposed to greater political integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Even under a pro-European Labour government in the late 1990s, deep-rooted hostility towards Europe in the media persisted, and the government stood back from major European projects like the euro and Schengen (border-free Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## The Decision to Leave

The issue came to a head in 2014 following a disastrous result for the Conservatives in European parliamentary elections, where the anti-European UK Independence Party (UKIP) won on a campaign centred on European immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. In response, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hold a referendum on EU membership if the Conservatives won the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

After a surprise Conservative victory in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, negotiations to amend Britain's membership terms included a commitment that Britain would not be bound by an "ever-closer union" or required to join the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This led to a highly divisive debate:
*   **Remain Campaign:** Focused on economic benefits and argued leaving would have disastrous consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Leave Campaign:** Dismissed economic warnings, focusing on sovereignty and limiting immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. They argued Brexit would restore independence and allow more money for public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

On 23 June 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union by 52% to 48% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## The Exit Process (Brexit)

After the vote, the country debated the form of Brexit. The government pursued a "hard Brexit," cutting ties to all parts and institutions of the European Union, rather than remaining in the Single Market due to the political unacceptability of continued freedom of movement for European workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Triggering Article 50 (the EU's clause for leaving), negotiations took several years and were marked by acrimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Brexit also raised severe problems in Northern Ireland, where EU membership underpinned the 1998 Good Friday Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Despite this, a deal was reached by the end of 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, and the UK formally left on 31 January 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Consequences of Brexit

Since leaving, Brexit has not delivered on the Leave campaign's promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **[[economic_impact_of_brexit | Economic Downturn]]**: Britain has experienced a significant economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates Brexit has led to a 4% drop in British GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Inflation and Cost of Living**: A shortage of EU workers has contributed to inflation, leading to interest rate increases that impact the cost of living and mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Trade Difficulties**: New rules have made trade difficult for many sectors, including agriculture and fishing, which largely favoured leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. New trade deals with other countries have offered minimal benefits and do not offset the cost of Brexit to trade with the EU, the UK's largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Movement Restrictions**: It is now much harder for British citizens to live and work across the continent, with many countries requiring special skills or independent financial means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Unfulfilled Domestic Promises**: Few of the promised domestic benefits, such as more spending on healthcare, have appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This has led to [[public_opinion_on_rejoining_the_eu | growing public discontent]], with polls showing a clear majority now believe Brexit was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Prospects of Rejoining the EU

Britain cannot simply reverse Brexit; it would have to rejoin the EU, which involves a defined [[process_and_challenges_of_rejoining_the_eu | two-part process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>:

1.  **Procedural Element**: The UK must realign with the EU's body of laws, the *acquis communautaire* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This is considered the easier part, given Britain's long history as a member and relatively few divergences since leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
2.  **Political Decision**: The more difficult aspect will be the political decision by existing members to accept Britain back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. EU leaders would want assurance of Britain's permanent commitment to membership to avoid another exit process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This would require:
    *   **Unequivocal Public Commitment**: Shown through an overwhelming victory for a pro-membership party in a general election or, more likely, a referendum won by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   **Commitment to Key EU Elements**: Britain would likely need to sign up to the euro and Schengen in principle, even if not immediately joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This would be a tough pill for many in Britain, given strong commitment to the pound and political sensitivities around borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Timeline for Rejoining

Even if [[public_opinion_on_rejoining_the_eu | public opinion firmly swings behind rejoining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, rejoining is not likely to happen any time soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Neither Labour nor the Conservatives will put rejoining on their manifestos for the next general election (due by January 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The Labour Party's official policy is to try to make Brexit work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Assuming a full five-year parliamentary term, the earliest rejoining would feasibly be on the political agenda is 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The [[process_and_challenges_of_rejoining_the_eu | talks]] themselves could take at least two to three years, followed by up to two more years for ratification by member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Under the most optimistic scenario, rejoining would not happen before 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Before full rejoining, Britain could take steps like joining EU programs and initiatives, most importantly the Single Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. While this would boost trade and the economy, it would come with a renewed commitment to freedom of movement, which may still be too politically sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Ultimately, Britain is unlikely to be ready, able, or willing to rejoin the European Union for a long time yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

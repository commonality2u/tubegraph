Recent months have seen growing concern over [[increasing_military_activity_in_the_south_china_sea|China's increasing military activity]] around the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Spratly Islands]] in the South China Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has fueled renewed concerns about the [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea|possibility of an armed conflict]] in an area claimed by no less than six different actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Nature of the Dispute

Territorial disputes often revolve around maritime boundaries, involving competing claims over territorial waters and exclusive economic zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. When countries contest islands, control over a small territory can lead to significantly extended maritime and airspace rights over a vast area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Spratly Islands]] are a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] themselves are largely uninhabited, comprising over a hundred tiny islets, reefs, and atolls, many of which are wholly or partially submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Despite their small size, they cover a vast area of around 400,000 square kilometers (160,000 square miles), making them valuable militarily, economically, and strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. By claiming the territory, countries can control territorial waters and undersea resources across much of the region, including one of the world's most important shipping lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The area also grants access to significant fishing banks and is believed to contain oil and gas deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## China's Historical Claims

The history of the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Spratly Islands]] is believed to date back almost 2,000 years, having been first discovered by Chinese fishermen and later mentioned in Imperial Chinese records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. At that time, they were seemingly understood to be an extension of the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Paracel Islands]] to their north, which are also subject to a separate dispute involving [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|China]], [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Taiwan]], and [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions|Vietnam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

While European colonial powers like Spain, France, and Britain made claims or visited the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] from the 16th to 19th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, the question of sovereignty intensified after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   In 1947, the Republic of China (later based in [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Taiwan]]) published a map indicating the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Spratly Islands]] as part of Chinese territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   The Communist People's Republic of China, established in 1949, also claimed the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] as part of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

In the decades that followed, broader regional competition grew, with [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Vietnam]] and the [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Philippines]] also claiming sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The issue escalated as various countries began establishing small military presences on the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

In the late 1980s, after a violent clash with [[china_vietnam_relations_and_south_china_sea_tensions|Vietnam]] in 1988, China began an ambitious scheme to reclaim land around the reefs and atolls to create artificial [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This activity dramatically increased in 2013, with an estimated 13 square kilometers (five square miles) of land reclaimed over the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## International Law and the Arbitration Case

China's increasingly assertive claims led to growing pushback from other countries, including the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. In 2013, the [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Philippines]] referred China's claims to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

The [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Philippines]] argued that Beijing had no right to claim sovereignty over the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] simply by virtue of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Instead, any claim should be judged based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which is the key [[role_of_international_law_in_border_conflicts|international treaty governing maritime issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Although China refused to participate in the proceedings and disputed the Court's jurisdiction, the case proceeded as both countries were parties to the Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### The PCA Ruling (2016)

The PCA's judges did not try to decide who had sovereignty over the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]], as land territories are not subject to UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Nor did they try to determine how maritime boundaries should be delineated, as that would depend on agreed sovereignty over the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Instead, the Court focused on which states had a claim to rights within the waters and on what grounds, specifically addressing whether historical relationships or [[role_of_international_law_in_border_conflicts|international law]] (UNCLOS) should prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

In its detailed ruling, the Court went against China's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>:
*   It argued that rights to the maritime zones should be based on UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   It found that China's actions in and around the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]], including land reclamation, had aggravated the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   It ruled that Beijing had infringed on the [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Philippines']] rights within its exclusive economic zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Crucially, the Court ruled that none of the so-called [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Spratly Islands]] were in fact "islands" as generally understood under the terms of the Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Therefore, even if China had sovereignty over the territory, it would not confer an exclusive economic zone under UNCLOS that would infringe on the rights of other states in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   The Court called on both parties to comply with the terms of the Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## China's Rejection and Continuing Tensions

As expected, China refused to accept the ruling and continues to fundamentally reject the findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson recently called the arbitration case "pure political drama" orchestrated by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The Chinese government also refuses to take the issue of the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|ownership of the islands]] before another legal body, such as the International Court of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

In the meantime, tensions have continued to rise as Beijing steadily builds up its presence on the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Despite earlier assurances by Chinese President Xi Jinping that China would not militarize the territory further, reports indicate that military bases have been constructed on three of the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Several other claimants have also become more active. For instance, [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Vietnam]] has reportedly begun dredging parts of the territory, creating around 220 hectares of new land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Malaysia]] also controls a reef it captured in the 1980s, which has since been converted into an [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|island]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Of the six claimants, only [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Brunei]] does not have a presence on the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Even [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Indonesia]], though not a claimant, has publicly challenged China's claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Recent incidents, such as a Chinese Coast Guard vessel allegedly harassing a [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Philippine]] vessel with a military-grade laser in February 2023, have further fueled tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Philippines]] now accuses China of threatening its sovereignty and security, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. suggesting that the Armed Forces of the [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Philippines]] must reorient their mission against Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Spratly Islands]] dispute is an exceedingly complex issue with many countries claiming some or all of the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|islands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. While UNCLOS provides clarity on the subject, the model for resolution would essentially leave out China and [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Taiwan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. This creates the current dilemma: how far China is willing to push its highly disputed claim, and how far other states are prepared to defend their positions, even if it means an [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea|armed confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. Despite international attention often focusing on a potential Chinese invasion of [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|Taiwan]], the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands|Spratly Islands]] may be a more likely focal point for [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea|conflict]] in the period ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. With the sheer number of [[role_of_regional_actors_in_the_south_china_sea_conflict|actors involved]], this collection of rocks, reefs, and atolls could become the center of a bitter regional war if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.

In April 2023, [[recent_fighting_in_sudan_and_potential_new_civil_war | fierce fighting erupted in Sudan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This conflict, unlike [[historical_context_of_sudans_conflicts | previous conflicts]] that have plagued the country, is centered on competing factions within Sudan's military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Fears are growing that the country has been plunged into yet another [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Historical Context of Military Involvement

Long-running conflicts can profoundly shape and change countries, often leading to the militarization of society and the domination of politics by the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. As armies grow more powerful, they may intervene and take control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Similarly, paramilitary bodies can emerge as significant players, occasionally leading to tensions and even outright conflict with the regular army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Sudan's [[historical_background_to_sudan_conflict | exceptionally long history]] includes periods of significant conflict, shaping its political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The current situation marks the latest tragic chapter for a country that has been in a state of conflict for almost its entire history, giving the military a seemingly permanent place in the country's politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Key Factions and Leaders

The current fighting in Sudan is between two main military factions:
*   The **Armed Forces**, led by General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   The **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)**, commanded by General Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Origins of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)
The RSF originated from the Janjaweed, a local Arab militia that supported the military's brutal campaign of repression in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. In 2013, the Janjaweed became the RSF and was nominally placed under the command of the armed forces, though it maintained a separate leadership structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This history is crucial for understanding the current situation in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Escalation of Tensions

Following the fall of Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 after 30 years in power, hopes for democratic civilian rule were short-lived as the Armed Forces made it clear they would remain in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. After international pressure, the military agreed to share power under a joint Transitional Sovereignty Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This council included General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, the Armed Forces Commander, and his deputy, General Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo, the commander of the RSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, resentment grew among many Sudanese who felt their hopes for a proper democratic government had been thwarted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. As new protests emerged, on October 25, 2021, the military leadership staged another coup, dissolving the Sovereignty Council, arresting the prime minister, and putting power back in the hands of Burhan and Dagalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:05]</a>. This takeover was widely condemned, with calls for a transition to civilian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

By December 2022, intensive international efforts seemed to be leading to a deal for a two-year transitional arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, a final agreement expected in April 2023 was thwarted at the last minute due to a growing power struggle within the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Reasons for the Power Struggle

Although Burhan and Dagalo appeared united after the late 2021 takeover, and had known each other since the Darfur days, their relationship became increasingly strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Factors contributing to this included:
*   **Policy Differences and Personal Ambitions**: Both generals had differing policies and strong political ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Dagalo, actively campaigning for support, openly called the 2021 coup a mistake, referring to it as "a gateway for the return of the former regime," and painted Burhan as a radical Islamist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Social Factors**: Reports suggested that many traditional Sudanese elites, predominantly from the north and northeast, rejected the idea of Dagalo, a provincial Darfurian, taking control as leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Wealth Allegations**: Allegations emerged that Dagalo had accumulated considerable wealth by appropriating gold mines in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **International Alignments**: Broader international factors also played a part. Burhan was seen as closer to the United States and had the support of neighboring Egypt, while Dagalo was perceived to have close links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This reflects [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | broader international implications and geopolitical interests in Sudan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Current Status and Outlook

The power struggle erupted into open clashes on April 15, 2023, between the Army and the RSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This fighting has resulted in hundreds killed, thousands wounded, and a mass exodus from the capital, Khartoum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

The situation remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Although several ceasefires have been brokered, they have all quickly collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. With little hope for reconciliation between the two generals, there is a significant fear that this is on its way to becoming yet another bloody and protracted [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Meanwhile, many ordinary Sudanese desire both generals out of the picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The fighting in Sudan has received significant international coverage, partly because thousands of foreigners, especially Europeans, have been caught up in the fighting, prompting evacuation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. However, critical geopolitical and economic factors are also at play, given Sudan's mineral resources, its strategic gateway position between the Middle East and Africa, and its control over one of the world's most crucial waterways via the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The alignment of the competing generals with different geopolitical actors adds another dimension to the situation, with the United States, China, Russia, and the European Union all closely monitoring the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This makes the conflict significant, distinguishing it from other regional conflicts, such as the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | recent two-year civil war in neighbouring Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

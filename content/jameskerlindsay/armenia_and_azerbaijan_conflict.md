On November 9, 2020, [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Armenia and Azerbaijan]] reached a peace agreement concerning the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, following a brief but intense conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While Azerbaijan declared the end of the issue, the agreement raised several important questions about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Background of the Conflict

The dispute primarily centers on the Nagorno-Karabakh region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Historical Context** Nagorno-Karabakh is predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians but was part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. As the Soviet Union dissolved, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1990s)** This declaration triggered a bitter war between [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Armenia and Azerbaijan]], which resulted in Armenian forces controlling Nagorno-Karabakh and several surrounding Azerbaijani districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Previous Peace Efforts** In the years that followed, Russia, the United States, and France led efforts to resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Principles for a resolution included:
    *   Return of surrounding districts to Azerbaijan's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   A land link between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   An agreement on Nagorno-Karabakh's future status, confirmed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   Implementation of security measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    Despite apparent agreement on broad terms, a final deal was never reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Escalation to War** The situation increasingly pointed to a return to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Azerbaijan significantly increased military spending, raising fears of a forceful retake of territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Small-scale incidents and major confrontations occurred frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   A four-day conflict in 2016 resulted in hundreds of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   Another serious skirmish took place in July 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## The 2020 Conflict

Full-scale fighting erupted between [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Azerbaijan and Armenia]] on September 27, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The war, a [[2020_armenia_azerbaijan_war_impact | much shorter conflict than expected]], lasted only six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Azerbaijani Advance** Azerbaijan rapidly advanced into Armenian-held territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. While the exact initiator is disputed, Azerbaijan quickly used the opportunity to retake territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In the following month, Azerbaijan recaptured most southern territories of Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. By early November, Armenian forces were clearly losing, as Azerbaijani forces entered Nagorno-Karabakh proper and seized its second-largest town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Azerbaijan appeared poised to overrun the remaining Armenian forces and retake all of Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## The 2020 Peace Agreement

On the evening of November 9, 2020, Russia announced it had brokered a peace agreement between the leaders of [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Armenia and Azerbaijan]], bringing an immediate end to the fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Terms of the Agreement
The most significant aspects of the [[impact_of_the_peace_agreement_on_armenia_and_azerbaijan | peace agreement]] include:
*   **Territorial Control**
    *   Azerbaijan regained control of all districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   By December 1, Armenia agreed to hand over any remaining territory under its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   Azerbaijan retained control of areas within Nagorno-Karabakh captured before the ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   Armenia committed to withdrawing all its armed forces from Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Transport Links**
    *   Armenia maintained a direct transport link with Nagorno-Karabakh, with Azerbaijan guaranteeing the safety of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   A significant development for Azerbaijan, a new road will be built across Armenian territory to connect the main part of Azerbaijan with its western exclave, Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This ends Azerbaijan's reliance on air links or a road through [[iran_azerbaijan_relations_and_tensions | Iran]] to Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Provisions**
    *   All internally displaced persons were allowed to return to their properties in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, overseen by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   An exchange of prisoners of war and other detainees, and the return of bodies of those killed, was agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Russian Peacekeepers**
    *   The agreement is guaranteed by [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   Approximately 2,000 Russian troops are stationed along the ceasefire line for an initial period of five years, with an automatic extension for another five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Russian troops and border guards also control the corridors between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and between Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Outcomes and Implications

### For Azerbaijan
The [[impact_of_the_peace_agreement_on_armenia_and_azerbaijan | peace agreement]] represents a huge victory for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Having been defeated in the early 1990s, Azerbaijan felt it had restored its honor by retaking territories around and within Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. President Ilham Aliyev declared the districts and Karabakh itself "liberated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The securing of a land link to Nakhchivan further emphasized the scale of the Azerbaijani win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Azerbaijan's decision not to press on and retake all territory, despite its commanding position, was likely due to three reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>:
1.  Uncertainty of continued smooth war progress, especially with winter approaching, potentially making it prolonged and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
2.  Key goals had been achieved: surrounding districts returned, and Nagorno-Karabakh no longer posed a credible separatist threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
3.  Allowing Nagorno-Karabakh to continue to exist provided a bargaining chip for the land corridor with Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### For Armenia
The [[impact_of_the_peace_agreement_on_armenia_and_azerbaijan | agreement]] was a devastating defeat for [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated it was "not a victory, but there is no defeat until you consider yourself defeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. However, Armenia had no choice but to surrender, as continuation of military action would have led to the loss of all of Nagorno-Karabakh and many more casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The outcome caused shock and anger among many Armenians, leading to protests and calls for the prime minister's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Despite the dire situation, the outcome was not a complete disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The feared prospect of Azerbaijani troops completely overrunning Nagorno-Karabakh and potential ethnic cleansing was averted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Crucially, enough of Nagorno-Karabakh remains viable for future talks between Yerevan and Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Regional Implications
Two other major winners emerged from this situation: [[regional_implications_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_agreement | Turkey]] and [[regional_implications_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_agreement | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

*   **Turkey** Turkey expressed delight, calling the result a "sacred success" for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Turkey openly sided with Baku and its president strengthened his credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The new land corridor across Armenia will create a direct road link between Ankara and Baku, strengthening close economic, political, and ethnic ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Russia** Russia's role was particularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Initially, Moscow's response was unclear, despite its defense agreement with Armenia and Turkish involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, Russia aimed to maintain its position as a regional hegemon and avoid alienating Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Russia chose its moment to intervene carefully, maximizing its advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The agreement came at a perfect time:
    *   Any sooner would have damaged ties with victorious Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   Any later, with Nagorno-Karabakh completely lost, would have removed Russia's leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   Had Nagorno-Karabakh fallen, Armenians might have blamed Moscow for not intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
    As it stands, Armenia continues to rely on Moscow to help retain what it still holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The presence of Russian peacekeepers in Azerbaijan also extends Russia's regional footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook

In the immediate [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | future]], efforts will focus on ensuring the terms of the peace agreement are met, promised exchanges completed, and IDPs can return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Looking further ahead, the continued existence of Nagorno-Karabakh, protected by Russian peacekeepers, means it remains an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. However, the nature of future discussions will change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   Nagorno-Karabakh's hopes of consolidating independent statehood are now over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   The prospect of extensive autonomy within Azerbaijan appears unlikely for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   President Aliyev stated there would be "no status of any sort for Nagorno-Karabakh," adding, "They wanted independence. They were offered autonomy. Now they get nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   While Baku may not immediately concede on status, discussions on options might occur in the future, possibly as part of a final comprehensive settlement with Armenia, including trade-offs for consolidating the corridor between Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This, however, is likely "further down the road" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Despite Azerbaijan winning the war, the dispute is not yet over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Russia's intervention keeps the issue "in limbo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. While the Nagorno-Karabakh republic no longer exists as a de facto state, important loose ends remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The question remains whether [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Armenia and Azerbaijan]] can reach an overall political settlement, or if Russia, and perhaps Turkey, will try to keep the dispute "on ice indefinitely" to maintain regional leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

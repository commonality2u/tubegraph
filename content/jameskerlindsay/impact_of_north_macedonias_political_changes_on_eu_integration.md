The pursuit of European Union (EU) membership by [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|North Macedonia]] has been significantly shaped by its relationship with Greece, particularly concerning the country's name and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A landmark peace agreement in 2018, known as the [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|Prespa Agreement]], resolved a three-decade dispute with Greece and was seen as central to [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|North Macedonia]]'s future EU integration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, [[recent_political_developments_in_north_macedonia|recent political changes in North Macedonia]] in May 2024 have cast doubt on the durability of this agreement and, by extension, the country's EU aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Prespa Agreement: A Prerequisite for EU Path

[[North Macedonia]] declared independence on December 8, 1991, following the collapse of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. From the outset, Greece objected to the country's name, "Republic of Macedonia," arguing that it claimed its own region of Macedonia and usurped historical Greek identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. With the support of its European Union partners, Greece ensured that when the new country joined the UN in April 1993, it did so under the provisional name, "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," or FYROM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Despite an interim agreement in 1995 where [[North Macedonia]] agreed to change contentious symbols in return for Greece not obstructing its international organization efforts, the name issue remained unresolved for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Greece continued to object to the terms "Macedonian" for the country's language and inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. As a result, Athens blocked [[North Macedonia]]'s efforts to join NATO and the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The breakthrough came in 2017 with new governments in both Skopje and Greece committed to resolving the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|Prespa Agreement]], signed on June 19, 2018, officially renamed the country the "Republic of North Macedonia," to be used in all circumstances, domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The agreement stipulated the language would remain "Macedonian," and inhabitants could call themselves "Macedonians" while officially being "citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. It also explicitly recognized the distinct Greek and Slavic heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|Prespa Agreement]] was hailed internationally as a significant step forward for both countries and the wider Balkan region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Crucially, it opened the way for [[North Macedonia]] to join NATO, which it did on March 27, 2020, as the organization's 30th member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. While Greece dropped its veto over EU integration, new obstacles emerged from [[Bulgaria and North Macedonia EU accession dispute|Bulgaria]], which presented its own demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Recent Political Developments and Renewed Concerns

In May 2024, [[recent_political_developments_in_north_macedonia|North Macedonia]] held parliamentary and presidential elections, resulting in a significant victory for the right-wing opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, the party's candidate, won the presidency with two-thirds of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

During her inauguration on May 12, 2024, President Siljanovska-Davkova refused to use the official oath of office with the term "Republic of [[North Macedonia]]," instead using "Republic of Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This action was a direct challenge to the [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|Prespa Agreement]], which she had campaigned against, viewing it as a betrayal of national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Implications for EU Accession

The new president's stance immediately triggered a diplomatic response:
*   The Greek Ambassador walked out of the ceremony in protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   The Greek foreign ministry condemned the move as a violation of the [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|Prespa Agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   Within hours, senior EU officials stressed that [[North Macedonia]]'s progress toward full European integration depended on its adherence to the agreement with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Potential Outcomes
The question remains whether the president's action was a personal provocative step or an indication of a formal revocation of the agreement by the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Formal Abandonment Unlikely**: It seems unlikely that the government will attempt to formally abandon the [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement|Prespa Agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Doing so would immediately halt any further EU accession talks, not only due to renewed Greek opposition but also from many other EU members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Given that EU accession remains a stated core goal for the country, a complete abandonment would contradict this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Internal politics, requiring a constitutional change to undo the deal, also make a formal break difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Undermining the Agreement**: While a formal break is improbable, the new government could still undermine the agreement in other ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. For example, it might refer to "the Republic of Macedonia" in non-official statements and documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Such actions, even if not a letter-of-the-law violation, would go against the spirit of the agreement, potentially prompting Greece and the EU to push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

The dispute over the name issue, once thought settled, now appears to be back on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This renewed controversy will likely continue to complicate [[North Macedonia]]'s path towards full EU integration, necessitating careful diplomatic navigation from Skopje to balance its national identity concerns with its strategic EU aspirations.

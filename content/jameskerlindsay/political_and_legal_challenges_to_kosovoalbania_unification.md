In recent months, there has been renewed discussion about the [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification of Kosovo with neighbouring Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This idea has been openly raised by former prime ministers of Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the logic behind such a move may seem understandable, it faces significant obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Background to Unification Talks

[[kosovo_declaration_of_independence_and_international_response | Kosovo's declaration of independence]] in February 2008 divided international opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The United States and most of the European Union recognized its independence, but many other countries, including Russia and China, remain opposed to its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. As a result, 13 years after breaking away from Serbia, Kosovo remains outside the United Nations, and its aspirations of joining the European Union are on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This backdrop has led to growing discussions among senior Kosovar political figures about uniting with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Albin Kurti, leader of VetÃ«vendosje and winner of recent elections in Kosovo, stated his support for unification and would vote for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister, suggested that if Kosovo's hopes for European integration remain blocked, a referendum on unification might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Such a suggestion, however, carries significant [[legal_and_political_arguments_regarding_kosovos_independence | legal and political implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Reasons for Unification Discussions

Several reasons underpin the current discussions over unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>:

*   **National Identity**: Many view the unification of all Albanian territories, sometimes referred to as 'Natural Albania' or 'Greater Albania', as a national aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, there's also a more cautious approach, focusing on closer unity between Albania and Kosovo as overwhelmingly Albanian countries with a free will to unite, rather than an overtly expansionist message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Practical Realities**: The pace of [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | recognitions for Kosovo]] has slowed dramatically since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Kosovo's path to full international acceptance, particularly UN membership, is blocked by Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Unifying with Albania could indirectly integrate Kosovo into the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Pressure on EU Integration**: Talk of unification also serves as a means to apply pressure on countries to unblock Kosovo's path to EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This path is stalled due to opposition from five EU members that do not recognize Kosovo and general concerns about Western Balkan enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Political and Legal Challenges

Despite the discussions, the [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification of Kosovo and Albania]] faces significant political and legal challenges.

### Popular Support Nuances
While recent polls suggest strong support for unification (75% in Albania, 64% in Kosovo in 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, this support is more mixed when practicalities are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. For example, support drops significantly if people are asked if they would pay a tax to support it (29% in Albania, 44% in Kosovo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Many Kosovar Albanians fear taking a secondary position if the national heartland became Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The form of union (unitary state, federation, or confederation) would also need to be clearly defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Constitutional Blockages
Kosovo's constitution explicitly outlaws union with another state in its very first article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. A constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds vote in the 120-member parliament and two-thirds support from the 20 members representing national minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Given that 10 of these minority members are ethnic Serbs, it is considered "completely implausible" that they, or other minority deputies, would vote for unification with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. From this perspective alone, unification appears to be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### International Opposition
Even if constitutional hurdles could be overcome, international efforts would be made to prevent unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>:

*   **Non-recognizing States**: Countries that do not recognize Kosovo's independence, such as Serbia, Russia, and China, would view such a move as a violation of Serbia's territorial integrity and unlawful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Recognizing States' Concerns**: For countries that have recognized Kosovo, the concern is the wider regional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. There is a strong fear that unification would trigger a chain reaction across the Western Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
    *   This could lead to pressure for unification from Albanians in [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | North Macedonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   If Albanians were seen to have the right to unite, it could lead to similar demands from Serbs in the region, posing a challenge to Bosnia and Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_kosovo_on_other_separatist_movements | impact of Kosovo on other separatist movements]] and broader [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | international relations and conflicts]].
    *   The countries that supported Kosovo's independence did so on the explicit understanding that this would be the final redrawing of borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Any attempt at unification would face immense pressure from the United States and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

Talk of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification between Kosovo and Albania]] has gained international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. However, it seems highly unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Beyond the constitutional blockages within Kosovo, any attempt would face fierce opposition from the international community, including both states that don't recognize Kosovo and those that do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Such discussions are primarily a strategy to encourage greater international engagement to break the deadlock over Kosovo's [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | international standing]] as an independent state, rather than a genuine attempt to abandon that independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Nevertheless, the longer Kosovo remains in limbo, the louder these calls for unification may grow, potentially tempting politicians to act despite the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

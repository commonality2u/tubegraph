Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country, has a long history and has endured significant periods of conflict, despite recent hopes for an era of prosperity and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | Historical Context]]

Once known as Abyssinia, Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and maintained its independence during the European scramble for Africa in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. It was one of only four African states to be a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The country has a diverse population of 115 million, comprising over 80 distinct ethnic groups and languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The largest ethnic groups are the Oromo (approx. 35%), Amhara (approx. 27%), Somalis (approx. 6%), and Tigrayans (approx. 6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## The Derg Era and Civil War (1974-1991)

The roots of current tensions lie in a protracted [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | civil war]] that ravaged Ethiopia from the 1970s to the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. On September 12, 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a military coup led by a Marxist faction in the armed forces, sparking a [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics | civil war]] as various movements emerged to oppose the new regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Key among these was the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which allied with other anti-government forces, including the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The war led to a famine that resulted in over 1.5 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. By May 1991, rebel forces led by the TPLF seized control of Addis Ababa, overthrowing the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Post-1991 Changes and Continued Conflicts

The overthrow of the regime in 1991 led to significant changes:
*   **[[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrean Independence]]**: Eritrea achieved independence from Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **[[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Federal Reorganization]]**: Ethiopia was reorganized along [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | federal lines]], officially becoming the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Its new constitution uniquely permitted secession for constituent parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **EPRDF Dominance**: The country became a one-party state under the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), an alliance including the TPLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Despite Tigrayans representing only six percent of the population, they held dominant roles in the federal government, including the prime ministership, held by Meles Zenawi from 1995 to 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Even after 1991, Ethiopia was not entirely at peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>:
*   **[[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | War with Eritrea]]**: Ethiopia fought a two-year war with [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] from 1998 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **[[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Somali Separatists]]**: For nearly 25 years, the country battled [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | ethnic Somali separatists]] of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) in the east, which ended with a peace agreement in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Oromia Conflict**: A half-century separatist conflict in Oromia province continued despite a supposed peace deal in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In early November (presumably 2020), the Oromo Liberation Army launched an attack in the eastern Galiso District, resulting in over 54 [[ethiopian_government_and_amhara_militia_conflict | ethnic Amhara]] deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Widespread Unrest**: Numerous other cases of unrest occurred across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Abiy Ahmed's Rise and Shifting Dynamics (2018 onwards)

In 2018, following major protests, Abiy Ahmed Ali, an [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | ethnic Oromo]], assumed leadership of the EPRDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to reach a border settlement with [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

However, his rise led to new tensions:
*   **Tigrayan Marginalization**: Tigrayans, who had long dominated the government and military, found themselves increasingly marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Concerns over [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | Federalism]]**: The new prime minister's calls for national unity raised concerns that he aimed to undermine the country's [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | federal structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Authoritarian Tendencies**: Despite being seen as a reformer, Abiy Ahmed began exhibiting authoritarian tendencies, including harsh measures on freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **EPRDF Dissolution**: In 2019, the EPRDF was dissolved and replaced by the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF crucially refused to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## The [[ethiopia_and_tigray_conflict_overview | Tigray Crisis]] (2020)

The immediate catalyst for the 2020 confrontation was a dispute over national and regional elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Elections scheduled for August 2020 were postponed due to the Covid pandemic, and the government extended the mandate of lawmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The TPLF-controlled government in Tigray rejected this, arguing it was evidence of increasing authoritarianism, and proceeded to hold regional elections in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Relations between the federal government and the Tigray regional administration, neither of which recognized the other as legitimate, rapidly deteriorated:
*   In early October, Tigray withdrew its representatives from federal government institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   The Ethiopian upper house of parliament voted to withhold budget subsidies to Tigray, leading to threats from Tigray to withhold tax receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   An attempt by the federal government to reshuffle military leadership in Tigray was blocked by the Tigray administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The most serious incident occurred in early November when a federal military barracks in Tigray was attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed accused the TPLF of orchestrating the attack to steal equipment, stating that "The last red line has been crossed with this morning's attacks and the federal government is therefore forced into military confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. On November 4, 2020, the Ethiopian government announced the start of a military offensive in Tigray and declared a six-month state of emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | Potential Consequences]]

The situation in Tigray is highly concerning to observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The government's shutdown of electricity, telephone, and internet connections into Tigray has prevented a clear picture from emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The fighting has the potential to lead to a full-scale [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | civil war]] that could tear the country apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

The seriousness of the situation is compounded by several factors:
*   **Military Strength**: Tigray is home to a large proportion of Ethiopia's troops and weaponry, and the TPLF maintains its own forces, making a direct confrontation between Ethiopia and Tigray distinct from other insurgencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Wider Regional Instability**: Any escalation could have dramatic effects in other parts of Ethiopia and potentially pull in neighboring states like [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Eritrea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Crisis**: Serious fighting could lead to significant refugee outflows and feed wider regional instability across the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The [[ethiopia_and_tigray_conflict_overview | Tigray Crisis]] represents a profoundly serious development for Ethiopia, with the potential to spiral out of control and become a full-scale [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | civil war]], posing a significant threat to peace and security in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

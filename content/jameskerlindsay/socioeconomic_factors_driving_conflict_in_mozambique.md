Mozambique is currently experiencing a serious [[Islamic insurgency in Mozambique | Islamic insurgency]] in its northern region, specifically in the Cabo Delgado province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While the conflict has links to Islamic State, its roots are deeply embedded in socioeconomic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Economic Landscape of Mozambique

Mozambique, located in southeast Africa, has a population of approximately 30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Historically, its economy has been predominantly agricultural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. However, the country also boasts significant natural resources, including large deposits of iron ore, gold, nickel, platinum, and bauxite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. More recently, substantial natural gas deposits were discovered off its northern coast, attracting major investments from international energy firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Despite steady economic growth over the past three decades, Mozambique remains one of the world's poorest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Underdevelopment and Resentment in Cabo Delgado

The insurgency is centered in Cabo Delgado, the northernmost of Mozambique's 11 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. With a population of around 2.3 million, many of the country's Muslims reside there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Crucially, Cabo Delgado is the poorest province in Mozambique, despite being the location of the natural gas discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

This combination of chronic underdevelopment and a pervasive resentment that the region's natural wealth is not benefiting the local population has created "fertile ground for recruitment" to the extremist cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The underlying themes of the conflict include:
*   Marginalisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   Poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   Disputes over resource revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>

While the population in Cabo Delgado is Muslim, providing a "ready outlet for their anger and frustration," the fundamental issues driving the problem are rooted in economic underdevelopment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## [[Economic and political consequences of conflict | Economic Consequences of the Insurgency]]

The ongoing insurgency directly threatens any [[Mozambiques economy and natural resources | economic gains]] from natural gas extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. A significant turning point occurred in March 2021, when militants launched a major assault on Palma, a port town central to natural gas production in the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The attack severely damaged the town and targeted a multi-billion dollar natural gas plant being constructed by the French energy company, Total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Shortly after, Total announced the suspension of its operations in Mozambique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

The conflict has had a devastating effect on efforts to develop the economy of one of the world's poorest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Humanitarian Impact

Beyond the economic toll, the insurgency has created a severe humanitarian crisis:
*   Over 2,500 people have been killed in more than 700 recorded attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Between half a million and 800,000 people (a quarter to a third of Cabo Delgado's population) have been displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   The UN estimates that 1.3 million people require humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## International Response and Long-Term Solutions

The growing insurgency has prompted [[International military involvement in Mozambique | international military involvement]]. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) authorized a military mission in June 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, and the European Union also authorized a military training mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Rwanda has also deployed 1,000 troops to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

While there is a growing military response, any long-term solution will need to address the underlying economic aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The exploitation of natural gas, which offered a significant hope for development, has ironically been curtailed by the insurgency itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This has locked Mozambique into a "vicious circle of underdevelopment begetting violence begetting underdevelopment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

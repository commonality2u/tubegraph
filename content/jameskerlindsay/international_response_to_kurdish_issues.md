The international community has historically grappled with the complex aspirations and challenges faced by the Kurds, particularly concerning their quest for a homeland and the responses of surrounding states.

## Historical Context and Post-World War I
Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, plans were drafted to divide the Anatolian Peninsula, which included the possibility of creating a Kurdish homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>. However, these plans were thwarted by Turkish nationalist forces under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, leading to the emergence of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, and the hopes for a Kurdish state died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The Kurds were subsequently divided among Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Turkish Opposition to Kurdish Statehood
Turkey has consistently viewed Kurdish efforts to establish a homeland, either within its borders or in neighboring countries, as a fundamental threat to its territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. For over four decades, the Turkish government has actively fought against Kurdish aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The establishment of the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)]] in northern Iraq in the early 1990s raised Turkish fears that it could become the basis for an eventual Kurdish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Western Support for Syrian Kurds Against ISIS
With the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Kurdish groups in northern Syria established self-rule, eventually declaring the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Despite Turkey's concerns about the Syrian Kurds' ties to the PKK, the rise of ISIS led key Western countries, including the United States, to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in combating the Islamic State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## Turkish Invasions and International Pressure
By 2019, with ISIS largely defeated, the Trump administration announced the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria following talks with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Seizing this opportunity, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring, an invasion aimed at establishing a "safe zone" and diminishing Kurdish control in northern and northeastern Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

This mission had wider ramifications, leading to a resurgence of ISIS as Kurdish forces were distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. As a result, and following significant [[international_response_to_azerbaijans_actions | international diplomatic pressure]] and even threats of sanctions, Turkey agreed to a ceasefire and withdrew its forces to a strip of Syrian territory along its border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Despite the ceasefire, Turkey has continued to signal the possibility of another full-scale invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. The recent fall of the Assad regime is seen by Ankara as a potential ideal moment to act against the Kurds, with reports indicating Turkey and its proxies are preparing a major assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## Prospects for International Assistance to Kurds

### United States and Western Countries
Attention for potential aid turns to Western countries, particularly the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. However, Washington faces a delicate balancing act: while it views the Kurds as valuable allies, Turkey is a NATO ally, and the US has historically avoided confrontations of this kind with Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. It is highly doubtful the US would help the Kurdish areas against a Turkish attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Instead, the US response would likely focus on de-escalation through diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and calls for restraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Few European countries would be willing or have the capacity to engage militarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### Israel
Israel has historically shown sympathy for the Kurds, viewing them as a counterbalance to shared adversaries like Iran, Syria, and Islamist groups, and has often voiced support for Kurdish aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. However, it is unlikely to offer direct military assistance if Turkey attacks, to avoid a direct military confrontation and straining relations with allies like the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. Any assistance would likely be focused, carefully calibrated, and might involve intelligence sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

### Iraqi Kurds
The [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | Iraqi Kurds]] share ethnic and cultural ties with Syrian Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. However, the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRG]] has been weakened and maintains a complex relationship with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Supporting Syrian Kurds, particularly the YPG (linked to the PKK), could jeopardize these ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Therefore, while humanitarian assistance is possible, significant military support from the [[kurdish_regional_government_challenges_in_iraq | KRG]] to Syria's Kurds is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

For these reasons, Turkey may calculate that now is the ideal moment to strike against the Kurds, with limited international military intervention expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

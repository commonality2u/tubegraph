Myanmar, also known by its original name Burma, has been subjected to military rule for much of its post-independence history, leading to an increasingly brutal conflict since February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While often perceived as a conflict between the military and pro-democracy forces, the situation is far more intricate, incorporating an 80-year insurgency between the state and various ethnic militias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This complex and protracted conflict has made the [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | Burmese Civil War]] arguably the most complicated in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Post-Independence Instability and Military Intervention

Myanmar gained independence from Britain on 4 January 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Prior to independence, the country faced severe instability, including the assassination of Prime Minister Aung San, who was considered the father of the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The first major [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic insurgency]] broke out with the Karen rebellion, which continued after independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Despite the constitution accepting a right of secession after 10 years, ethnic tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Faced with these challenges, the Armed Forces, which originated from the wartime Burma Independence Army (BIA), began to view themselves as the protectors of the new state's unity and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The military's first direct foray into politics occurred in October 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Following a split in the ruling Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) and a subsequent political crisis, the military established a caretaker government under its Chief of Staff, General Ne Win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Although democratic elections were held a year later, Ne Win seized power again in March 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Ne Win's Repressive Military State (1962-1988)

Upon seizing power, Ne Win transformed Burma into a highly repressive one-party military state, embracing a Marxist ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This regime, in turn, fueled various [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic insurgencies]] across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. By the 1970s, numerous ethnic opposition groups had emerged, many with insurgent military wings, including the Kachin Independence Army, the Karen National Liberation Army, the Karenni Liberation Army, the Mon National Defence Organisation, the Shan State Army, and the Wa National Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

By the mid-1980s, two decades of repression, conflict, and poor economic management had rendered Burma one of the poorest countries globally, intensifying calls for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This culminated in widespread protests in 1988, forcing Ne Win to step down after 26 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## SLORC and SPDC Eras (1988-2011)

Instead of a return to democracy, a new military body, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), assumed control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Although the SLORC brutally suppressed opposition, it allowed elections in May 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, it refused to accept the overwhelming victory of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), co-founded by Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of General Aung San <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The SLORC stated its intention to remain in power to preserve the country's unity, solidarity, and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Despite international condemnation and Aung San Suu Kyi being awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize while under house arrest, the SLORC intensified its repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The regime, which renamed Burma to Myanmar, also launched fresh campaigns against [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic insurgencies]] that had proliferated into new splinter groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Over the subsequent years, the military steadily reasserted control through force or ceasefires, while some areas like Shan descended into criminality, funding activities through drug production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Transition to "Disciplined Democracy" (2008-2021)

In response to persistent domestic and international calls for change, the military unveiled a new, purportedly democratic constitution in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This constitution was designed to ensure the military's continued political centrality by reserving a quarter of parliamentary seats and key ministries for military appointees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

On 7 November 2010, Burmese voters participated in elections for the first time in three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The NLD boycotted due to Aung San Suu Kyi's disqualification, leading to a victory for the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), a military front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Despite the NLD and insurgent groups rejecting the results, these elections were seen as a crucial first step toward democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Optimism grew when the NLD won overwhelmingly in the 2015 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Although Aung San Suu Kyi was prevented from becoming president due to her foreign marriage, she became State Counsellor, effectively Myanmar's prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. However, hopes for a new approach to [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic insurgencies]] were premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The NLD showed little interest in creating a federal system, a key demand of many ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Furthermore, the government, including Aung San Suu Kyi, faced widespread international condemnation for defending the military's brutal treatment of ethnic minorities, such as the Rohingya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Many observers saw this as pro-democracy sentiment not extending to national minorities, instead aligning with majoritarian ethnic Burmese nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## The 2021 Military Coup and Renewed Conflict

Despite the apparent alignment between the military and the NLD, hopes for firm democratic restoration proved premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. In November 2020, the NLD secured another resounding victory in national elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. However, the USDP complained of widespread fraud, and despite observer reports deeming the vote essentially free and fair, the military intervened again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

On 1 February 2021, the military announced a one-year state of emergency, transferring power to the Armed Forces Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders were placed under house arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This new military takeover immediately triggered widespread popular protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. As months passed, opposition to the regime became more organized, leading to the formation of the National Unity Government (NUG) and its military wing, the People's Defense Force (PDF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

The military regime brutally cracked down on dissent, arresting and torturing thousands of pro-democracy protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. In response, many [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic rebel groups]] intensified their attacks, with some aligning with the NUG, which proclaimed its intention to restructure Myanmar as a federation after overthrowing the junta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Operation 1027 and the Military's Current Challenge

Crucially, several key rebel groups, including the Three Brotherhood Alliance (composed of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, and the Arakan Army), initially remained detached from the resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This changed on 27 October 2023, when they launched a major coordinated offensive called Operation 1027 against the regime's forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Since then, the Alliance has made significant headway, capturing large swathes of territory, with reports of mass surrenders and defections from regime forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Their success has reinvigorated other [[ethnic_insurgencies_in_myanmar | ethnic rebel groups]], leading to a growing number of attacks across the country since Operation 1027 began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Neighboring China has also seemingly thrown its support behind the Alliance, which is combating organized crime gangs along the Chinese border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Beijing has grown increasingly concerned about a burgeoning internet scam industry that has trafficked over 100,000 Chinese nationals into Myanmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

These developments have led many observers to believe that the military regime may finally be facing defeat, marking the most severe threat to the armed forces in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. However, caution remains, as the military is reportedly adjusting its tactics and may implement a mass mobilization if insurgent forces approach the capital or major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

Even if the resistance prevails and democracy is restored, the conflict is unlikely to fully end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | civil war]] is rooted in a more profound and longer-running conflict, with ethnic groups fighting for autonomy and independence for almost 80 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Thus, defeating the military would only resolve one aspect of Myanmar's problems, leaving the enormous task of ending what is effectively the world's longest-running [[myanmar_civil_war_and_recent_developments | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

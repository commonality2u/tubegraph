For many years, [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] has been considered a pariah state, largely shunned by the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This status stems from its history as a repressive dictatorship and a destabilizing actor in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The last decade, in particular, has seen [[syrias_history_and_political_development | Syria]] locked in a brutal civil war, resulting in hundreds of thousands dead, millions displaced, and the government committing significant human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Historical Context of Repression

[[syrias_history_and_political_development | Syria]] has faced massive internal tensions across its diverse society since its early statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The country experienced frequent [[syrias_political_instability_and_coups | political instability and coups]] after its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

A significant shift occurred in November 1970 when Hafez al-Assad launched a coup, becoming president the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He instituted a harsh and repressive regime internally, eliminating all opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Assad concentrated political power and state security in the hands of the Alawite minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Externally, he sought to make [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] a leading actor in the Arab world, aligning with the Soviet Union, taking an anti-American stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, and adopting an uncompromisingly hardline position on Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This led to Damascus supporting militant Palestinian groups, resulting in [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] being designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department, a status it still holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] also sent troops into [[impact_of_syrian_refugees_on_lebanon | Lebanon]] during its Civil War, eventually becoming an occupying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, and built close ties with revolutionary Iran, facilitating efforts to undermine Israel and assist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Consequently, under Hafez al-Assad, [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] was regarded as one of the most repressive, dangerous, and destabilizing states in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

When Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, hopes for reform quickly vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He maintained strict control over domestic politics and continued the country's hardline foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Escalation to Civil War

Everything changed with the emergence of the Arab Spring in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Protests erupted in [[syrias_history_and_political_development | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, and in response, the Assad regime launched a brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This led to widespread international condemnation from countries like the United States and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, and calls for restraint from [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]]'s Arab neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. In November 2011, the Arab League suspended [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] and imposed economic and political sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Despite international peace efforts, violence escalated, and by 2012, the uprising became a full-scale [[impact_of_syrias_civil_war_on_international_relations | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## The Syrian Civil War

### Key Actors and Shifting Dynamics
Initially, opposition forces seemed to gain the upper hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. While Iran supported Damascus, a growing international coalition, including [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]], Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Western states like the United States, supported the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

By 2015, the dynamic changed as various Islamist groups, including Al-Qaeda and Islamic State, became significant actors in the [[impact_of_syrias_civil_war_on_international_relations | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. International attention shifted to containing this new threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Concurrently, Russia intervened to support Assad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This fundamentally transformed the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

While opposition forces, including the Kurds, secured the country's northeast, the Syrian Army began retaking the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. By 2020, Islamic State was largely defeated, [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] had invaded to limit Kurdish power in the north, and Syrian government forces controlled two-thirds of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Allegations of Human Rights Abuses
During the [[impact_of_syrias_civil_war_on_international_relations | civil war]], the Syrian government committed human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In 2013, there were allegations that Damascus had used chemical weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### Current Situation and Aftermath
Although skirmishes continue, an effective stalemate now exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The war is effectively over, or is at best a frozen conflict, with Assad remaining in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The conflict has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced, mainly to neighboring states like [[turkey_and_syria_kurdistan_conflict | Turkey]] and [[impact_of_syrian_refugees_on_lebanon | Lebanon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## International Response and Challenges to Rehabilitation

Despite signs of changing relations, such as moves to lift [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]]'s suspension from the Arab League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, significant opposition to [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]]'s rehabilitation persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Qatar, for example, insists that [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] cannot be accepted back until a final political settlement to the conflict is reached, the displaced are dealt with, and repression ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The United States and the European Union remain vehemently opposed to the Assad regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The EU maintains that no normalisation of relations can occur until a political solution to the conflict is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Those in favor of engagement acknowledge that while they may have preferred the end of the Assad regime, it remains in power and appears secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. They argue that engagement is necessary to address critical issues, including the question of refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Concerns about Iran's influence in the region, strengthened through its support for [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]], and the proliferation of amphetamines from [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] are also factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

Despite efforts to reopen dialogue, such as Saudi Arabia's calls for [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]]'s readmission to the Arab League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, it seems highly unlikely that [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]] will be widely accepted on the world stage again anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The opposing voices regarding the lifting of [[syrias_international_relations_and_rehabilitation_efforts | Syria]]'s suspension by the Arab League currently have the upper hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, moves to open the door to readmission into the community of Arab states signal a significant moment for this long-standing pariah state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Addressing the ongoing human rights issues and finding a lasting political solution remain key [[future_challenges_for_syria_postassad | future challenges for Syria post-Assad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

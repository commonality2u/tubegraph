In late 2023, Slovak voters elected a new government [00:00:03]. This government is led by a former long-standing prime minister, Robert Fico, who is widely regarded as pro-Russian [00:00:08]. Since his election, the country has pushed back against helping neighboring Ukraine in its war against Moscow [00:00:13]. This shift raises questions about whether Slovakia is undermining Western solidarity [00:00:00] and if it remains one of NATO's weak links [00:00:30].

## Western Unity and Divergences

The war in Ukraine has significantly reinvigorated Western unity [00:00:44]. This conflict has fostered a new sense of purpose among NATO and European Union countries, especially after previous deep splits and speculation about Washington shifting focus away from Europe [00:00:54]. In response to the war, these countries have imposed unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia, provided extensive military aid to Ukraine, reaffirmed their commitment to collective defense, and welcomed new members into NATO [000:01:05]. They have also opened EU accession talks with several Central and Eastern European states [00:01:18].

Despite this cohesion, several countries have not fully joined the united economic, political, diplomatic, and military front against Russia [00:01:24]. Turkey, a NATO member, has maintained close ties to Moscow and refused to implement EU and US sanctions [00:01:36]. Hungary, an EU and NATO member, has also consistently tried to thwart its partners' efforts to take a tough stance on Moscow [00:01:45]. [[hungarys_political_direction_under_viktor_orban | Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban]] has openly admitted his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin [00:01:51]. More recently, Slovakia has emerged as another source of concern [00:02:00].

## A Brief History of Slovakia

Slovakia is a landlocked state in Central Europe, covering approximately 49,000 square kilometers [00:02:07]. It borders Hungary to its south, Austria and the Czech Republic to its west, Poland to its north, and shares a 100-kilometer border with Ukraine to its east [00:02:18]. Its population is around 5.4 million, with ethnic Slovaks comprising about 80% [00:02:28].

Slovakia's origins trace back to the fifth and sixth centuries when Slavic tribes settled in Central Europe, eventually forming the Great Moravian Empire [00:02:39]. After the empire's collapse in the early 10th century, the area became part of the Kingdom of Hungary, later the Austro-Hungarian Empire [00:02:51]. This lasted until 1918, when Austria-Hungary collapsed at the end of the First World War [00:03:03]. The northern Slavic population, the Czechs and Slovaks, then established an independent state: Czechoslovakia [00:03:08].

Czechoslovakia became the most economically prosperous and democratic state in Eastern Europe [00:03:16]. However, internal tensions emerged, with Slovakia being the less populous and developed "junior partner" compared to the Czech parts [00:03:21]. In March 1939, Czechoslovakia collapsed after Hitler's annexation of its western part [00:03:32]. Slovakia also broke away, becoming an ultra-nationalist Nazi puppet state under Jozef Tiso during the Second World War [00:03:38].

Czechoslovakia was reestablished after the war but fell under communist control, becoming part of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War [00:03:51]. This period ended in 1989 with a peaceful revolution that overthrew communist rule [00:04:06]. Although reconstituted as a democratic federation, pressure for greater Slovak autonomy grew [00:04:12]. In 1992, Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to dissolve the country in the "Velvet Divorce" [00:04:20]. On January 1, 1993, they emerged as separate independent states [00:04:26].

## Post-Independence Political Trajectory

After independence, the Czech Republic and Slovakia maintained close and friendly relations [00:04:34]. However, Slovakia took a different political and economic path [00:04:41]. While the Czechs pursued NATO and EU membership, Slovakia's European integration suffered under the nationalist, authoritarian rule of its independence leader, Vladimir Mečiar [00:04:46]. Concerns about corruption, press freedom, and judicial independence made Slovakia appear the most problematic of the former Soviet satellite states [00:04:58].

This changed in 1998 when a new centre-right government, led by Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda, took office [00:05:10]. Committed to European integration, Slovakia quickly caught up, joining NATO in 2004 and then the European Union alongside nine other countries, including the Czech Republic [00:05:17].

## Robert Fico's First Tenure and Policy Shifts

Although Slovakia was seen as a dynamic new EU member, the centre-right administration was voted out in 2006 [00:05:32]. It was replaced by a populist left-wing nationalist government led by Robert Fico [00:05:37]. Fico and his Smer-SD party focused on social welfare and public spending, following the previous government's economic liberalization reforms [00:05:48].

Changes also occurred in foreign policy [00:06:02]. A significant departure point was Kosovo: Slovakia, along with Greece, Cyprus, Spain, and Romania, refused to recognize its 2008 Declaration of Independence, contrary to most EU and NATO partners [00:06:05]. Tensions also arose during the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe [00:06:20]. Slovakia joined Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic (the Visegrád Four) in rejecting calls to take in refugees, angering many Western European states [00:06:26].

The biggest test came with Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014 [00:06:40]. Having had past disagreements with Ukraine over Russian energy supplies, Fico initially opposed EU sanctions on Moscow, arguing that Europe should maintain economic links [00:06:46]. He also stressed that Slovakia would be severely affected by limits on Russian energy supplies [00:06:59]. Despite these concerns, Slovakia eventually aligned its policies with the EU and NATO, condemning Russia's actions and endorsing Ukraine's territorial integrity [00:07:08]. The Slovak government introduced sanctions on Moscow, began reducing dependence on Russian energy, and even helped Ukraine when Russia tried to limit gas supplies [00:07:20].

By this point, having been in power for most of the decade, Fico appeared to dominate Slovak politics [00:07:34]. However, amid accusations of authoritarianism and rampant state corruption, his tenure ended in 2018 [00:07:41]. He was forced to resign after a journalist investigating links between politicians and organized crime was brutally murdered alongside his girlfriend, sparking widespread public anger [00:07:46]. He was replaced by a political ally [00:08:00].

## A Brief Period of Western Alignment

After Fico's resignation, Slovakia seemed to move in a new direction [00:08:04]. A young, modernizing president was elected in 2019 [00:08:08], and a new right-wing coalition government came to power the following year, vowing to fight corruption and implement reforms [00:08:14].

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and unlike the previous Fico administration, the government aligned itself with its EU and NATO partners [00:08:19]. It condemned the Russian attack, imposed sanctions on Moscow, took in over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and provided Ukraine with weapons, including fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile systems [00:08:31].

## Fico's Return and Divergent Policies

While Slovakia appeared fully aligned with its Western partners, the mood within the country was changing [00:08:45]. Growing disillusionment with the government, perceived as failing its promises, combined with increasing public skepticism about the war in Ukraine [00:08:52]. Polling indicated that less than half the population supported sanctions against Moscow or economic and military aid to Ukraine, in a country where a large majority still saw Russia as a brotherly nation [00:09:02]. These concerns were highlighted in June 2023 when the president, citing death threats, announced she would not seek a second term [00:09:15].

The most significant concern emerged as the country prepared for a general election in September 2023 [00:09:26]. Five years after his ousting, Robert Fico sought to return as prime minister [00:09:33]. Capitalizing on popular sentiment, he adopted an overtly pro-Russian position [00:09:39]. He challenged Slovakia's Western partners, arguing that sanctions were harming the Slovak economy and promising to oppose any further economic measures against Moscow [00:09:44]. He also pledged to stop any further armed supplies to Ukraine, insisting Slovakia would not send "another bullet" [00:09:54].

Despite polling predictions of a loss, Fico scored a major victory, taking around a quarter of the vote and returning to power at the head of a new coalition government [00:10:03]. Once in office, hopes that his tough language was mere campaign rhetoric quickly vanished [00:10:16]. Within weeks, the new government announced the end of all military aid to Ukraine [00:10:22].

Fico continued to court controversy [00:10:27]. In early 2024, he called Ukraine corrupt and under US domination, suggesting it would have to accept territorial loss as the price of peace [00:10:32]. He also reiterated his long-standing opposition to Ukrainian NATO membership, arguing it was the basis for a third world war [00:10:40]. There was also considerable anger when the Slovak foreign minister met his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, at a diplomatic forum in Turkey [00:10:49]. Additionally, Fico has been building ties with [[hungarys_political_direction_under_viktor_orban | Hungary's Viktor Orban]] [00:10:57].

## Mixed Messages and Underlying Motives

Despite these actions, Fico has been careful not to sever relations with Ukraine entirely [00:11:04]. In January 2024, he assured his Ukrainian counterpart that Slovakia would support Ukraine's EU accession and not block a large EU aid package [00:11:11]. This was followed by another meeting in April, where he announced that Slovakia would increase business ties with Ukraine, strengthen transport links, and provide a corridor for Ukrainian agricultural goods [00:11:22].

Likewise, while Fico cut state military aid to Ukraine as promised, he clarified that he would not object to private support [00:11:35]. This led to an "extraordinary development" [00:11:44]: thousands of Slovaks, objecting to the government's position, joined a crowdfunding campaign to support a Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine [00:11:47].

The reasons behind this mixed messaging are unclear, with several theories suggested [00:11:57]. Some believe it may reflect close trading links between Ukraine and Slovakia [00:12:03]. Others suggest Fico may be observing the direction of the Ukraine war [00:12:08]. Alternatively, even if he instinctively supports Russia, Fico may know that Slovakia cannot or should not break ties with its EU and NATO partners in the same way [[hungarys_political_direction_under_viktor_orban | Hungary's Viktor Orban]] has [00:12:13]. Some have even suggested that Fico may not be as pro-Russian as he appears [00:12:27].

Regardless of Fico's true position, his words and actions have created uncertainty about Slovakia's aims and objectives [00:12:32]. This has undermined broader US and EU trust in Slovakia's reliability as an ally [00:12:41]. At the same time, it has created the impression that Slovakia is another "weak link" in the broader Western front against Russia [00:12:48].

In recent years, there has been growing concern about [[hungarys_political_direction_under_viktor_orban | Hungary's political direction]] under its leader, Viktor Orbán <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His actions, including attacking democratic freedoms at home and undermining Western solidarity over Ukraine, have led many to believe he is actively serving Russia's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Hungary's Integration into Western Organizations

The modern world order is built on multilateralism, with a massive growth in international organizations since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While most have clear joining rules, few define ways to expel a member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Organizations like NATO and the European Union expect members to adhere to shared values, specifically a fundamental respect for the principles of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. [[Comparative analysis of Hungary and other EU and NATO member states | Hungary]] has emerged as a significant challenge for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, being increasingly at odds with its Western partners over a range of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Geographic and Historical Context
[[Hungary]] is a landlocked country in Central Europe, bordered by seven nations: Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. With a population of around 9.8 million, it is primarily ethnic Hungarian with minority communities including Roma, Germans, Romanians, and Slovaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Linguistically, Hungarian is unusual, belonging to a separate family from surrounding Indo-European languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

After centuries under Habsburg rule as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, [[Hungary]] became an independent state after World War I under the Treaty of Trianon, which stripped it of almost two-thirds of its traditional territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This remains a source of bitterness for many Hungarians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Following World War II, [[Hungary]] fell under Soviet influence, becoming part of the Warsaw Pact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. A popular uprising against Soviet control in 1956 was brutally suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, [[Hungary]] peacefully transitioned to democracy as the Cold War ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Post-Cold War Western Orientation
In the years following the Cold War, [[Hungary]] quickly oriented itself towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>:
*   **1994**: Applied for EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **March 1999**: Joined NATO, becoming one of the first former Warsaw Pact members to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **May 2004**: Joined the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Initially, [[Hungary]] was seen as a success story of EU and NATO enlargement, having managed its transition to democracy well and attracting significant international investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. It even joined the Schengen Area in December 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Despite some economic difficulties, including a €20 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the country was considered a good member of the "Western club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Shift Under Viktor Orbán and its Impact on the EU

Things began to change with the May 2010 national elections, when the centre-right Fidesz party won a landslide victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Viktor Orbán, who had previously served as prime minister (1998-2002) and was seen as an internationalist liberal, returned to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Eroding Democratic Norms
Within months, Orbán introduced measures to restrict press freedoms, which were later watered down after EU pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. He further stirred anger by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. As he consolidated power, problems grew:
*   **Media and Civil Liberties**: Further restrictions on media freedoms and a clampdown on civil liberties and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **"Illiberal Democracy"**: By 2014, Orbán openly declared his vision for [[Hungary]] as an "illiberal democracy" based on a "different, special, national approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Nationalism and Xenophobia**: His overt nationalism and xenophobia caused wider problems, including antagonizing neighbors by reaching out to Hungarian communities abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. He became overtly anti-immigrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, undermining EU solidarity during the 2015 Refugee Crisis by refusing to resettle asylum seekers, calling them "potential terrorists" and "intruders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### EU's Response and Hungary's Resilience
Despite mounting criticisms, Orbán seemed untroubled, reveling in his notoriety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This was largely due to the EU's persistent failure to tackle his behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. [[Hungary]] became skilled at "playing the bloc's politics," backing down on controversial measures just enough and when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Orbán also enjoyed high-level protection from the centre-right European People's Party in the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Even after the European Parliament voted to start infringement proceedings against [[Hungary]] in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, Orbán knew he was safe. Any serious action, including the suspension of membership rights (the "nuclear option"), would require the support of all other member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This was guaranteed not to happen as Poland had also taken a deeply illiberal turn and served as [[Hungary]]'s closest ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

The situation continued to deteriorate. In 2019, Freedom House downgraded [[Hungary]]'s democratic standards to "partly free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, the only EU member given this rating. It noted that Orbán was using his parliamentary strength to control the opposition, media, religious groups, academia, NGOs, courts, asylum seekers, and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Many observers noted that [[Hungary]] had essentially become a corrupt one-party state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, with fears that Orbán and [[Hungary]] were becoming a role model for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## [[Hungarys relations with Russia and Ukraine | Impact on Western Solidarity over Ukraine]]

While the domestic situation was a growing concern, the war in Ukraine brought [[Hungary]] to wider international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Initial Fears**: There were fears [[Hungary]] would block Western action against Moscow due to Orbán's close relationship with Putin and strained relations between Budapest and Kyiv over the Hungarian minority in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Surprising Support**: Initially, Orbán surprised observers by opposing the invasion and supporting EU sanctions against Moscow, though [[Hungary]] did hamper NATO efforts to supply military aid to Ukraine by using its airspace to Ukrainian aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Shift in Stance**: This skepticism was confirmed when Fidesz won another landslide victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. After being congratulated by Putin and reappointing pro-Russian figures, Orbán quickly changed his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. [[Hungary]] became increasingly obstructive, trying to limit the scale of sanctions on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> and refusing to back EU proposals to reduce Russian gas consumption, eventually forcing an exemption for [[Hungary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **NATO Obstruction**: Alongside Turkey, [[Hungary]] has also not yet ratified Sweden and Finland's membership of NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Continued Controversial Rhetoric**: Orbán continues to voice openly nationalist and racist views, such as his July 2022 comment that Hungarians didn't want to become a "mixed race," which was widely condemned internationally and even led to a resignation from his advisory team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Hungary as "Moscow's Trojan Horse"

Many believe Orbán is acting on Russia's behalf, suggesting [[Hungary]] is Moscow's "Trojan Horse" within the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. While this fits a pattern of Russian interference, caution is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Orbán's position may also be shaped by self-centered factors, including:
*   A genuine commitment to authoritarian national populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Admiration for the Russian leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   A desire to antagonize Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   A way to divert national attention from wholesale corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   Prioritizing [[Hungary]]'s economic interests over solidarity with EU and NATO partners or Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## [[EU and NATOs response to Hungarys policies | Future of Hungary's EU Membership]]

The tide may finally be turning against Orbán <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. In February 2022, the European Court of Justice ruled that EU money can be withheld from members that do not abide by the body's fundamental values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. As a result, in September, the European Commission announced plans to withhold 7.5 billion euros of funding over persistent public procurement corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

While Budapest has agreed to measures to fix the problem, many remain skeptical, believing Orbán will merely comply temporarily before reverting to his old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. They argue that he remains deeply intolerant, authoritarian, and xenophobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Calls for Tougher Action
For these reasons, many want far tougher steps, with calls for [[Hungary]] to be expelled from NATO and the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, this is unlikely to happen as there is currently no mechanism for a country to be expelled from either body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Despite Orbán's misdeeds, there is a deep reluctance to pursue such a radical and unprecedented step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Nonetheless, not taking decisive action carries significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Regardless of direct influence from Moscow, [[Hungary]]'s position on democratic standards, civil liberties, human rights, and engagement with Russia fundamentally clashes with the values of almost all its EU and NATO partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. By not acting, both organizations not only undermine their own values but also risk encouraging other members to follow [[Hungary]]'s path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The West must seriously consider how to address its "Hungary problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

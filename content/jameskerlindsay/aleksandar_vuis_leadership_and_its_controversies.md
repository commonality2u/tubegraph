Since 2017, [[Aleksandar Vučićs leadership and international relations | Aleksandar Vučić]] has been the President of Serbia, consolidating power and significantly influencing the country's political landscape over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. His leadership has transformed Serbia, though opinions are divided on whether this has been for the better or worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Rise to Power

[[Aleksandar Vučićs leadership and international relations | Aleksandar Vučić]] emerged as a new political leader following a period of disillusionment with the Democratic Party and fatigue with the extremism of nationalist parties in Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

*   **Early Career & Rebranding** He served as Slobodan Milošević’s Minister for Information, building a reputation as a staunch nationalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, he later rebranded himself as a pro-European reformer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Founding the Serbian Progressive Party** In early 2008, Vučić broke away from the Radical Party and co-founded the Serbian Progressive Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Ascension to Prime Minister** His political career rapidly advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. He served as Deputy Prime Minister in a coalition government from 2012 to 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The Progressives won an overwhelming victory in the 2014 general election, making Vučić Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. They secured another significant win in early elections held two years later in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Presidency** The real turning point came in 2017 when Vučić was elected president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Although the Serbian political system is similar to the French model (president oversees foreign policy, prime minister runs domestic policy), Vučić became the undisputed power in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He secured a second five-year presidential term in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Supporters' View

Supporters of Vučić's administration highlight several positive developments under his leadership:

*   **Economic Growth** The economy has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Projects** Major infrastructure projects, including roads and railways, have been implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Foreign Investment** Steps have been taken to increase foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Popularity** Beyond urban centers, many ordinary Serbs believe he has overseen economic growth and enjoy his leadership style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Controversies and Opponents' View

Opponents of Vučić's leadership insist he has overseen a steady rolling back of democratic freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Their criticisms include:

*   **Suppression of Freedoms** Accusations of suppressing the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Electoral Manipulation** Allegations of manipulating elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Power Consolidation** Use of state resources and political patronage to bolster his power base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Corruption** Oversight of widespread rampant corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Environmental Damage** His quest for foreign investment is argued to have caused significant environmental damage to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Examples include a major waterfront development in Belgrade and the impact of proposed lithium mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **International Complicity** Opposition parties argue that international partners, including the European Union and the United States, have been complicit by supporting the administration and prioritizing stability over democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Current Unrest and Future Prospects

The latest wave of protests, sparked by a tragic incident at Novi Sad railway station in November 2024, reflects deep-rooted mismanagement at the heart of the government, according to critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Students, later joined by other societal groups, began demanding justice, greater transparency, and more government spending on infrastructure and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

While the president remains defiant, asserting that the protests are foreign-instigated attempts to undermine Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, the administration is clearly concerned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević in January 2025 highlights this concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

The protests, currently growing in momentum, are seen as a "battle of wills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Despite the lack of a coherent and credible opposition, past experience in Serbia has shown that popular protest can force leaders from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. If demonstrations continue to grow or if serious violence erupts, the pressure on [[Aleksandar Vučićs leadership and international relations | Vučić]] could become overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. However, Vučić has prior experience in tackling widespread protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, leading many to believe his position is secure for the time being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

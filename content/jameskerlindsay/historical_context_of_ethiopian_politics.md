Ethiopia, once known as Abyssinia, stands out in Africa for never having formally fallen under European colonial rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:29">[02:53:29]</a>. In 1945, it became one of only four African founding members of the United Nations, alongside Egypt, Liberia, and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>.

## Post-Colonial Era and Eritrean Independence Struggle
The modern historical context of [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopian politics]] begins in the 1960s when northern Ethiopia descended into conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:29">[03:08:29]</a>. This was primarily due to Eritrea, which the UN had granted to Ethiopia in 1952, initiating a war for its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:39">[03:15:39]</a>.

Following the overthrow of [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie]] by a Marxist military coup in 1974, the main Eritrean militia, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), allied with other ethno-national rebel groups to combat the Soviet-supported regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:59">[03:21:59]</a>. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was the most significant among these rebel groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:19">[03:39:19]</a>.

In May 1991, as the Cold War ended, these allied forces captured the [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopian]] capital, Addis Ababa, and overthrew the military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:19">[03:45:19]</a>. This led to Eritrea's independence and the reorganization of the rest of Ethiopia into a democratic federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:19">[03:55:19]</a>.

## Tigrayan Dominance and Post-1991 Tensions
Despite its multi-ethnic character, [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopia]] soon became dominated by the Tigrayans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:49">[04:04:49]</a>. Internally, it functioned as a one-party state under the TPLF-dominated [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:19">[04:11:19]</a>.

A significant falling out between the TPLF and its former ally, the EPLF, over the border in Tigray, escalated into a bitter two-year war between [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Ethiopia and Eritrea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:19">[04:20:19]</a>. This conflict, which occurred between 1998 and 2000, is estimated to have caused up to 300,000 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:19">[04:32:19]</a>.

## Shift in Power and Abiy Ahmed's Reforms (2018 onwards)
Everything changed in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:19">[04:36:19]</a>. Following major protests, [[current_political_situation_involving_ethiopian_prime_minister_abiy_ahmed | Abiy Ahmed Ali]], an ethnic Oromo, became the leader of the EPRDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:19">[04:40:19]</a>. Almost immediately, he began dismantling Tigrayan power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:19">[04:47:19]</a>.

In 2019, Abiy Ahmed dissolved the EPRDF and formed the ethnically unified Prosperity Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:19">[04:51:19]</a>. However, the TPLF refused to join, accusing the Prime Minister of increasing authoritarianism and attempting to centralize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:19">[04:57:19]</a>.

Tensions further escalated between [[current_political_situation_involving_ethiopian_prime_minister_abiy_ahmed | Abiy Ahmed]] and Tigray when the Prime Minister signed a landmark border agreement with neighboring Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:19">[05:05:19]</a>, an agreement for which he received the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:19">[05:14:19]</a>. This agreement had a significant [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_ethiopia_eritrea_dynamics | impact on Ethiopia-Eritrea relations]].

## Escalation to Conflict (2020)
The final countdown to war began in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:19">[05:20:19]</a>. Due to the spread of Covid-19, Ethiopia's electoral commission postponed general elections planned for August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:19">[05:25:19]</a>. The TPLF, however, refused to accept this decision, viewing it as a power grab, and proceeded to hold its own vote in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:19">[05:33:19]</a>.

By October 2020, Ethiopia was in a political crisis, with the federal and Tigrayan governments no longer recognizing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:19">[05:44:19]</a>. Tigray withdrew from national institutions and refused the appointment of a new commander for the Ethiopian National Defense Forces in the region, leading the federal government to cut funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:19">[05:52:19]</a>. The ultimate trigger for war was an attack on a federal military barracks in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:19">[06:03:19]</a>.

On November 4, 2020, [[current_political_situation_involving_ethiopian_prime_minister_abiy_ahmed | Abiy Ahmed]] addressed the nation, accusing the TPLF of raiding the barracks to steal weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:19">[06:09:19]</a>. He announced a six-month state of emergency and ordered the national army to reassert control over Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:19">[06:18:19]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Conflict Concerns**
> While Ethiopia was familiar with insurgencies, the situation with Tigray was considered far more serious due to the TPLF's significant weapons, manpower, and highly capable military commanders, many of whom had held high positions in the National Defense Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:19">[06:31:19]</a>.

Abiy Ahmed initially sought a military victory, rejecting mediation offers from senior African figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:19">[06:53:19]</a>. Federal forces quickly seized Mekele, the Tigrayan capital, and installed a new administration within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:19">[07:08:19]</a>. However, the TPLF regrouped in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:19">[07:20:19]</a>. Reports emerged of atrocities across Tigray, with credible allegations that Abiy Ahmed had enlisted Eritrea's support to defeat the TPLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:19">[07:27:19]</a>. Additionally, the neighboring [[historical_role_of_amhara_in_ethiopian_statehood | federal state of Amhara]], with its long-standing boundary dispute with Tigray, joined the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:19">[07:43:19]</a>.

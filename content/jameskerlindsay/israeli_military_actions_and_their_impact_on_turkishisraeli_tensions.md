Once close [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | allies]], [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | tensions]] between [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]] and [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] have steadily risen over the past two decades, now appearing close to a boiling point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Against a backdrop of growing [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | tensions]] in [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]], there is a real threat of [[potential_conflict_and_escalation_between_turkey_and_israel | confrontation]] between Israeli and Turkish forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## A Collapsing Alliance

The [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | relationship]] between [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] and [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]] is considered one of the most interesting examples of a powerful partnership breaking down into strategic opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite being close strategic partners with strong defense and intelligence cooperation at one time, the two countries now seem to be on the brink of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Key Israeli Military Actions and Their Impact

Several key Israeli military actions have significantly impacted and deteriorated the [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | relations]] between [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]] and [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]].

### The Gaza Flotilla Incident (2010)

A critical moment in the deterioration of [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | relations]] occurred in May 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **The Incident**: A convoy of Turkish ships attempted to deliver aid supplies to Gaza, which was under Israeli blockade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While in international waters, the lead vessel was raided by Israeli commandos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: This raid resulted in nine deaths and over 30 injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Turkish Reaction**: [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]], furious about the incident, withdrew its ambassador to [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]], leaving the once-solid [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | relationship]] in tatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Turkish President Erdoğan became an increasingly vocal critic of [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Attempted Reconciliation**: In March 2013, an Israeli apology led to an agreement to restore [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | diplomatic relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Three years later, the Israeli government agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the families of those killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. However, this progress was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Gaza Fighting (2018)

In May 2018, [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | relations]] again nosedived after heavy fighting in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Retaliation to [[Hamas attack on Israel and its consequences | Hamas Attack]] (2023)

The most recent deterioration was spurred by [[Hamas attack on Israel and its consequences | Hamas's surprise attack on Israel]] on October 7, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Israeli Military Campaign**: As [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] retaliated with a full-scale military campaign in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Turkish Reaction**: Erdoğan became increasingly outspoken about the Israeli offensive, openly accusing Israeli leaders of committing war crimes and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This led to [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]] severing [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | diplomatic ties]] with [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] in November 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Airstrikes in [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]] (2024)

A critical development occurred just weeks after the Gaza events, with the overthrow of the Assad regime in [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]] by the Islamist HTS militia and its Turkish-backed [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | allies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This led to [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]] emerging as a key international actor in the country, maintaining a military presence in northern [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Ankara]] views the de facto autonomous [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syrian]] [[turkeys_military_operations_against_kurds | Kurdish]] region as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

*   **Israeli Military Action**: On April 2, [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] carried out airstrikes against several [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syrian]] military installations, including two air bases reportedly considered by [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Ankara]] as potential bases for its forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] viewed [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]]'s expanding role in [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]] as a substantial security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Israeli Justification**: [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]] was explicit that the attacks were directed at [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Turkey]], accusing [[Turkey and Israel diplomatic relations | Ankara]] of playing a negative role in [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]] and attempting to make the country a Turkish protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israeli defense minister]] warned the new government in Damascus of a heavy price if hostile forces were stationed in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Outlook on [[Potential conflict and escalation between Turkey and Israel | Conflict]]

Given their poor [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | relations]] and [[Israel's Defense and International Reactions | Israel]]'s clear statement over Turkish encroachment in [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]], the two countries appear to be on a dangerous collision course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

While a [[potential_conflict_and_escalation_between_turkey_and_israel | confrontation]] could be limited to [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]], potentially involving local proxies or cyber attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, the potential for a disastrous [[potential_conflict_and_escalation_between_turkey_and_israel | escalation]] is obvious due to both being significant regional military powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Such a [[potential_conflict_and_escalation_between_turkey_and_israel | confrontation]] could plunge [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]] back into chaos, drawing in other regional actors and potentially reigniting the civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This worrying situation is compounded by questions about the United States' capability to manage such a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

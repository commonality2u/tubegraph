For the past decade, France has been engaged in a challenging mission against Islamist insurgents in the Sahel region of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This engagement has faced increasing difficulties, with tensions reaching a boiling point with local countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite being unable to militarily win the conflict, France faces a seemingly impossible choice regarding its withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While international attention has often focused on US-led counter-terrorism efforts in the Middle East and Afghanistan, France's significant role in addressing growing radicalism in Africa has received less focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Sahel Region: Context

The Sahel is a semi-arid region in northern Africa, stretching approximately 5,400 kilometres (3,300 miles) from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, and about 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. It covers around 3 million square kilometres (1.2 million square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The current focus of the conflict is on the central and western parts of this arc, specifically Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These five countries have a combined population of approximately 90 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Historical Overview

The region's history has been significantly shaped by Islam, which arrived in the 8th century and became the main religion in the Mali Empire by 1300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. By the 17th century, Islam was firmly embedded, and today most of the population in these five countries are Sunni Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

During the late 19th-century European colonial "scramble for Africa," the Sahel region came under French rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This lasted until 1960, when the five Sahel countries, along with nine other French colonies in sub-Saharan Africa, gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Post-independence, France maintained close economic, political, and military ties with its former colonies, conducting over 60 military operations across the continent to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. In the Sahel, France established a permanent military presence in Chad in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Rise of Islamist Extremism and Early French Involvement

The current conflict began with rising Islamist extremism in the late 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Offshoots of groups in the Middle East, such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Movement of Unity and Jihad in Western Africa (MUJAO), emerged in North and West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. In response, France launched its first counter-terrorism mission, Operation Sabre, in Burkina Faso in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The situation worsened dramatically in 2011 with the Libyan civil war, which led to an influx of arms into northern Mali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This strengthened insurgencies led by Tuareg separatists and Islamist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Mali's military staged a coup in March 2012 due to loss of confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. By late 2012, Islamist forces, having defeated the Tuaregs, pushed towards the Malian capital, Bamako <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

On December 20, 2012, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2085, condemning the coup but also calling for assistance to Mali's security forces and authorizing an African-led International Support Mission (AFISMA) under ECOWAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, the situation deteriorated rapidly, leading France to launch Operation Serval on January 11, 2013, at Mali's request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Operation Serval, cooperating with AFISMA and an EU training mission, held the ground until a 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, was deployed in July 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. French forces, working with the UN, pushed back Islamist groups, and elections were held in Mali, leading to the end of Operation Serval on July 31, 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## [[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | Operation Barkhane]]

Despite initial improvements, the Islamist threat persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The very next day, August 1, 2014, a new [[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | French military mission]], Operation Barkhane, began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Consisting of 3,000 French troops, it integrated French missions in Chad and Burkina Faso to work with the security forces of the five Sahel states (G5) to counter Islamist insurgencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Hopes that the insurgency could be contained, encouraged by a 2015 peace agreement in Mali, were dashed as activity intensified in 2016 and 2017 with the emergence of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This violence also spread to Niger and Burkina Faso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. By 2020, the situation was bleak:
*   Over 10,000 deaths, including more than 50 French soldiers and hundreds of G5 troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   An estimated 2 million people displaced and 4 million in need of humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Annual cost to France was around a billion euros, roughly three-quarters of its overseas military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

In response, France sought to expand its counter-insurgency mission by involving other European partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Task Force Takuba, a new special forces counter-terrorism initiative, was created under Operation Barkhane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. It included contributions from Estonia, Sweden, Romania, Italy, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, among others, serving alongside Malian and other G5 forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## [[tensions_and_challenges_of_operation_barkhane | Tensions and Challenges]]

Despite these efforts, the situation continued to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The French presence in the Sahel came under increasing political strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>:
*   **Malian Coups**: A military coup overthrew the government in Mali in August 2020, followed by a second "coup within a coup" in May 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. These coups, condemned by France and ECOWAS, severely strained relations between Paris and Bamako <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Popular Opposition**: Many ordinary Malians accused France of failing to secure the situation, leading to growing opposition at a popular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Strategic Differences**: Calls for dialogue with insurgents emerged from within the region, but France steadfastly refused to negotiate with terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Amidst increasing domestic French opposition to the expensive mission, President Emmanuel Macron announced on June 10, 2021, that Operation Barkhane would conclude in early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. France planned to reduce its troop presence to 2,500-3,000, while remaining committed to counter-terrorism efforts like Takuba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Mali's military regime reacted angrily, accusing France of abandonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Tensions escalated when Mali signed a security agreement with the Wagner Group, a private military organization believed to be linked to the Russian defense ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. As French forces withdrew from northern Mali bases at the end of 2021, Russian mercenaries moved in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

In 2022, the situation further deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>:
*   Another military coup overthrew the government in Burkina Faso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Mali ordered over 100 recently arrived Danish troops to leave, arguing they were there without permission, casting doubt on international counter-insurgency efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   The French foreign minister accused Mali's military rulers of being "illegitimate" and "out of control," leading to the expulsion of the French ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## French Dilemma and [[geopolitical_implications_for_france_and_the_sahel_region | Geopolitical Implications]]

France's counter-insurgency efforts in the Sahel are now precarious, with a catastrophic breakdown in relations between Paris and local leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. As French Defence Minister Florence Parly stated, "we can't remain in Mali whatever the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

However, France faces significant challenges if it were to leave completely:
*   **Undermining UN Mission**: A withdrawal could undermine the ongoing UN peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA) in Mali, which relies on counter-insurgency efforts to create conditions for protecting civilians and extending government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Insurgent Expansion**: Allowing insurgents to gain further ground could lead to areas becoming powerful training facilities for radicals who may eventually target Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Regional Destabilization**: The challenge, currently centered on Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad, could destabilize other countries like Togo, Senegal, and Ivory Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Coupled with ongoing activity in [[security_threats_and_violence_in_nigeria | northern Nigeria]], much of West Africa could become highly unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Loss of Prestige**: A complete withdrawal would be a major blow to France's prestige as an international leader in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Accusations of Neo-colonialism**: Conversely, staying under current circumstances risks further resentment and accusations of neo-colonialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **[[geopolitical_implications_for_france_and_the_sahel_region | Geopolitical Implications]]**: Moscow's growing influence in the region, exemplified by the Wagner Group's presence, is a concern for French and wider Western policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The situation is further complicated by the French presidential election in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | French-led international efforts]] against Islamist activity in the Sahel have encountered deep problems in late 2021 and early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. With growing tensions and decreasing popular support both domestically and in the region, France's position is increasingly untenable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The military takeovers in Mali and Burkina Faso demonstrate frustration with the failure to deal with the groups and have undermined efforts to foster democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Observers suggest that, similar to the United States in Afghanistan, France may be caught in an unwinnable bind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. If it cannot fully withdraw, France faces a choice: either accept being in an unwinnable war and promote dialogue with insurgents, or commit to a never-ending conflict that will increasingly alienate local leaders and populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
